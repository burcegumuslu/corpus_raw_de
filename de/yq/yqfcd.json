W\u00e4hlen Sie unten eine Ursache aus, um mehr dar\u00fcber zu erfahren und einzelne Themen zu durchsuchen.\nVerschw\u00f6rungsglauben\nEs ist eine Verschw\u00f6rung!\nIn general, conspiracy theories tend to become more prominent when people feel threatened or fear a loss of control, because the theories allow people to cope with threatening events by focusing blame on a set of presumed conspirators....\n[\u00dcber die Einstellungsursache](/de/conspiracist-ideation/)\nMisstrauen\nIch traue der Sache nicht!\nOne of the strongest predictors of vaccine hesitancy is people\u2019s general mistrust of authorities, pharmaceutical companies, scientists, the medical \u201cestablishment\u201d, and scientific research methods and findings...\n[\u00dcber die Einstellungsursache](/de/distrust/)\nReligi\u00f6se Bedenken\nEs ist eine S\u00fcnde!\nNo major faith explicitly opposes vaccinations. On the contrary, all major faiths in the U.K. have urged their followers to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Nonetheless, several concerns about vaccinations have been identified that arise from religious considerations. These concerns can be divided into four groups....\n[\u00dcber die Einstellungsursache](/de/religious-concerns/)\nWeltanschauung und Politik\nDas ist nicht meine Sicht der Dinge!\nPolitical leanings are a known driver of people\u2019s attitudes towards scientific findings that are politically charged. A large body of research has established that people with right-wing political views are presently more likely to reject scientific findings than people on the left. This association varies in magnitude from small to substantial depending on the domain....\n[\u00dcber die Einstellungsursache](/de/worldview-and-politics/)\nUngerechtfertigte \u00dcberzeugungen\nEs gibt bessere Wege!\nSome people will reject vaccinations based on unwarranted beliefs, for example the claim that the body has a \u201cnatural healing potential\u201d or that \u201cnatural\u201d is always better, which may lead people to believe that suffering a \u201cnatural\u201d disease in order to achieve subsequent immunity is preferable to being vaccinated...\n[\u00dcber die Einstellungsursache](/de/unwarranted-beliefs/)\n\u00c4ngste und Phobien\nEs ist be\u00e4ngstigend!\nVaccination fears, which tend to be disproportionate to actual risks, are usually of two types. One type involves fears related to suffering side effects, whether plausible or implausible, such as autism, cancer, autoimmune diseases, neurodevelopmental disorders or even death...\n[\u00dcber die Einstellungsursache](/de/fear-and-phobias/)\nMoralische Bedenken\nEs ist unmoralisch!\nSome people may feel that vaccines are contrary to their moral stance. This is likely when individuals perceive vaccinations as promoting immoral behaviour or as being developed using immoral means. Several studies have found that moral values play a role in vaccine opposition....\n[\u00dcber die Einstellungsursache](/de/moral-concerns/)\nReaktanz\nEs ist meine Entscheidung!\nReactance is a well-known psychological construct which describes an individual's tendency to defend their autonomy when they perceive that others are trying to impose their will on them. Individuals considered to have high reactance may respond to any health advice as an infringement on their ability to choose an action for themselves. High reactance has been consistently associated with vaccine hesitancy...\n[\u00dcber die Einstellungsursache](/de/reactance/)\nVerzerrte Risikowahrnehmung\nDas ist es nicht wert!\nPeople often have a distorted perception of the risk from a disease, either to themselves or to others. Specifically, people may perceive that a disease is of low or inconsequential risk, and this motivates their belief that vaccination is unnecessary or that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits...\n[\u00dcber die Einstellungsursache](/de/distorted-risk-perception/)\nVermeintliche Eigeninteressen\nAndere profitieren davon!\nGetting vaccinated is a prosocial act because it offers protection not only to the person who is vaccinated, but also to the community as a whole because every vaccination contributes to herd immunity. However, if nearly everyone gets vaccinated so that herd immunity is achieved, then it is possible for an individual to decide against vaccination and to \u201cfree ride\u201d on others in the community who are vaccinated...\n[\u00dcber die Einstellungsursache](/de/self-interest/)\nEpistemischer Relativismus\nDas ist nicht meine Wahrheit!\nEpistemic relativism is a philosophical view which holds that scientific \u201cfacts\u201d are products of social conventions and frameworks of assessment (e.g., historical contexts, social and cultural norms, and individual standards). According to strict relativists, there can be no framework-independent point of view from which we can obtain objective knowledge...\n[\u00dcber die Einstellungsursache](/de/epistemic-relativism/)",
