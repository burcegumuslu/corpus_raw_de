The aim is to lessen the anxiety and uncertainty associated with being a wait-listed hoping to get an\noffer, and decreases the time in determining residency matches. The process that will be used is described below.\nResidency Program Hosts:\nAfter interviewing and reviewing the applicants to their residency program, the resident selection committee at each of the\nsites determines who they would accept into the program, and provide their ranking on a Residency Preference List (RPL).\nThe Residency Program Host can only list those candidates who have interviewed for the position.\nResident Applicant:\nAfter consideration of all of the sites that s/he applied for, the applicant will submit his/her RPL. The RPL ranks the\nall of residency sites that s/he would accept, regardless of the ranking\nindicated. The candidate can list on their RPL only those residencies that the applicant interviewed for.\nResidency Matching Committee:\nThe residency matching committee reviews the\nfrom all of the candidates and the affiliate sites, and proceeds in\nmatching the sites with their preferred match. The process is quite straightforward and can be demonstrated in the\nfollowing way.\nSite\nSelection based on Site RPL (in descending\norder of preference)\nCandidate\nSelection based on Candidate RPL (in\ndescending order of preference)\nSite A\nCandidates 1, 3, 2, 6\nCandidate 1 Sites A, C, D, B\nSite B\nCandidates 1, 2, 4, 3, 5\nCandidate 2 Sites A, B, C\nSite C\nCandidates 2, 4, 6, 1\nCandidate 3 Sites B, A, C, D\nSite D\nCandidates 3, 2, 1, 6, 4\nCandidate 4 Sites E, A\nSite E\nCandidates 6, 5, 1\nCandidate 5 Sites A, E, D, C, B\nCandidate 6 Sites A, E, B\nIdeally, the first choice candidate for the residency site would be the chosen first choice site for the candidate. As can be\nseen above, Site A and Candidate 1 match.\nSite\nSelection based on Site RPL (in descending\norder of preference)\nCandidate\nSelection based on Candidate RPL (in\ndescending order of preference)\nSite A\nCandidates 1, 3, 2, 6\nCandidate 1 Sites A, C, D, B\nSite B\nCandidates 1, 2, 4, 3, 5\nCandidate 2 Sites A, B, C\nSite C\nCandidates 2, 4, 6, 1\nCandidate 3 Sites B, A, C, D\nSite D\nCandidates 3, 2, 1, 6, 4\nCandidate 4 Sites E, A\nSite E\nCandidates 6, 5, 1\nCandidate 5 Sites A, E, D, C, B\nCandidate 6 Sites A, E, B\nr first choice, we consider Site\nnext choice, which is Candidate 2.\nPage 25\nCanadian College of Naturopathic Medicine\n1255 Sheppard Avenue East\nToronto, Ontario Canada M2K 1E2\nTelephone: 416-498-1255\nFax: 416-498-3177\n2013 Residency Application Package\n24\npreference is Site B. Therefore, Site B is matched with Candidate 2. It should be noted that while Candidate 3 indicated\nSite B as his/her first choice, Candidate 3 was not preferentially selected by Site B (compared to Candidate 2).\nSite\nSelection based on Site RPL (in descending\norder of preference)\nCandidate\nSelection based on Candidate RPL (in\ndescending order of preference)\nSite A\nCandidates 1, 3, 2, 6\nCandidate 1 Sites A, C, D, B\nSite B\nCandidates 1, 2, 4, 3, 5\nCandidate 2 Sites A, B, C\nSite C\nCandidates 2, 4, 5, 1\nCandidate 3 Sites B, A, C, D\nSite D\nCandidates 3, 2, 1, 5, 4\nCandidate 4 Sites E, A\nSite E\nCandidates 2, 5, 1\nCandidate 5 Sites A, E, D, C, B\nCandidate 6 Sites A, E, B\n, and its second choice has not been matched. However, in reviewing\nhoice which is Candidate 5. Candidate 5\nlisted Site C in his/her RPL, so in this scenario, Candidate 5 is matched with Site C.\nSite\nSelection based on Site RPL (in descending\norder of preference)\nCandidate\nSelection based on Candidate RPL (in\ndescending order of preference)\nSite A\nCandidates 1, 3, 2, 6\nCandidate 1 Sites A, C, D, B\nSite B\nCandidates 1, 2, 4, 3, 5\nCandidate 2 Sites A, B, C\nSite C\nCandidates 2, 4, 5, 1\nCandidate 3 Sites B, A, C, D\nSite D\nCandidates 3, 2, 1, 5, 4\nCandidate 4 Sites E, A\nSite E\nCandidates 2, 5, 1\nCandidate 5 Sites A, E, D, C, B\nCandidate 6 Sites A, E, B\nCandidate 3 included Site D in its RPL (i.e. would accept a residency position regardless of its ranking), so Candidate 3\nwill be matched with Site D.\nSite\nSelection based on Site RPL (in descending\norder of preference)\nCandidate\nSelection based on Candidate RPL (in\ndescending order of preference)\nSite A\nCandidates 1, 3, 2, 6\nCandidate 1 Sites A, C, D, B\nSite B\nCandidates 1, 2, 4, 3, 5\nCandidate 2 Sites A, B, C\nSite C\nCandidates 2, 4, 5, 1\nCandidate 3 Sites B, A, C, D\nSite D\nCandidates 3, 2, 1, 5, 4\nCandidate 4 Sites E, A\nSite E\nCandidates 2, 5, 1, 6\nCandidate 5 Sites A, E, D, C, B\nCandidate 6 Sites A, E, B\nSite\n3 preferences have all been matched according to the top preferences of the candidates. While Candidate 4\nselected Site E as his/her top choice, Site E did not list Candidate 4 in their Preferred List. Therefore there is no match\nbetween Site E and Candidate 4.\nCandidate 6 will be matched with Site E. In this case Candidate 4 does not have a match.\nSummary:\nThe Residency Matching Committee facilitates the process of the systematic matching of candidate and site preference\nlists. It depends on the RPL to create the match.\nPage 26\nCanadian College of Naturopathic Medicine\n1255 Sheppard Avenue East\nToronto, Ontario Canada M2K 1E2\nTelephone: 416-498-1255\nFax: 416-498-3177\n2013 Residency Application Package\n25\nResident Preference List (RPL)\nInstructions:\n1.

The aim is to lessen the anxiety and uncertainty associated with being a wait-listed hoping to get an\noffer, and decreases the time in determining residency matches. The process that will be used is described below.\nResidency Program Hosts:\nAfter interviewing and reviewing the applicants to their residency program, the resident selection committee at each of the\nsites determines who they would accept into the program, and provide their ranking on a Residency Preference List (RPL).\nThe Residency Program Host can only list those candidates who have interviewed for the position.\nResident Applicant:\nAfter consideration of all of the sites that s/he applied for, the applicant will submit his/her RPL. The RPL ranks the\nall of residency sites that s/he would accept, regardless of the ranking\nindicated. The candidate can list on their RPL only those residencies that the applicant interviewed for.\nResidency Matching Committee:\nThe residency matching committee reviews the\nfrom all of the candidates and the affiliate sites, and proceeds in\nmatching the sites with their preferred match. The process is quite straightforward and can be demonstrated in the\nfollowing way.\nSite\nSelection based on Site RPL (in descending\norder of preference)\nCandidate\nSelection based on Candidate RPL (in\ndescending order of preference)\nSite A\nCandidates 1, 3, 2, 6\nCandidate 1 Sites A, C, D, B\nSite B\nCandidates 1, 2, 4, 3, 5\nCandidate 2 Sites A, B, C\nSite C\nCandidates 2, 4, 6, 1\nCandidate 3 Sites B, A, C, D\nSite D\nCandidates 3, 2, 1, 6, 4\nCandidate 4 Sites E, A\nSite E\nCandidates 6, 5, 1\nCandidate 5 Sites A, E, D, C, B\nCandidate 6 Sites A, E, B\nIdeally, the first choice candidate for the residency site would be the chosen first choice site for the candidate. As can be\nseen above, Site A and Candidate 1 match.\nSite\nSelection based on Site RPL (in descending\norder of preference)\nCandidate\nSelection based on Candidate RPL (in\ndescending order of preference)\nSite A\nCandidates 1, 3, 2, 6\nCandidate 1 Sites A, C, D, B\nSite B\nCandidates 1, 2, 4, 3, 5\nCandidate 2 Sites A, B, C\nSite C\nCandidates 2, 4, 6, 1\nCandidate 3 Sites B, A, C, D\nSite D\nCandidates 3, 2, 1, 6, 4\nCandidate 4 Sites E, A\nSite E\nCandidates 6, 5, 1\nCandidate 5 Sites A, E, D, C, B\nCandidate 6 Sites A, E, B\nr first choice, we consider Site\nnext choice, which is Candidate 2.\nPage 35\nCanadian College of Naturopathic Medicine\n1255 Sheppard Avenue East\nToronto, Ontario Canada M2K 1E2\nTelephone: 416-498-1255\nFax: 416-498-3177\n2013 Residency Application Package\n24\npreference is Site B. Therefore, Site B is matched with Candidate 2. It should be noted that while Candidate 3 indicated\nSite B as his/her first choice, Candidate 3 was not preferentially selected by Site B (compared to Candidate 2).\nSite\nSelection based on Site RPL (in descending\norder of preference)\nCandidate\nSelection based on Candidate RPL (in\ndescending order of preference)\nSite A\nCandidates 1, 3, 2, 6\nCandidate 1 Sites A, C, D, B\nSite B\nCandidates 1, 2, 4, 3, 5\nCandidate 2 Sites A, B, C\nSite C\nCandidates 2, 4, 5, 1\nCandidate 3 Sites B, A, C, D\nSite D\nCandidates 3, 2, 1, 5, 4\nCandidate 4 Sites E, A\nSite E\nCandidates 2, 5, 1\nCandidate 5 Sites A, E, D, C, B\nCandidate 6 Sites A, E, B\n, and its second choice has not been matched. However, in reviewing\nhoice which is Candidate 5. Candidate 5\nlisted Site C in his/her RPL, so in this scenario, Candidate 5 is matched with Site C.\nSite\nSelection based on Site RPL (in descending\norder of preference)\nCandidate\nSelection based on Candidate RPL (in\ndescending order of preference)\nSite A\nCandidates 1, 3, 2, 6\nCandidate 1 Sites A, C, D, B\nSite B\nCandidates 1, 2, 4, 3, 5\nCandidate 2 Sites A, B, C\nSite C\nCandidates 2, 4, 5, 1\nCandidate 3 Sites B, A, C, D\nSite D\nCandidates 3, 2, 1, 5, 4\nCandidate 4 Sites E, A\nSite E\nCandidates 2, 5, 1\nCandidate 5 Sites A, E, D, C, B\nCandidate 6 Sites A, E, B\nCandidate 3 included Site D in its RPL (i.e. would accept a residency position regardless of its ranking), so Candidate 3\nwill be matched with Site D.\nSite\nSelection based on Site RPL (in descending\norder of preference)\nCandidate\nSelection based on Candidate RPL (in\ndescending order of preference)\nSite A\nCandidates 1, 3, 2, 6\nCandidate 1 Sites A, C, D, B\nSite B\nCandidates 1, 2, 4, 3, 5\nCandidate 2 Sites A, B, C\nSite C\nCandidates 2, 4, 5, 1\nCandidate 3 Sites B, A, C, D\nSite D\nCandidates 3, 2, 1, 5, 4\nCandidate 4 Sites E, A\nSite E\nCandidates 2, 5, 1, 6\nCandidate 5 Sites A, E, D, C, B\nCandidate 6 Sites A, E, B\nSite\n3 preferences have all been matched according to the top preferences of the candidates. While Candidate 4\nselected Site E as his/her top choice, Site E did not list Candidate 4 in their Preferred List. Therefore there is no match\nbetween Site E and Candidate 4.\nCandidate 6 will be matched with Site E. In this case Candidate 4 does not have a match.\nSummary:\nThe Residency Matching Committee facilitates the process of the systematic matching of candidate and site preference\nlists. It depends on the RPL to create the match.\nPage 36\nCanadian College of Naturopathic Medicine\n1255 Sheppard Avenue East\nToronto, Ontario Canada M2K 1E2\nTelephone: 416-498-1255\nFax: 416-498-3177\n2013 Residency Application Package\n25\nResident Preference List (RPL)\nInstructions:\n1.
