S\u00f6mmering discovered the macula in the [retina](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Retina.html) of the human [eye](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Eye.html). His investigations on the [brain](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Brain.html) and the [nervous system](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Nervous_system.html), on the sensory organs, on the [embryo](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Embryo.html) and its malformations, on the structure of the [lungs](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Lung.html), etc., made him one of the most important German anatomists.\nAdditional recommended knowledge\nCareer\nS\u00f6mmering was born in Thorn (Toru\u0144), Polish Royal Prussia, as the ninth child of the physician Johann Thomas S\u00f6mmering. In 1774 he completed his education in Thorn and began to study\n[medicine](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Medicine.html) at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. He became a professor of anatomy at the Collegium Carolinum in Kassel and, beginning in 1784, at the University of Mainz. There he was for five years the dean of the medical faculty. In 1795 S\u00f6mmering opened up a practice in Frankfurt. As one of his many important enterprises, S\u00f6mmering introduced against many resistances the [vaccination](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Vaccination.html) against smallpox and became one of the first members of the Senckenbergische Naturforschende Gesellschaft and was nominated as counselor. He received offers of employment by the University of Jena and the University of St. Petersburg, but accepted in 1804 an invitation from the Academy of Science of Bavaria, in Munich. In this city, he became counselor to the court and was led into the Bavarian nobility.\nWhen S\u00f6mmering was 23 years old he described the organization of the\n[cranial nerves](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Cranial_nerves.html) as part of this doctoral work: its study is valid until today. He published many writings in the fields of medicine, anatomy and [neuroanatomy](https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Neuroanatomy.html), anthropology, paleontology, astronomy and philosophy. Among other things he wrote about fossil crocodiles and Archaeopteryx. He was also the first to accurately draw a representation of the female skeleton structure.\nIn addition, S\u00f6mmering was a very creative inventor, having designed a telescope for astronomical observations and an electrical telegraph in 1809. he worked on the refinement of wines, sunspots and many diverse other things. In 1811 he developed the first telegraphic system in Bavaria, which is housed today in the German Museum of Science in Munich.\nS\u00f6mmering was married to Margarethe Elizabeth Grunelius (deceased 1802), and had a son, Dietmar William, and a daughter, Susanne Katharina. Due to bad weather, S\u00f6mmering left Munich in 1820 and returned to Frankfurt, where he died in 1830. He is buried at the city's main cemetery.\nWorks\n- \u00dcber die k\u00f6rperliche Verschiedenheit des Mohren vom Europ\u00e4r (1774)\n- Vom Hirn- und R\u00fcckenmark (Mainz 1788, 2.
