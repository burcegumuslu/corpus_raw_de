It focuses on the question whether the treatment of \nmigraine patients differs from  the treatment of  other patients, how the treatment \napproaches precisely look like, whether t here are any special techniques for the \ntreatment of migraine patients, whic h successes can be achieved and what \ndetermines the interaction bet ween therapist and patient. \nThese questions shall be answered by means of a qualitative study which resorts to \nguideline-oriented interviews as resear ch tool. Therefore seven experienced \nosteopaths with many years of practice are interviewed. An analysis of the interviews \nshows that migraine patients usually c onsult osteopaths only after having been \nexamined by conventional medical practitioners and thus after having been \ndiagnosed with the disease already. Further more it revealed that in anamnesis and \nduring the clinical examinations of migr aine patients the osteopaths proceed in no \ndifferently than when examinin g any other patients. Due to  the holistic approach of \nthe osteopaths, impacts on all system s (vascular, hormonal, neurochemic, \nmyofascial, mental, structural etc.) can be found. According to the interviewees, \nduring the treatments main ly the craniosacral model complemented by the \nbiodynamic model is applied. Thereby t he osteopaths hardly use any specific \ntechniques, but rather a holistic approach,  as it generally fits the nature of \nosteopathy. In case of migraine patients it is very important to pay special attention to \nwhat the patient says, as this enables the osteopath to give more specific advice to \nthe individual patients. Furthermore it seems to be important to be particularly \ncautious in dealing with migr aine patients. All osteopaths agree that by means of \nosteopathic treatments intens ity, as well as frequency of migraine attacks, can be \ninfluenced positively.  Keywords: migraine, qualitative study, os teopathic treatment, craniosacral model, \nbiodynamic model, structural model, viscera l model, interaction, treatment success, \ntreatment interval - 4 -  \n1 Introduction  \nMigraine is a frequently occurring disorder th at greatly reduces the quality of life of \nthose who suffer from it. Studi es reveal that migraine affe cts the quality of life in a \nbodily, mental and social way (Terwindt 2000 ). According to a 2004 WHO statistics 6 \nto 8 % of all men and 15 to 18 % of all women in Europe and America suffer from \nmigraine. According to a study conducted by  the AKH Linz (General Hospital Linz) \nand the hospital of St. P\u00f6lten (Leitner 2006) 10,2 per  cent of all Austrian suffer from \nmigraine. Hence we as osteopaths are frequent ly confronted with this disease pattern \nas well. Thus there are also osteopathi c studies (Spannbauer 2008, Ecker 2003, van \nTintelon 2002, Loza 1998) that reveal the effectiveness of osteopathy with regard to \nmigraine. However, while studying rele vant literature I could hardly find any \nindications for the osteopathic treatment  of migraine patients on the part of \nconventional medicine.  In this context it is interesting to conduct a research about which treatment \napproaches are used in osteopat hy for the therapy of mi graine patients. For this \npurpose I would like to summarize osteopat hic as well as conventional medical \nliterature, starting from my experiences during the osteopat hic training at the Wiener \nSchule f\u00fcr Osteopathie (Vienna School of Os teopathy), short WSO, and my practical \nwork as an osteopath. After that, I would like  to interview some osteopaths, in order \nto find out about all facets of  their treatment of  migraine patients in their surgeries. \nThereby I shall be particularly interested to  what extent the work with migraine \npatients differs from the wo rk with other patients, how the approaches of treatment \nlook like in detail, whether there are ce rtain special techniques, which successes can \nbe achieved by means of an osteopathic treat ment, what the patient is recommended \nand by what the interaction between ther apist and patient is shaped. In this \nconnection I would furthermore like to evaluat e the hypothesis whether working in the \ncranio-sacral model is of particular importanc e for the treatment of  migraine patients. \nI would then like to bring in line my result s from the interviews with osteopaths with \nthose from literature, in order to more precisely de scribe migraine from the \nperspective of osteopathy. It s hall be one aim of this thesis, to provide a basis for a - 5 - fruitful communication between osteopaths and conventional medical practitioners. \nAnother aim shall be to reveal to other osteopaths the possibilit ies and demands for \nthe treatment of migr aine patients. Therefore I do not w ant to offer a \u201ccooking recipe\u201c \nfor the treatment of migraine, but I would like to give an insight into  the work and way \nof thinking of other osteopaths. Therewith I would like to point out that osteopathy, as \na non-medicinal treatment, should be grant ed a higher importance concerning the \ntreatment of migraine and thus should be recommended by conventional medicine as \na complementary therapy. \n2 Present state of knowledge concerning migraine  \nThere is manifold literature regarding the subject of migraine that extensively deals \nwith pathophysiology and medicina l treatment. However, in my thesis I would like to \nconcentrate mainly on the definition of migr aine, on trigger factor s as well as on well-\nknown methods of treatment, as my paper is based on the conduction and evaluation \nof expert interviews with practicing osteopaths, which means that the topics \nmentioned above are of great importance.  \n2.1 Definition of migraine  \nMigraine (from Greek hemicranion, hemicrani a \u2013 meaning half skull) is a multifaceted \ndisorder, which is characterized by a s udden, pulsatile and unilateral headache that \nis often accompanied by complaints of  the autonomic nervous system and comes \nalong with additional symptoms such as  nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity \n(photophobia) or sensitivity to noise (phonophobia). Migraine headache occurs \nperiodically in the form of attacks. Due to the chronology of the single complaints, a \ntypical migraine attack can be divided into four different phases : prodromal phase \n(precursors), aura, headache with accom panying symptoms and migraine hangover \n(Keidel 2007).  - 6 - \n \nFig 1: Schematic depiction of the c ourse of a migraine attack (Keidel \n2007, p. 25) \nAs the aura phase occurs in only 10-15% of a ll cases, I will not go into further detail \nconcerning migraine with aura, since ther eby no additional information regarding the \naim of my investigation can be achieved.  \nMigraine is a frequent, high ly handicapping syndrome wit h a variety of social \neconomic and personal effects. Thus the Wo rld Health Organization lists migraine on \nthe 19\nth rank of all diseases that cause disability (Keidel 2007). World Health \nOrganization (2004) gives information on the distribution of migraine: Commonly \nstarting at puberty, migraine most affect s those aged between 35 and 45 years but \ncan trouble much younger people, includi ng children. Eur opean and American \nstudies have shown that 6-8% of men and 15-18% of women experience migraine \neach year. Migraine appears somewhat less pr evalent, but still common, in Asia (3% \nof men and 10% of women) and in Africa (3-7% in community-based studies). Major \nstudies have yet to be conducted (World Health Organization 2004). According to a study conducted by the AKH  Linz (General Hospital Linz) and the \nhospital of St. P\u00f6lten, 10,2% of all Aust rians suffer from migr aine, whereby women \nare affected 2,5 times as frequently as m en. Before puberty boys are more frequently \naffected than girls, which is a clear indica tion for the influence of hormonal factors on \nthe development of mi graine (Leitner 2006). \n \n2.2 Clinical aspects of migraine\n \nThe clinical aspects of migr aine are specified by means of  various criteria by the \nInternational Headache Society (IHS) (H eadache Classification Subcommittee of the \nHeadache Society 2004). According to this  classification migraine without aura Prodromalphase = prodrome \nKopfschmerz und Begleitsymptome = headache and \naccompanying symptoms \nM\u00fcdigkeit, Reizbarkeit, Hei\u00dfhunger, Harndrang = fatigue, \nirritability, ravenous appetite, increased urination \nErholungsphase = migraine hangover Sehst\u00f6rungen, neurologische Ausf\u00e4 lle = visual disturbance, \nneurological deficits \nM\u00fcdigkeit, Hyperaktivit\u00e4t = fatigue, hyperactivity - 7 - (\u201csimple migraine\u201c) is distinguished from  migraine with aura. According to the \nclassification of the HIS headaches have to  be regarded as manife station of simple \nmigraine if they occur unilaterally, are of a pulsatile character, do not last longer than \nthree days at a maximum are accompani ed by vegetative complaints and have \nalready occurred five times at least.  \n2.3 Diagnosis of migraine\n \nAs headache cannot be allocated by means of  any apparative method, diagnosis has \nto rely on anamnesis and clinical findings (Diener 2002). An extensive inquiry of the \nprevious medical history that is conduct ed together with the patient usually permits \ndiagnosing migraine. The followi ng criteria have to be met in  case of simple migraine \n(without aura): : \nMain features Criteria \nDuration 4 to 72 hours \nHeadache characteristics \n(at least 2) \n Unilateral headache \nPulsatile headache \nModerate or severe pain intensity \nAggravation by routine physical activity (e.g. walking or stair climbing) \nAccompanying complaints (at least one) Nausea \nVomiting \nPhotophobia \nPhonophobia \nNumber of attacks At leasz five previous attacks \nExclusion of sympotmatic headaches By means of medical examination \n \nFig.2: Criteria for diagnosing migrai ne without aura (Keidel 2007, p. 17) \n Evers 2006 includes as further criterion that  the pain switches from one side of the \nhead to the other during or in between t he attacks and mentions a lack of appetite \nand odor sensitivity  as further accom panying symptoms. Furthermore Evers 2006 \ndescribes certain pre-moods that occur bef ore the actual migraine attack and thus \npredict the attack (E vers 2006, p. 6):  - 8 - \u2022 Altered mood: depressive, depressive, bad tempered- aggressive or euphoric \nmood \n\u2022 Altered sensory perception, e.g. in creased irritation due to noise and odors \n\u2022 Altered digestion: increased feeling of  hunger, craving for chocolate, diarrhea, \nconstipation \n\u2022 Polyuria \n\u2022 Altered hormonal function (e.g . irregular menstrual cycle) \nThe conventional medical examinati on includes (Evers 2006, p. 8) \n\u2022 Neurologic examination \n\u2022 Examination of the cervical spine \n\u2022 Examination of jaw function and dental chart \n\u2022 Blood pressure measurement \n\u2022 Vascular status \n\u2022 Inspection of the skin \n\u2022 Auscultation of lung and heart \n\u2022 Palpation of the abdomen \n \nFurther technical investigation is only neces sary, if the previous  medical history and \nthe clinical-neurological findings are inco mpatible with the typical primary headache \nof migraine. In this case there is su spicion of secondary headache, which requires \nimaging examination of the brain. Such imaging proce dures would be the cranial \ncomputed tomography (CCT) as well as the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of \nthe brain. A summary of po ssible additional diagnostics c an be found in Keidel 2007. \nPET (positron-emission-tomogr aphy) and similar procedures are not really useful in \nclinical diagnostics and are mainly used fo r clearing scientific questions (cf. among \nothers Schonmann 2008 or Schulz 2007).  \n2.4 Pathophysiology\n \nPathophysiology describes which mechanisms in the human body lead to migraine \nand how differently the human body works under the changes caused by migraine. \n \n2.4.1 Genetic fundamentals  \nFrom anamnesis a clear connection between familial relation and disease becomes \nevident. Furthermore there are twin studi es, family examinations and molecular - 9 - genetic examinations that prove a genetic  connection (Thomsen 2007, Evers 2006, \nKeidel 2007).  \n2.4.2  Development of pain\n \nSo far the processes in the brain that l ead to a migraine attack are not yet entirely \nclarified (Olesen 2005). In literature va rious theories can be found whereby the \n\u201cvascular theory\u201c and the \u201cneurogenic inflamma tion\u201d seem to be the most important \nones.  \n2.4.3 Vascular theory\n \nBasically this theory is grounded on exam inations that were conducted around 1950 \nand assumes that during a migraine attack the blood vessels in the brain narrow. (Wolff 1948). Thus the area in the brain that is affected is supplied with less blood, \nwhich can lead to a temporary functional loss of the corresponding nerve cells. \nSubsequently the blood vessels expand. This vascular dilatation causes the typical \nmigraine pain.   Nowadays it seems verified that the vascula r theory does not play the most important \nrole for explaining the development of migraine pain (Goadsby 2008), i.e. that \nvascular dilatation is not responsible for the headaches. Examinations by means of \n3T magnetic resonance angiography (Sc honmann 2008) or sonography (Evers 2006) \ncould show that the devel opment of migraine pain cannot only be ascribed to an \naltered width of cerebral vessels. They revealed that migraine attacks have nothing \nto do with vascular dilatation of cer ebral or meningeal vessels (Schonmann \n2008).They conclude that, contrary to a longstanding and wi despread believe, \ncerebral and meningeal di ameter changes in migraine attacks if at all happening \nappear not to be of primary importance to  the pathophysiology of the migraine \nheadache.  - 10 - 2.4.4 Neurogenic inflammation   \nThis theory proceeds from a disturbed inte raction between nervous system and blood \nvessels: the fibers of the fifth cerebral nerve (trigeminal nerve) end in the large \ncerebral blood vessels and the cerebral memb rane (amongst others). If this nerve is \nirritated mechanically, electrically or chemically, a release of inflammation \nmessengers may be the consequence. These do not only cause a dilatation of arterial vessels, but also increase their wall permeability. Thus blood plasma can extravasate into the surrounding areas. This  causes bloating and the inflammation of \nthe brain tissue. Pain stimuli are sent  off and lead to migraine headache (Keidel \n2007, Evers 2006).   By means of PET examinations and functi onal MRI studies a region that showed a \nstrikingly increased metabolism during migr aine attacks could be found in the brain \nstem as well as in the mesencephalon (E vers 2006, Keil 2007, Schulz 2007, Bahra \n2001, Weiller 1995).  Keidel (2007) and Evers (2006) both take the view that it comes to a central \nfacilitation of the trigeminal  nerve. Thereby the activation of the brain stem, \u201cmigraine \ngenerator\u201c, leads to a hypersensitivity of trigeminal neurons in the caudal nucleus \n(Evers 2006). This is also where the affe rents from the cerebral membranes and \nblood vessels end. At the same time it co mes to an inhibition of antinociceptive \nneurons in periaqueductal  grey and locus caeruleus. Howe ver, the mechanism of this \ninhibition is not fully explained yet (Evers  2006). Thereby it comes to a decrease of \nthe pain threshold and thus to an elevated pa in sensitivity. It could be that thereby \nthe trigeminal vascular system is activat ed (Keidel 2006). Furthermore the activation \nof trigeminal neurons leads to a release of vasoactive neurotransmitters, above all \nCGRP (calcitonin-gene-rela ted-peptide) and serotonin (Evers 2006). These are \nreleased from trigeminal peripheral nerve  endings in the meningeal blood vessels. \nThese neuropeptides lead to a vascular dilatation of cerebral and dural blood vessels. As a consequence blood penetrates the vascular wall and extravasates into areas surrounding the vessels, which leads to  a release of inflammatory substances \n(e.g. histamine, serotonin) and finally to a neurogenic induced inflammation. This \nmeans that the stimulation of the pain receptors of t he trigeminal nerve in the - 11 - vascular wall by means of proteins that ar e released due to the inflammation of the \nvascular wall is what eventually triggers migraine pain.  \n2.4.5 Cortical stimulus processing\n \nA further aspect for the explanat ion of migraine pain is an al tered stimulus processing \nof migraine patients. Elec trophysiological experiments revealed that migraine \npatients show an elevated irrit ability of the nerve cells of the cerebral cortex (Keidel \n2007).  \n2.5 Trigger factors  \nComprehensive knowledge of the trigger fact ors of migraine is of utmost importance \nfor a successful treatment. T he conscious avoidance of such trigger factors can \npositively influence the frequency as well as  the severity of migraine attacks. \n \n2.5.1 Psychosocial strain   \nOne trigger factor of migr aine that is frequently mentioned in anamnesis is stress \n(Spannbauer 2008, Zivadinov 2003, Robbins 1994, Fukui 2008). Furthermore there are \u201cretrospective questionnaire studies\u201c, in  the course of which up to 62% of \nmigraine patients mention psychosocial stress as one important trigge r factor for their \nmigraine attacks (Schoonman 2007, Tuchin 2000) . Objective criteria associated with \nstress, such as cortisol-level , \u201cheart rate average\u201c or \u201chear t rate variability\u201c should not \nhave any direct influence before or dur ing migraine (Schoonman 2007). Besides \npsychic factors such as stress, relief a fter stress, fearful anticipation or special \nemotional situations also play an impor tant role (Leitner  2006, Keidel 2007). \n \n2.5.2 Altered weather conditions\n \nThe influence of (sudden) changes in t he weather and temperature changes are \nfurther important trigger fa ctors of migraine (Robbins 19 94, Zivadinov 2003). Z.B. \nRobbins 1994, for example, mentions this as second most importa nt trigger factor \nafter stress. Intense light and especially brig ht sun are also name d as trigger factors - 12 - (Robbins 1994). Furthermore a minor co rrelation with the changes of season has \nbeen detected as well (Robbins 1994).  \n2.5.3 Nutrition\n \nFood, such as chocolate, cheese, oranges, tomatoes, onions, glutamates, alcohol (in \nparticular red wine) and the excessive consumption of coffee are regarded as \nproblematic (Sahai-Srivastava 2008, M\u00fc ller 2007). Histamine containing food has \nalso been detected as being a potent ial trigger (Gazerani 2003).  \nIrregular meals, such as e.g. fasti ng (Fukui 2008) and a lack of carbohydrates \n(Robbins 1994, Evers 2006) were identif ied as trigger factors as well. \n \n2.5.4 Hormonal factors  \nHormonal variations such as mensturation,  pregnancy or the use of contraceptives \nhave been identified as tri gger factors (M\u00fcller 2007, Fukui 2008). Thereby in \nparticular premenstrual oestrogen drop pla ys an important role . Furthermore the \nstatistical data concerning t he uneven distribution of migraine to men and women is \nindicative for the impact  of hormonal factors (Wor ld Health Organization 2004). \n \n2.5.5 Sleep disorder and c hanges in the circadian rhythm  \nThere are several hints for a correlati on between migraine and circadian rhythm \n(Baumhackl 2007) or sleep disorder (Fukui 2008, Vgontzas 2008). Frequent \ntravelling has also been detected as being a trigger factor (Zivadinov 2003). \n \n2.5.6 Anatomic factors  \nSome migraine patients report that they su ffer from neck pain and stiff musculature \nbefore or during the migraine attack (Ga llagher 2005, M\u00fcller 2007, Biondi 2005, Blau \n1994, Hagino 1992). A significant restricti on of mobility, especially of the upper \ncervical spine and the suboccipital has  been detected (in particular c0-c1). \nFurthermore frequently tenderpoints in the u pper cervical spine and the suboccipital \ncould be found. This is similar in the case  of migraine and in the case of tension - 13 - headache (Hagino 1992; NB: no control group used in this study). Another study \nconfirms the restricted mobility of migraine patients and headache patients as \ncompared to a control gr oup (Kidd 1993). Scharff (1999) also detects a connection \nbetween positional abnormality and trigger poi nts of migraine and tension headache. \nCertainly anatomic connections are of great  importance here. Afferences end in the \nTrigeminocervicale Nucleus and the upper th ree cervical spinal nerves together with \nadditional fibres from N.facialis,N  glossopharyngeus and N vagus. The \nTrigeminocervicale Nucleus is the essentia l nociceptive nucleus of the head, throat \nand upper neck. Neurones in the C1 and C2 segments respond to stimulation of \nafferents in both the upper cervical spin alnerves and the trigeminal nerve. This \nconcurrence forms the basis for this sort  of pain that radi ates to head and upper \ncervical spine (Bogduk 1995).  \n2.6 Comorbidity\n \nIn addition to migraine very often other diagnostically delimitable disease patterns \noccur as well. Concerning this Keidel ( 2007) and Evers (2006) give an overview of \nthis comorbidity.  \n2.6.1 Accompanying neurological diseases\n \nWomen under the age of 40 who suffer from  migraine run a two tho three times \nhigher risk of suffering a stroke (Keidel 2007). Howeve r, the precise reasons \ntherefore have not been fully explained ye t. Possible reasons would be for example \nas vascular aspect such as vascular spasm or an open oval foramen.   \n2.6.2 Accompanying psychiatric diseases\n \nThere is a close connection and intera ction between migrai ne and depression \n(Breslau 2003). Keidel (2007)  hereto mentions numbers concerning frequencies: \nmigraine patients run a six times higher ri sk of developing depressions and a three \ntimes higher risk of develop ing anxiety disorders. \n - 14 - 2.6.3 Gastrointestinal diseases  \nThere is a three times elevated risk for mi graine patients to develop irritable bowel \nsyndrome (Keidel 2007).  \n2.6.4 Accompanying cardio-vascular diseases\n \nMigraine patients run a higher ri sk of suffering from arterial  hypertension or from the \nRaynaud\u2019s syndrome (Kei del 2007, Evers 2006). \n \n2.7 Migraine therapy  \nSeveral domestic remedies are recommended for the alleviation of migraine attacks, \nwhich are, however, not evidence-based (Evers 2006, p. 52):  \n\u2022 Rest  \n\u2022 Darken the room \n\u2022 Cooling of the forehead \n\u2022 Massaging pressure points of face and neck \n \n2.7.1 Medical treatment  \nCurrently existing medication al leviates migraine headache. Thereby different sorts of \ndrugs are used for acute treatment and prophy laxis, respectively. Concerning this \nthere is comprehensive literature, which is summarized, among others, by Mueller \n(2007), Gallagher (2005)  and Diener (2002).  \n \n2.7.1.1 Acute treatment \nThe most effective substances concer ning acute treatment are the so-called \nserotonin-receptor-agonists, called tript ans. These are specific migraine drugs and \ndo not have any effect in case of tension he adache. Very often it is necessary to take \nin several drugs simultaneously in order to  alleviate accompanying complaints, such \nas e.g. nausea (Keidel 2007). \n - 15 - 2.7.1.2 Prophylaxis \nFor medical prophylaxis several different su bstance groups are ava ilable. These are, \nabove all, beta-blocker and calcium-channel-blo cker. Substances of second choice \nfor migraine prophylaxis would be acetylsa licylic acid (ASA), non-steroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAID), antidepressants and maybe also selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). The positive effect of magnesium is debated; however \ntreatment with a high daily dose could pr obably slightly reduce the frequency of \nattacks (Evers 2006).  \n2.7.2 Biofeedback\n \nBiofeedback is a process in which the patient  is constantly informed about the active \nstate of tensions of neck muscles, masticat ory muscles and facial muscles as well as \nabout skin resistance and body temperature.  Thus, via technical feedback, the \npatient learns to become aware of usually unconscious bodily functions and, as a consequence, to consciously control and to  change them. Thus t he patient is enabled \nto consciously influence these bodily f unctions. In conventional medicine, \nbiofeedback is an accepted method for the prophy laxis of migraine. In  several clinical \nstudies it has proved to be effe ctive (Scharff 2002, Nestorivc 2007) \n \n2.7.3 Relaxation training\n \nIn this context, particularl y the muscle-centered relaxati on technique according to \nJacobson, has proved itself to be effect ive for migraine prophylaxis. It is also \nrecommended in combination with aerobic training and biofeedbac k (Keidel 2007). \n \n2.7.4 Cognitive behavioral therapy  \nIt is based on the biopsychosoc ial model of pain, which states that there are \nbiological, psychological and social factor s that are responsible for the maintenance \nand the subjective experience of chronic pain. This method tries to decrease the \nimpairment by pain and to increase self -control (Evers 2006, Martin 2007). \n - 16 - 2.7.5 Aerobic endurance sports  \nSeveral studies revealed that regular, moderate aerobic training may positively \ninfluence the frequency and intensity of mi graine attacks (Narin 2003, Darling 1991). \nIn particular in combination with relaxation  training it was quite effective (Dittrich \n2008).  \n2.7.6 Physiotherapy\n \nPhysiotherapy is regarded as an effective tr eatment of migraine if it is applied \ntogether with other treatm ents such as thermo-feedback, relaxation therapy and \nendurance training (Biondi 2005).  \n2.7.7 Acupuncture\n \nIn several clinical studies, acupuncture proved to be effective (Linde 2009). A \nreduction of frequency as well as of intensit y of migraine attacks could be achieved. \nHowever, particularly in the case of acupuncture the placebo-effect seems to be \nexceptionally high, as pseudo-acupuncture (w hich means that the needles were not \nplaced at the correct acupuncture points)  also had a positive influence on the \nmigraine process (Linde 2009). However, it c ould also be the case that by means of \nacupuncture, as well as by means of pseudo-acupuncture a positive effect on the \nautonomous nervous system is achieved (B\u00e4cker 2008). Thus acupuncture is \nregarded as effective prophylaxis for migraine and has, compared with medical \ntreatment, no side effects (Linde 2009).  \n2.7.8 Homeopathy\n \nIn literature no studies coul d be found that directly pr ove the effectiveness of a \nhomeopathic treatment of migraine. Possibl e successes of a homeopathic treatment \nrather correspond to a placebo-treat ment (Ernst 2002, Linde 1999). \n - 17 - 2.7.9 Chiropractic treatment  \nThere are several studies, which state that migraine attacks can be reduced by \nmeans of a manipulation of  the spine (Tuchin 2000, M\u00fcller 2007). However, the \nquality of some of these studies is contro versial, as in many cases no control group \nwas used or the number of test persons  was too small (Fern\u00e1ndez-de-las-Penas \n2006). Furthermore Biondi (2004) states t hat the chiropractic method is more \neffective in the case of tension headache than  for the treatment of  migraine. Tuchin \n(2000), on the other hand, could show by means of a clinical study that a chiropractic \ntreatment of the cervical spine can reduce migraine attacks. He traced the effect of \nthe chiropractic treatment back to an alternation of the pain sensitivity of the central \nnervous system. The trigeminal nucleus in nervates the cranium, as well as many \nintracranial and extracranial blood vessels. Afferents from the fi rst three cervical \nnerve roots also innervate the dura mater,  the scalp, and many suboccipital muscels. \nThis is a similiar mechanism to regiona l pain syndroms, and also suggested as one \nmechanis for serptonin action.  \n2.7.10 Diet\n \nAs food intolerance is one trigger factor of migraine (cf. ch. 2.5.3), a conscious \nchange of nutrition behavior is also re commended as a prophylactic measurement \nagainst migraine (M\u00fcller 2007). However, acco rding to Evers (2006), so far there is \nno evidence that the abandonment of certain nutritional co mponents or a change of \ndiet composition, respectively, can a lleviate or heal migraine headaches. Only a \nregular supply with carbohydrates is believ ed to be protective fr om migraine attacks.  \nThis, however, stands in contrast to the fi ndings mentioned in ch. 2.5.3, which state \nthat nutrition is a significant  trigger factor of migraine. \n \n2.7.11 Osteopathy  \nOnly very few conventional medical studi es that discuss the effectiveness of \nosteopathy on the treatment of migraine pat ients could be found. This conforms to \nBiondi (2004), who found no hint for the effectiveness of osteopathy or osteopathic \nmanipulation, respectively in relevant lit erature. However, according to him the - 18 - personal experience and convicti on of single osteopaths seem to verify the positive \neffects of osteopathy on the alleviation of pain. With this in mind I would like to \nsummarize the present state of knowledge from osteopathic books and publications \nof osteopaths in journals.  \n2.7.11.1.1 Migraine in osteopathic books \nStill (1910) classifies migraine among the di sease pattern of nervous disorders. \nAccording to him migraine means a weaken ed state of the whol e sympathetic system \nfrom atlas to coccyx. In the case of mi graine he starts treatm ent at the coccyx and \nends at the atlas. \u201eIch behaupt e, dass mir kein einziger solcher Fall mit wirklich \nnormalen Gelenkverbindungen im Kop f, Nacken, BWS, Lendengegend, Kreuz- und \nStei\u00dfbein begegnet ist\u201c. [I claim to have faced no such case with absolutely normal \nconjointments in head, neck, thoracic spine, lumbar region, sacrum and coccyx.] He \nfinds overburdened vertebral bodies and disp laced ribs which lead to an undersupply \nof the nervous system. During the treatment  he normalizes the position of spine and \ncostal junctions and thus takes away pressure from blood vessels and nerves.  Sutherland (1930) thinks that  migraine is caused by a traumatic, cranial form of \ndysfunction.  He often detects in such  cases a sphenobasilar sidebending/rotation \ndysfunction. From his point of view, reas ons therefore are to  be found in childhood \ntraumata (hits, falls). These lead to dysfunctions, which subsequently cause \nstructural malformations of t he cranium in later life. Sut herland very often detects in \nsuch cases a blocking of the major wings of the sphenoid bone.  Due to the \nmalposition of the sphenoid bone, logically the temporal bone is out of position as \nwell. This leads to a restricted mobility of  the skull base, which in turn leads to an \nanomalous tension of the corresponding membrane tissue, which causes the \nimpairment of the vascular c hannels. He calls this a cranial-membranous articular \nstrain. Sutherland tries to re-establis h mobility by means of the sphenobasilar \ntechnique and the pars petrosa technique.  Liem (2001) calls migraine and headache a multifactorial event. According to him, \nfrom a cranial perspective, several different  structures may be affected thereby (Liem \n2001, p. 567): - 19 - \u2022 SSB-dysfunctions including blocking of different  sutures \n\u2022 Tensions of the dura that affect the blood vessels \n\u2022 The vagus nerve can be impaired at t he jugular foramen due to dura tension \n\u2022 Upper cervical spine and tension of the neck muscles: the sensitive \ninnervation of one part of t he skull and of the dura runs via first three cervical \nnerves \n\u2022 Tension of hyoidal muscles and masticatory muscles \n\u2022 The blood vessels of the head (of which the arteries are mo st pain sensitive) \nare supplied preganglionarily from C8-Th13, via the stellate ganglion (vertebral \nartery) and via the superior cervical gang lion (internal and external carotid \nartery) \n\u2022 Visceral structures of the thorax or of the digestive system and their fascial \nconnections \nLiem (2001) lists the following techniques: CV4, atlanto-occi pital relaxation, treatment \nof the SSB, ease the tension of sutures, in tercranial dural relaxation techniques, \nrelaxation of neck muscl es and hyoidal muscles. \n According to Milne (1999) that craniosacra l techniques are highly recommendable for \nthe treatment of migraine. To him it is important, to  settle sphenoid, maxillae, \nmandible and upper cervical spine. In his poi nt of view, position and mobility of the \nmaxillae seem to decisive factors for tri ggering migraine and a hint why craniosacral \ntreatment plays such an important role in this respect.   According to a lecture held by Ligner (2008) it is of great  importance for the treatment \nof migraine to pay particular attention to the regions of C0-C1, C1-C2, C2-C3, as this \nis the area of the spine that  is responsible for good circulation. Especially C0-C1 is \nassociated with vasomotor disorders and t hus has got an influence on migraine. \nFurthermore it is important to him, to treat clavicle and C6 because of their influence \non arterial supply. In addition to that it is  crucial to pay attention to the venous \ndrainage of the cranium und to achieve t he relaxation of the cranial fascia. \nConcerning hormonal balance it is important to  pay attention to the position of occiput \nand temporalia and to relax t he tentorium, in order to br ing the sella turcica into a \ngood position. Also changes of the dura tensi on, due to previous traumata, can lead \nto headache and migraine, as they affect the nurturing function of the fascias. In \nregard of digestion, the osteopath shall give  the patient advice concerning nutrition \nand draw his attention to possible food intolerance, if necessary. \n - 20 - 2.7.11.1.2 Migraine in osteopathic publications \nTo Gallager (2005) it is particularly impor tant in case of migraine patients to \nnormalize mobility and muscle tone of the sp ine by means of soft tissue techniques \nbut also by means of manipul ation techniques. According to his experience, special \nattention has to be paid to the muscles in  the regions of neck and pericranium. As \nrisk factors and trigger factors differ from patient to pat ient, Gallager recommends a \ntrial-and error- approach.  \u201eOsteopathic ph ysicians with expertis e in holistic and \nmuscoloskeletal concepts are particularly well prepared to help\u201c (Gallagher 2005). \n From M\u00fcller\u2019s  (2007) point of view, ost eopathic manipulative techniques may have a \npositive effect on migraine. \u201eOsteopathic manipulative treatment may reduce pain \ninput into the trigeminal nucleus c audalis, favourably altering neuromuscular \nautonomic regulatory mechanism to reduc e discomfort from headache\u201c. As many \nfoodstuffs are a trigger factor  of migraine, for her this aspect also implies a probable \ntreatment approach. As additional supportive influence on the alleviation of migraine \nshe mentions relaxation exercises, biofeedback and yoga. It is striking that M\u00fcller, as \nan American osteopath, goes into very mu ch detail about the support of medical \ntreatment. \n \nEcker (2003) examines the effectiveness of  osteopathic treatment of migraine in \ncases in which menstruation was detected as being the trigger factor. In his study he \ncompares osteopathic tr eatment and medical treat ment and states: \u201eDie \nosteopathische ganzk\u00f6rperliche Vorgehenswe ise erzielte ohne Nebenwirkungen \ndeutliche Verbesserung, so dass wir daraus  folgern, dass die Osteopathie in der \nBehandlung und Begleitung der  menstruellen Migr\u00e4ne einen wertvollen Beitrag \nliefern kann\u201c. [The osteopathic, holistic practice achieved notable improvements \nwithout side effects, from which we draw the conclusion that osteopathy can make \nsignificant contributions concerning t he treatment of menstrual migraine.] \nUnfortunately no control group is  mentioned in this study and the number of 30 test \npersons is rather small.  Spannbauer (2008) examines the effectivene ss of osteopathic treatment on patients \nwho suffer from migraine wit hout aura by means of a so-called \u201cBlack Box Method\u201c. \nShe notices a positive influence on the conditi on of those patients that were treated. - 21 - \u201eThe considerable improvement in the conditions of the pat ients in their own opinions \nis a very rewarding outcome of this study \u201c. Unfortunately this study does not use a \ncontrol group either, as it is a within subject design study.  \n Van Tintelen (2002) works in his study wit h the aid of the Black-Box-Method, too. \nHowever, in his study he compares his resu lts with those of a c ontrol group that was \ntreated by \u201cgeneral or alternative practitioner s\u201c. He comes to the conclusion that an \nosteopathic treatment causes  a notable improvement concerning the frequency and \nintensity of migraine attacks and has, in additi on to that, a very positive influence on \nthe patients\u2019 well-being in general.  Loza (1998) deals in her study with the e ffectiveness of osteopathic treatment on \nmigraine patients as well as on headache pati ents. She notices a positive effect on \nboth groups, although better results could be achieved in case of headache patients. \nConcerning migraine patients she finds so me anomalies regarding certain regions: \nocciput, laterality of Atlas, C3, C7-Th1, la teral strain and torsion of SSB, temporal \nbone, digestive system  and genital system. \n \n2.8 The philosophy of osteopathy\n \nStarting from Still\u2019s principles Ligner  (1993) describes the fundamentals of \nosteopathy as follows (Ligner 1993, p. 22-24): \n\u2022 All life is movement: to evaluate mob ility is the prime crit erion in osteopathic \ndiagnosis. A restriction of mob ility means an osteopathic lesion. \n\u2022 Structure governs function and function fo rms structure: as soon as the ideal \nstate of harmony in the body is dist urbed the body does not operate optimally \nany longer. In turn, a malfunction in t he body may cause structural impairment. \n\u2022 The body is a unit: not the sum of all i ndividual parts makes a well-functioning \nwhole, but their interaction.  \n\u2022 The Law of the Artery: Life has to be nourished. Therefor e good circulation is \nof utmost importance. In osteopathy circ ulation refers to, besides the arterial \nand venous vascular system, all body fluids such as liquor, lymph and synovial \nfluids. Furthermore gas exchange, unrestricted transmission of nervous \nimpulses and the free circul ation of bodily and spirit ual energy are included. \n\u2022 Self-healing mechanisms: H ealth is the result of a number of self-regulatory \nprocesses of the immune system, the endocrine system, the autonomous \nnervous system and other regulatory systems.  - 22 - Osteopathy puts the holistic view of the human body at the cent er of its way of \ntreatment. For this reason I regard ost eopathy and its many different treatment \nmodels as an effective therapy  of migraine patients.  \n  \n3 Analysis of the individual interviews  \n3.1 Conduction of expert interviews (methodology)  \n3.1.1 The qualitative study  \nIn order to gain sufficient  information on the topic \u201costeopathic approaches to the \ntreatment of migraine\u201c, conducting a qualitative study seems to have many \nadvantages. Compared with a quant itative study, in a qualit ative study hypotheses \nare created, which are quite useful for inve stigations with only little information and \nwhich form the basis for further research work. Out of the many existing forms of \nqualitative interviews I chose the problem-c entered interview and decided to use it for \nthis paper at hand, in order to collect expert knowledge in a more targeted way. \nThese problem-centered interviews are particu larly useful when quite a lot is known \nabout the topic already and when precise, specific questions are to the fore (Mayring \n2002). Such an interview gives the interview ee the chance to speak rather freely and \nis thus very close to an open conversation. It is, however, focused on a certain topic \nor question, which is introduced by the in terviewer and to which he/she returns again \nand again throughout the interview (Mayri ng 2002). Therefore previous to the \ninterview a so-called interview-guideline is established, which is then used as a basis \nfor the conduction of the concrete interv iews. A further advantage of the usage of \nsuch guidelines is that they bring about a partial standardization of the interviews and \nthus the different interviews are compar able more easily. However, problems that \noccur at the conduction of such interviews are: \n\u2022 An accumulation of suggestive questions \n\u2022 Difficulties and a lack of patience when it comes to listening carefully or taking \nup ideas for further  questions \n\u2022 Unfreedom with the interview guideline resu lting from fear and insecurity (Flick \n2007) \n - 23 - 3.1.2 Interview guideline  \nThe central aspects of the interview gui deline were established on the basis of \nprevious literature research in order to analyze the topic more precisely. \nSubsequently this guideline was discussed with two osteopaths, to ma ke sure that it \ncontains the core points of migraine treatme nt. This guideline that was used in the \nexpert interviews can be looked up in the appendix of this paper. \nWhen compiling this guideline (cf. Appendix) I tried to sift out, how osteopaths deal \nwith the diagnosis migraine, whether their tr eatment of migraine patients differs from \ntheir treatment of other patients, how t heir approaches of treat ment look like and \nwhich techniques they use. Furthermore I tried to find out, how the osteopaths\u2018 \ninteraction with patients looks like and up to w hat extent they think osteopathy is an \nappropriate method of tr eatment of migraine. In the interviews I focused on facts \nrather than evaluating the p sychological background. I tried,  however, to interrupt the \ninterviewees\u2018 speech as rarely as possi ble. But, if necessary, I asked further \nquestions concerning a certain topic, in order to get more information about this \nspecific point. On the whol e the previously developed interview guideline proved to \nbe well-applicable during t he individual interviews. Thus no modifications between \nthe individual interviews were necessary.  \n \n3.1.3 Choice of osteopaths for my expert interviews  \nFor the choice of the experts intervie wed, I applied the following criteria: \n\u2022 A minimum of five years of practica l experience as osteopath with completed \nprofessional training \n\u2022 Osteopathic degree Msc or DO \n\u2022 Interviewees of either sex \n\u2022 A sample of osteopaths that work  with different treatment models \n\u2022 Active occupation in osteopathy (education, supervision, assistant) \nFurthermore I discussed my choice of ex perts with other osteopaths. First contact \nwas established by phone. I was surprised how spontaneously and cooperatively the \nselected osteopaths agreed to do the interviews.  - 24 - 3.1.4 Evaluation of my expert interviews  \nWith consent of the interviewees the inte rviews were recorded. Subsequently they \nwere transcribed and transferred to Standar d German, however, without correcting \nthe grammar. Thus the focus remai ned on theme and content  (Mayring 2002). \nAfterwards each interview was analyzed sepa rately. Thereby the gained material was \ncategorized and reduced in such a way that  the essential topics remained in the \nfocus without slipping into hasty quantificat ions.  As a result an image of the basic \nmaterial could be established. After that the most important  aspects of the individual \ninterviews were compared and a new categori zation with regard to the similarities of \nthe individual interviews was made.  \n3.2 Summary of the intervie w with expert M. (female)\n \nIn the following the interview with expert M. , which was conducted on the basis of the \ninterview guideline menti oned above, is summarized. \n \n3.2.1 Anamnesis and clinical examination  \n3.2.1.1 Anamnesis \nBasically M. always makes a very detailed protocol for every patient, in order to \ngrasp all facets of a patient. In case  of migraine patients she only asks more \nprecisely when, how, how often and sinc e when migraine attacks occur and whether \nthey are accompanied by an aura or not. Fu rthermore it is impor tant to her that \nmigraine patients are previous ly examined by conventional  medical practitioners, \nwhich is usually the case, as patients with this disease pattern normally have suffered from migraine long before attendi ng therapy. The aspect of posture and \nstress is of great import ance to her as well.  \nM.02:28-4: \u201eDie Belastungsfaktoren von Haltung und Stress, sind ein wesentlicher \nPunkt f\u00fcr mich.\u201c  [The strain factors of posture and stress are important aspects for \nme.] \nIn case of migraine patients she pays very  much attention to those aspects in \nanamnesis that deal with nutrition, allergie s, eyesight, teeth (occlusion), medication \nand hormonal problems, in order to be able to  draw conclusions concerning posture, \norgan strain and the like. Furthermore she a sks several questions regarding nutrition; - 25 - whether there are any food intolerances or not. In addition to that, digestion is of \ngreat importance to her, again in order to  draw conclusions concerning the organs. \nShe mentions the pelvic area as playing an important role  as well, however, without \ngoing into further detail regarding the reasons.  \nM.04:41-9: \u201eF\u00fcr mich ist bei  der Migr\u00e4ne eigentlich das Be cken ein sehr wesentlicher \nPunkt.\u201c [To me in case of migraine the pelvis is a very important point.] \nIn case of hormonally conditioned migrai ne she regards osteopathy as not very \nuseful, but leaves it open that other osteopaths probably have better experiences \nconcerning this matter.  \n3.2.1.2 Clinical examination \n By means of the biodynamic model she pays a ttention to the midli ne (there is a study \nconcerning midline by Monika Dunshirn) and  the cranial rhythm and thereby tries to \nfind out where in the body the problem is located. This examination is carried out \nmainly while the patient is s eated. Thereby security tests for the cervical spine and a \ncareful examination of the transitions C0-C1, C7-Th1, Th12-L1 and sacrum-coccyx \nare important to her, whereby she states that she does not find the coccygeal bone in \na malposition too often. In case of mi graine patients she does not detect muscular \ndysbalances and malpositions of cervical spine and upper thoracic  spine more often \nthan in other patients.   \n3.2.2 Migraine- a vascular, neurochemic, my ofascial, mental, structural, hormonal \nproblem?  \nM. states that in her opinion things always run parallel. It is har d to come across with \nany kind of categorization here, although she suspects that the reason for the \ndisease originates on a mental level, as  migraine often implies a hidden depression, \ntoo. When it comes to effects,  for her, the myofascial aspec t is of great importance.  \nM. 16:32-6: \u201eMyofascial auch aus dem Gr und, dass irgendwo im Strukturellen etwas \neinmal nicht ganz passt. Das hat Auswir kungen ja auch auf das Organsystem. Ja? \nUnd, ah, auch auf die nervale Versorgung, und somit schlie\u00dft sich der Kreis. Und es \nist eine Einheit, eins bewirkt das andere\u201d . [Myofascial for that reason, that \nsomewhere in the structure there is something wrong. Th is has effects on the organ - 26 - system. Yes? And, ahm, also on the nerval supply and this is where we\u2019ve come to \nfull circle. And it is a unit, one thing causes the other.] M. 16:53-5: \u201eUnd, ich glaube, dass halt bei manchen, der Ausl\u00f6ser, eher im, ahm,..., \nwie soll ich sagen, der mechanische Ausl\u00f6ser , eher im strukturellen Bereich war, der \ndann irgendwo, gut kompensiert schlummer t, und je mehr Ausl\u00f6ser dann, ah, \nzus\u00e4tzlich, oder Faktoren zus\u00e4tzlich daz u kommen, ist irgendwas  der Ausl\u00f6ser.\u201d \n[And, I think in some cases the trigger was rather, ahm\u2026, how shall I put it, the \nmechanic trigger was rather in a struct ural area, that doz es somewhere, well-\ncompensated and the more trigger, ahm, additi onally, or the more factors are added, \nsomething is the trigger then.] \nShe mentions particularly stress and nutri tion as additional trigger factors. \n \n3.2.3 Treatment techniques\n \nM. mainly works with the biodynamic model  when it comes to the treatment of \nmigraine patients. \n\u2022 50% biodynamic techniques \n\u2022 20% structural techniques \n\u2022 20% visceral techniques \n\u2022 10% cranial techniques  \nBy means of the biodynamics she particu larly aims at a good and well noticeable \nlongitudinal fluctuation, whic h is a sign of vitality according to the biodynamic model.  \nM. 19:53-6: \u201cJa? Wenn ich das erreichen kann , eine gut Mittellinie die zentriert ist \nund eine longitudinale Fluktuat ion, wenn ich es jetzt so pauschal und \u2026 dann geht es \nihnen eigentlich, auch auf der emotionalen Ebene, besser.\u201d [Yes? If I can achieve \nthat, a good midline that is centered and a longitudinal fluctuat ion, generally\u2026 then \nthey are feeling better on an emotional level as well.] \nShe applies structural techniques  mainly when there is seve re impairment, in order to \nprogress faster on the biodynamic level. However, it also depends on the patient, \nwhether she works structurally or biodynamic ally. But treatment does not differ from \nthe treatment of those patients that do not su ffer from migraine.  \nM. 25:45-2: \u201eWeil ich trotzdem immer der Meinung bin, wir behandeln, oder nicht der \nMeinung bin, das ist es ja im Prinzip,  behandeln ja den, Patienten, und ich muss \nschauen, dass er in all seinen Strukturen und Ebenen weitgehend frei ist, und das ist - 27 - eigentlich, wenn ich jetzt sage, egal mit welcher Symptomatik er kommt, es ist \neinfach Ausdruck seines, ah, Ungleichgew ichts. Wo sich das halt dann, auf Grund \nseines Mosaikbildes, darstellt. Aber prinzi piell geht es immer\u201d. [Because I\u2019m of the \nopinion that we treat, or I\u2019m not  of the opinion, that is it, basically, we treat the patient \nand I have to take care that he is free to a gr eat extent in all his structures and that is \nactually what I say, no matter with which symptoms he comes, it is simply the \nexpression of his imbalance. Where that comes to show, just like in a mosaic. But \nbasically it always works.] \nIn particular working on the pelvis and to balance out head and pelvis in terms of \ngood symmetry are highly important to her in the case of migraine patients. However, \nshe does not prefer any particular techni que, but decides individually for each and \nevery patient.   \n3.2.4 Treatment intervals\n \nM. treats migraine pati ents every three to six weeks. After some time, the intervals \nare lengthened to three to four months. It is important to her that the body has \nenough time to stabilize after the treatment.  \nM. 28:08-2: \u201eWeil gewisse Ver\u00e4nderungen nicht gleich u nd sofort eintreffen, ja. \nSondern  im Laufe von 3 bis 4 Wochen, ah, sich eigentlich eher, oder eigentlich erst \nzum Ausdruck kommen k\u00f6nnen.\u201c [Because some changes do not come to pass immediately, yes. But, ahm, t hey actually take effect only over the course of three to \nfour weeks.] \n \n3.2.5 Measures in addition to the osteopathic treatment\n \nEach patient is advised individually. If postu re is the cause, this aspect is discussed \nin detail. If stress is the pr oblem, she tries to find the bes t way of relaxation for this \npatient. Whether it is achieved by means of  music or rather by  means of exercise \ndepends on the patient\u2019s preferences. Furthermore she sometimes recommends \npsychotherapy to her patients as well, parti cularly when she is convinced that they \nwould not be able to come out of their probl ematic situations on their own. She also \nhas good experience with acupuncture and hom eopathy. If homeopathic treatment is - 28 - applied, e.g. for liver detoxic ation, she can feel during her next treatment that the \norgan has improved.  \nM. 31:46-6: \u201eDas kommt dann,..., nein, ic h glaube dass, das nicht so zu beantworten \nist. Denn es gibt,..., einfach f\u00fcr jeden Patienten so, den Sch\u00fcssel der passt. Bei dem Einen ist es  die Hom\u00f6opathie, beim An deren ist es eher das autogene Training, und \ndarum kann ich dass nicht sagen, dass ist wichtiger als das. Bei manchen ist \nAkupunktur.\u201c [\u2026 no I think that cannot be answered in any simple way, because \nthere is\u2026 for every patient there is a key that fits. For some it\u2019s homeopathy, for \nothers it is autogenic training a nd that\u2019s why I can\u2019t say this is more important than \nthat. For some it\u2019s also acupuncture.] \n \n3.2.6 Does the osteopathic treatment have a positive effect on migraine?\n \nM. 32:45-0: \u201eEs gibt einige wenige Au snahmen. Also ich habe einen Patienten, \nden,..., ja, bei dem hat das einf ach, nichts gebracht, ja. A ber ansonsten,..., sind die \nIntervalle, viel l\u00e4nger geworden, die M edikamente konnten zum Teil, reduziert \nwerden, zum Teil komplett abgebaut werden, al so,...ja\u201c. [There are a few exceptions. \nI had one patient who\u2026 where it helped nothing. But apart from that the intervals \ncould be lengthened and partly the medi cation could be reduced, or even \ndiscontinued, well\u2026 yes.] \nTo M. osteopathy is a very good option to  help migraine patients. She achieved \nremarkable successes by means of ost eopathy. Only in case of hormonally \nconditioned migraine she is not convinc ed of osteopathic treat ment. It is, however, \ndifficult for her to say, w hether the successes she achieves are lasting or not, as \npatients do usually not stay in touch with thei r therapist after therapy  is completed. M. \ndoes not think, however, that migraine disappears completely due to osteopathic \ntreatment, but that it has  positive influence on intensity, frequency and aura. Can \nosteopathy have any influence on the course of  the disease if therapy is started as \nsoon as the attacks set in? M. cannot say anything about that, as she is rarely ever consulted at this stage of the disease.   - 29 - 3.2.7 Interaction therapist - patient  \nM. is convinced that migraine patients do not recquire any special kind of interaction. \nShe always relies on her \u201csixth sense\u201d, no matter who the patient is and what he/she is suffering from. This is the reason why she sometimes decides not to treat certain \npatients. At the beginning she defi nes the goals of the treatment.  \nM. 35:51-4: \u201e\u201cWas m\u00f6chte ich erreichen, in  welchem Zeitrahmen, ja. Und, f\u00fcr mich \nsind so 3 bis 5 Behandlungen, wenn ich bis dahin, nicht irgendwo eine Ver\u00e4nderung \nsehe, oder der Patient auch nicht f\u00fcr si ch bemerken kann, dann h\u00f6re ich mit der \nTherapie auf. Dann finde ich nicht den Schl\u00fcsse l f\u00fcr das Schloss.\u201c [What do I want to \nachieve, in what time-span, yes. And for me that\u2019s three to five treatments, if I can\u2019t \nsee any changes until then, or if the pati ent doesn\u2019t notice any for himself, then I \ndecide to discontinue treatment. Because then I don\u2019t find the key to the lock.] \n \n3.3 Summary of the intervie w with expert S. (female)\n \nIn the following the interview with expert S ., which was conducted on the basis of the \ninterview guideline menti oned above, is summarized. \n \n3.3.1 Anamnesis and clinical examination  \n3.3.1.1 Anamnesis \nS. carries out the anamnesis of migraine patients in the same way she does with \nother patients. \nS. 02:35-3: \u201eAlso, grunds\u00e4tzlich so wie  in der normalen Osteopathischen- Anamnese \ninteressiert mich halt Alles, ja.\u201d [\u201cWell, basic ally everything is interesting for me, like in \nnormal osteopathic anamnesis.\u201d] \nIn this process she stresses the mechani cal aspect, looks for abnormalities in any \nstructure, asks for traumata, accidents or downfalls in the past and also surgeries \nthat have been carried under spinal or epidur al anesthesia.  She experienced that \nthose interventions stress the dural system very much and thus secondary tensions \noccur which cause headache and migraine-like symptoms. In expert  S.\u2019 opinion the \ndural system is a very import ant factor so she inquires tr auma situations precisely. \nS. 04:37-2: \u201eJa, da frage ich schon genauer nach. Also, das muss jetzt nicht \nunbedingt direkt am Kopf sein. Also es kann einfach im Laufe des ganzen - 30 - Duralsystems, sozusagen, irgendwo ein traumatisches Geschehen sein. Und beim \nKopf wei\u00df man es eben ganz genau, dass zum Beispiel, wenn auch Kinder, auf den \nKopf st\u00fcrzen, es immer wieder zu klei nst Blutungen auch kommen kann. Oder zu \nFixierungen, oder zu Spannungen in der Dura.\u201d [\u201cOf cour se I ask more specifically. It \ndoes not necessarily be at the head. Ther e can be a traumatic situation anywhere \nwithin the dural system. At the head you k now quite well what is going on, for \nexample regarding children that fall onto t he head, this can cause tiny bleedings \nevery now and then. Or it causes fixa tions or tensions within the dura.\u201d] \nTo her those fixations or tensions within t he dura as well as tensions in the bone are \na common reason for migraine. But someti mes one cannot tell what the source of \nmigraine is. In her opinion the most frequent cause is sciatica that comes from the \ntailbone, sacrum or the entire spine. \nS.  07:01-9: \u201eDiese mechanische Verbin dung, die dann eine Migr\u00e4ne ausl\u00f6st, die \nmechanische Spannung, ja. Das ist ei gentlich das H\u00e4ufigste was ich beobachten \nkann.\u201d [\u201cThis mechanical connection which caus es migraine, this mechanical tension. \nThat is what I observe most of the time.\u201d] \nFor S. it is a crucial point in anamnesis how  migraine lapses. Since what point of time \ndoes migraine occur, in which rhythm the pain appears and if there is a hormonal \ncoherence.  But also if a change in weat her of relaxing at the weekend trigger \nmigraine. \nS. 02:35-3: \u201eUnd dann ist sicherlich ganz wi chtig, dass die Patienten beschreiben wie \nsie auch abl\u00e4uft, ja. Und da gibt es wirk lich die unglaublichsten Formen der Migr\u00e4ne \neigentlich ja, also,..., vom klassischen Kopfschmerz mit \u00dcbelkeit, Erbrechen, \nLichtempfindlichkeit bis hin zu ,..., Ausstrahlungen in die Arme , in die Beine, oder im \nGesicht halbseitig. Also, Migr\u00e4ne hat wirklic h ein sehr vielf\u00e4ltiges Bild. Naja, und \nwenn man mal diese konkrete Bild hat\u201d. [\u201cIt is definitely that the patient describes how \nmigraine lapses. There are really unbelieva ble forms of migraine, well,..., the range \ngoes from classical headache with sickness, vomiting, light sensitivity up to,..., \nradiation to arms, legs or to half of the face. So, migraine is really many-faceted. \nWell, if you have once have this depict image of it.\u201d]     \nShe experienced that the migraine pati ents consulting her, have already been \nexamined by a conventional medical practitioner because they have already been \nsuffering for a long time. - 31 - S. 03:01-8: \u201eWeil, also der  Gro\u00dfteil der Patienten, sagen wir mal so, kommen durch \nuntersucht her. Und haben also die ganze Pale tte von R\u00f6ntgen, MRT, EEG, ah, alles \neigentlich schon hinter sich. \u201c [\u201cThe majority of the pat ients coming here have already \nbeen examined. They underwent X-ray,  MRI, EEG, and everything else.\u201d] \n \n3.3.1.2 Clinical examination \nWithin clinical examination s he investigates this mechanical connection by means of \na complete structural examination and l ooks for blockages. She also tests the \ncraniosacral rhythm according to the crani osacral model, examines the visceral area \nand often detects a limited mobility and motilit y of the liver. According to S., those \npatients mention dextral respective ly frontal headache within anamnesis. \nS. 08:57-4:  \u201eDas ist das Organ, das ic h am ehesten noch der Migr\u00e4ne zuordnen \nkann. Und, und, das auff\u00e4llig oft verspannt ist. Das sind aber doch Leute mit rechtseitigem Kopfschmerz, mit rechtsei tiger Migr\u00e4ne bzw. frontaler Migr\u00e4ne.\u201c \n[\u201cThat\u2019s the organ I can most likely associat e with migraine. And th at\u2019s the one that\u2019s \nsignificantly frequent tensed. But normall y it\u2019s only people with dextral headache, \ndextral migraine respective ly frontal migraine.\u201d] \nShe associates that with metabolism and detoxification induced migraine. Within \nanamnesis she often detects pat ients\u2019 hints like hepatitis or the frequent intake of \nmedicaments. Apart from struct ural examinations of the ce rvical spine, her clinical \nexamination also inclu des the examination of vessels in this area. \nS. 11:13-2: \u201eOb es irgendw elche Spannungen auf Gef\u00e4\u00dfe  gibt, die eventuell die \nDurchblutung oder die Physiologie im Kopf st\u00f6ren.\u201d [\u201cTo find ou t if there are any \ntensions on vessels which may disturb blood flow or physiology in the head.\u201d] \nThose tensions on vessels can have many different sources. \nS. 12:03-0: \u201eEs ist unterschiedlich. Also, es gibt sicherlich bei jeder Migr\u00e4ne, in der \nosteopathischen Erstuntersuchun g gibt es sicher immer einen totalen Hot Spot. Und \ndas ist unterschiedlich, das ist entweder das Fascien- System, bei dem Einen, beim \nAnderen ist es eher das Duralsystem, bei dem Dritten sind es  eventuell wirklich \neinmal grunds\u00e4tzlich vertebragene Ursachen. Also, Wirbelblockaden die \nSpannungen in der Muskulatur und im, eigentlich im ganzen System dann \nhervorrufen.\u201d [\u201cIt is quite va riable. Well, every type of migraine has always a defined \nhot spot, this becomes obvious within t he initial osteopathic ex amination. That\u2019s \nvarious, for one it\u2019s the fascial system, for another one it\u2019s the dural system and for a - 32 - third it might really be sciatica. Vertebr al blockages that cause tensions within \nmusculature and the entire system.\u201d]    \nShe does not detect more muscular imbalance s and malpositions of the cervical or \nthoracic spine regarding migraine pat ients compared to other patients. \nS. 14:45-0: \u201eNein. K\u00f6nnte ich nicht s agen. Also es gibt Patienten, die haben, \nWirbelblockaden und Verspannungen, der ersten G\u00fcte, und haben aber keine \nMigr\u00e4ne. Und dann gibt es also welche, die sind, ja, dort und da ein bisschen \nblockiert und haben aber eine ordentliche Migr\u00e4ne. Also, ist,..., nein, k\u00f6nnte ich \nkeinen direkt, also, es trit t oft gemeinsam auf, aber als prim\u00e4re H\u00e4ufung w\u00fcrde ich es \nnicht bezeichnen.\u201d [\u201cNo. I could not say tha t. There are patients wit h really horrible  \nvertebral blockages or tensions but without  migraine. And there are others who are \nonly a little bit blocked here and there but th ey do have rather severe migraine. So, \nno, I could not conclude, so, it often occurs together but I would not characterize it as \na primary cluster\u201d.]   \n \n3.3.2 Migraine \u2013 a vascular, neurochemic, my ofascial, mental, structural, hormonal \nproblem?  \nS. considers that every of those faciliti es is possible. It depends on the individual \nperson. Everybody has exper ienced different sensations  and pre-existing diseases \nincluding psychic aspects. \nS. 16:07-5: \u201eAlles. Es ist also, ich denke ohne Wertigkeit ist alles m\u00f6glich. Wichtig ist, \ndass man es eben von der Anamnese her genau abcheckt, und eben schaut, was hat er gehegt, wie f\u00fchlt er sich an. Bei de m Einen wird es vielleicht mehr vaskul\u00e4r \nsein, bei dem Anderen wird es  vielleicht mehr, durch In toxikation sein. Ja, egal. \u201c \n[\u201cEverything. It\u2019s, I suppose everything is possi ble without valuation. It\u2019s important to \ndo the anamnesis properly, check everything,  what did he or she is dealing with,  how \nis he or she feeling like. For one it is more a vascular problem, for another one it might be intoxication. Yes, does not matter.\u201d] \n \n3.3.3 Treatment techniques\n \nConcerning the treatment tec hniques it is very important for S. to handle migraine \npatients rather carefully. So she starts wo rking distal to the head. Especially in the - 33 - first therapy session since the system is already overexcited. Sometimes migraine \ncan be triggered during clinical  examination if one touches a cervical vertebra or the \nhead too harshly. This applies to structural as  well as cranial techniques. Primarily S. \ntries to relax the dura via the sacrum. If that is not work ing well she uses intraoral \ntechniques according to the biodynamic model and works via vomer and base of the skull at the dura.  S. learned that this rarely causes reactions.  S. 21:07-7: \u201eJa schon die Dura. Also di e Sch\u00e4delbasis, und damit eben die ganzen \nAufh\u00e4ngungen, der Falx, des Tentoriums  und dann weiterf\u00fchrend dann eben der \nDuralsack.\u201d [\u201cYes, the dura. I mean the bas e of the skull and in add ition to that the \nwhole suspension, the falx, the tent orium and further the dural sac.\u201d] \nWithin the dura there are m any blood vessels and so they are also effected by the \ntreatment. This is the vascula r element of her work. So to  say she tries to loosen the \nsystem from within and to achieve a relaxati on of the vessels.  Regarding structural \ntechiques, S. performs vertebr al manipulations. Also here she starts distal to the \nhead and handles especially anxious patients very carefully.  The treatment techniques performed split up in the following way: \n\u2022 40% structural \n\u2022 40% craniosacral + biodynamic (S. names this together) \n\u2022 20% visceral \nWithin the visceral model she oftentimes detects the liver as limited regarding its \nmobility. For the liver she uses biodynamic  as well as visceral techniques like for \nexample mobilization of the suspension of ligaments or the liver pump techniques. \nDepending on what the system shows. There is a certain technique from the \nbiodynamic sector which has a positive e ffect on migraine patients. While performing \nthis technique she works via the anterio r transverse septum according to the \nbiodynamic model. This treatment approac h is known from biodynamics. S. \nrecognized that this treatment approach wo rks very well with migraine patients. \nS. 26:12-7: \u201eGenau. Aus dem strukturellen Bereich eher  die Wirbelmanipulationen, \ndann halt auch, wie gesagt die Leber, wenn si e sich deutlich pr\u00e4sentiert. Dann die \nDura. Es gibt in der Biodynamik so Techni ken wo man dieses anteriore- transversale \nSeptum, dass sich ja zur\u00fcckzieht, schon re lativ bald nach Geburt. Also es ist eben \ndiese Haut, die das Gehirnwachstum st\u00fct zt. Frontallappen vom hinteren, also vom \nparietal Bereich, das zieht sich ja dann zur\u00fcck, hinterl\u00e4sst aber so kleine,..., \nBindegewebe. Und das ist zum Beispiel auc h relativ h\u00e4ufig der Fall, dass wei\u00df ich - 34 - aber erst, seit ich diesen, diese Tec hnik kennen gelernt habe, dass bei diesen \nAns\u00e4tzen, auch beim Erwachsenen, dieses  anterior- transversalen Septums, auch \nwenn es wahrscheinlich nicht mehr da ist, anatomisch, aber, dass es da schon \nSpannungen gibt, in Kombination auch mit de m Tendorium. Und das ist zum Beispiel \netwas was ich mir angew\u00f6hnt habe auch, bei Kindern und bei Erwachsenen, \u00fcber die \nL\u00f6sung dieser beiden Membranen zu  arbeiten. Und, das bringt sehr viel.\u201d [\u201cExactly. \nFrom the structural sector rather vertebral manipulation s, and, as already mentioned, \nthe liver where it\u2019s clearly recognizable.  And the dura. In biodynamics there are \ntechniques dealing with the anterior transvers e septum which retracts quite soon \nafter birth. So it is this skin supporting the cerebral growth. Frontal lobe form the rear, \nthe parietal area, retracts but leaves such li ttle parts of,...,conjunctive tissue. That is \nbeing the case quite often but I only discove red that while learni ng this technique and \nso I saw that the anterior transverse septum  is from an anatomical point of view not \nthere anymore but there are still tensions, al so in combination with the tentorium. And \nso I got used to work via the loosening of  those two membranes within the treatment \nof children as well as grown-ups. That is really working out.\u201d]  \n \n3.3.4 Treatment intervals  \nS. treats migraine patients onl y every four to six wee ks since many patients are \nalready overexcited and hence she does not w ant to work to intensely and to perform \ntoo many different techniques. These in tervals also do not disturb regeneration. \n \n3.3.5 Measures in addition to the osteopathic treatment  \nS. recommends traditional Chinese medici ne with acupuncture next to osteopathy. \nShe also trusts in Shiatsu and Ayurveda.   Homeopathy is appropriate when migraine \nis triggered due to hormones or  mental stress or diet. \nS. 33:04-4: \u201eAlso, in dem Moment, in dem die Migr\u00e4ne wirklich einen sehr hohen \nmechanischen- strukturellen Anteil hat, is t die Hom\u00f6opathie w ahrscheinlich nicht \nausreichend.\u201d [\u201cWell, when migraine has a large mechanic structural aspect, \nhomeopathy is not enough.\u201d] \nClassical massages or active training when  there are already tensions has a negative \nimpact on migraine. If stress is a trigger fo r migraine, she talks with the patient about - 35 - it, makes recommendations and counts on the patient\u2019s self-reliance (as she does \nwith mental health problems).  \n3.3.6 Does the osteopathic treatment have a positive effect on migraine?\n \nS. 35:45-9: \u201eJa. Absolut.\u201d  [\u201cYes. Absolutely.\u201d] \nAfter two to three therapy sessions the rate of the attacks considerably declines. It \nmight be possible that migraine vanishes. Bu t it is hard to track that since the \ntherapist often does not m eet the patient anymore. \n \n3.3.7 Interaction thearpist \u2013 patient  \nIt is important for S. mention that one has  to be very careful when examining and \ntreating migraine patients in or der not to cause migraine. Patients need a lot of rest, \nalso within therapy sessions. They should beco me aware of the factors that cause or \nstimulate migraine. \n S. 39:44-4: \u201eAlso, Aufmerksamkeit, dass man ihnen vielleicht klar macht, dass es \nzwar eine Krankheit ist, aber dass es ei nfach einen sehr hohen Anteil gibt, den sie \nselber auch dazu beitragen k\u00f6nnen. Und insofern, quasi, sind sie auch eben, bis zu dem sehr hohen Anteil selbst daf\u00fcr verant wortlich wie es ihnen geht.\u201d [\u201cWell, you \nhave to point out that it is a disease but that there are also  a lot of things they can do \non their own. This means, somehow they are responsible for how they are feeling to \na large extent.\u201d] S. 41:40-0: \u201eWas man vielleicht abschlie\u00df end sagen kann, oder soll, oder muss, ist, \nes gibt nat\u00fcrlich kein Kochrezept. Weder im Umgang, noch in der Behandlung. Ich \nglaube, die Osteopathie ist sicher ei ne der geeignetsten Me thoden, um Migr\u00e4ne \nerfolgreich behandeln zu k\u00f6nnen, weil sie ei nfach die M\u00f6glichkeit hat, den Patienten \ngenau zu zuh\u00f6ren. Verbal und auch das, was sein System bietet. Und wenn man das lesen kann, versteht was sich da tut, ja , also zumindest bis zu einem gewissen \nAnsatz, und darauf zugehen kann entsprechend, dann gibt es sicher eine M\u00f6glichkeit da was zu tun, therapeutisch. Das ist ei nfach der Vorteil den die Osteopathie hat. \nDeshalb glaube ich, dass es sicher, wie die Akupunktur auch, eine der geeignetsten \nM\u00f6glichkeiten \u00fcberhaupt ist, Migr\u00e4ne zu beh andeln.\u201d [\u201cFinally one can or even should \nstate that there is no recipe. Neither in dealing with it, nor within treatment. In my - 36 - opinion osteopathy is one of the most su itable approaches to treat migraine \nsuccessfully since it is possible for osteopaths  to listen to the patients very closely. \nVerbally and also to what his or her syst em is telling you. And if one can understand \nwhat is going on, at least to a certain point, and is able to react properly, then there is \nsurely a way for therapy. That is the advanta ge of osteopathy. This is why I believe it \nis, as well as acupuncture, one of the most su itable possibilities to treat migraine.\u201d]  \n3.4 Summary of the intervie w with expert B. (female)  \nIn the following the interview with expert B ., which was conducted on the basis of the \ninterview guideline menti oned above, is summarized. \n \n3.4.1 Anamnesis and clinical examination  \n3.4.1.1 Anamnesis \nB. asks those that patients who suffer from  migraine and that consult her about the \nexact course of their migraine.  Whether it is accompanied by nausea or diarrhea or if \ncirculation problems occur. She collects hint s that she analyses in more detail during \nthe subsequent clinical examinat ion. Furthermore it is im portant to her to find out \nwhether food is a trigger and if there is any histamine intolerance. In addition to that \nshe tries to find out if there were any injuri es of the coccyx in t he past and if due to \nsuch injuries there is a possible interre lation with migraine symptoms via fascias and \ndural tension. Furthermore she invest igates whether there is any hormonal \ninvolvement. If yes, she ex amines the urogenital area prec isely during the clinical \nexamination. Additionally s he tries to find out whether stress could be another trigger \nfactor as well and pay attention to the pati ent\u2019s eyesight; has it possibly declined or \nare the glasses no longer correct? Usually t he patients that come to see B. because \nof migraine have already been examined by conventional medical practitioners. \nHowever, in case of altered or new sym ptoms she advises them to see a doctor. \nB. 3:40-3: Ja, wenn es eine neue Art von Mi gr\u00e4ne w\u00e4re. Also wenn er sagt, ich hatte \nimmer die und die und die Migr\u00e4ne, aber jetzt kommt das und das dazu, dann w\u00fcrde ich ihn sofort zur weiteren Abkl \u00e4rung schicken. [Yes, if it was a new form of migraine. \nI mean, if he said I always had this and that  form of migraine and now something new \narises I would immediately te ll him to see a doctor again.]  \n - 37 - 3.4.1.2 Clinical examination \nDuring clinical examination she checks in the visceral model whether there are any \ntensions in liver or gallbladder and how m obility and density of t hese areas feel like. \nIn case of hormonally-conditioned migraine she examines the ur ogenital area (above \nall hypophysis, ovaries). Concerning the stru ctural level she pays close attention to \nspine, C0-C1, sacrum, pelvi s and coccyx. In regard of th e thoracic spine she checks \nmainly those areas that correspond to liver  and gall. Craniosacrally and structurally \nshe examines mandibular joint, sphenoid and SSB. \nB. 6:20-8: \u201cUnd in der Wirbel s\u00e4ule, also jetzt vom strukt urellen, besonders Kreuzbein, \nBecken, Stei\u00dfbein, C0, C1, eh klar. In der Wirbels\u00e4ule auch nat\u00fcrlich den Bereich \nder Leber, Galle pr\u00e4sentiert, in der Brust wirbels\u00e4ule. Also bei den Lendenwirbeln \nschau ich jetzt nicht besonders genau, sonder n grad nur so, dass ich wei\u00df, ist eine \ngr\u00f6bere Blockade, ja oder nein. Aber hoch zervikal sehr genau\u201d [And concerning the \nspine, from a structural part, especially pelvis, coccyx, C0, C1, of course. And of \ncourse also liver and gall, presented in t he thoracic spine. Regarding the lumbar \nvertebrae I don\u2019t look that closely, just  close enough to find out whether there is \nsevere blocking yes or no. But hi gher up cervically, very closely.] \nOn the craniosacral side especially the as pect of dural tension is particularly \nimportant to her. \nB. 6:40-7: \u201cUnd was vom krani o- Bereich noch wichtig ist, die ganze Dura Spannung. \nOb da vielleicht eine besondere S pannung von irgendwo ander s, eben von ganz \nunten oder irgendwo dazwischen kommt, die ei nen Einfluss hat.\u201d [And what is \nimportant in the cranio-field is the dural tens ion. Whether there is a specific tension, \ncoming from somewhere else, from the bottom up or from somewhere in between, \nthat has an influence.] \nFrom B.\u2018s point of view in the case of migraine patients, muscular dysbalances, \nmainly in the upper cervical area, are very striking; by all means more striking than in \nthe case of cervical-spine-patients. S he encounters the upper par t of the thoracic \nspine stiff either in extension or strong kyphosis.  \nB. 7:37-7: \u201eIch glaube, ich habe kaum ei nen Migr\u00e4nepatienten gebaht, der nicht hoch \ncervical oder in der oberen Brustwirbels \u00e4ule irrsinning steif und grad ist oder diese \nstarke Kyphose hat und damit ganz verpa cken ist. Und hoch cervical hat jeder \nirgendeine Verspannung.\u201c [I think I\u2019ve never faced any migr aine patient that wasn\u2019t or - 38 - still is extremely stiff, cervically or in t he upper thoracic spine or has this strong \nkyphosis. And further up cervically everyone has some sort of tension.] \n \n3.4.2 Migraine- a vascular, neurochemic, my ofascial, mental, structural, hormonal \nproblem?  \nB. is mostly inclined to the vascular aspect and thinks that the causes may very well \nbe found in another area, but t hat the effects surface mainly in the vascular area. \nHowever, the hormonal aspect is an important  one for her as well. According to her \nthe human psyche has no influence and she has  not experienced migraine patients \nto suffer from depressions more often than others do. \nB. 10:50-0: \u201cAlso vaskul\u00e4r ist es sicher. Aber warum die vaskul\u00e4ren Systeme da so \nreagieren, die Ursachen, die sind recht unt erschiedlich. Also hormonell ist sicher. \nAlso das wei\u00df ich, dass es sehr viele Mi gr\u00e4nen gibt, die hormonell kombiniert sind, \ngibt. Ich w\u00fcrde jetzt mal sagen, (Pause), neurochemisch ist f\u00fcr mich nur der \u00dcbertragungsmechanismus. Aber nat\u00fcrlich,  wenn man Gifte zu sich nimmt, oder \nmanche kriegen es nat\u00fcrlich \u00fcber irgendwelc he Nahrungsmittel, die auf die Nerven \nwirken. Ich glaube ich k\u00f6nnte zu jedem, habe ich ein, al les dabei. Aber letztendlich \nglaube ich schon, dass alle diese Dinge auf das vaskul\u00e4re System einwirken. Und dann, damit, widerspricht es sich f\u00fcr mich nicht, ob es hormonell oder vaskul\u00e4r ist.\u201d \n[Well, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s vascul ar. But why the vascular systems react like that has quite \ndifferent causes. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s horm onal, too. I know that there are many \nmigraines that are hormonally  combined. I would say (paus es) neurochemical is from \nmy point of view only the mechanism of trans mission.  But certainly, if you take in \ntoxins or some people consume them via cert ain foods that affect the nerves. I think I \ncould, everything is included. But in the end I think all these things affect the vascular \nsystem and from that point of view there is no contradiction whether it is vascular or \nhormonal.] \n \n3.4.3 Treatment techniques\n \nB. applies the following techniques: \n\u2022 33% structural \n\u2022 33% biodynamic and craniosacral - 39 - \u2022 33% visceral \nConcerning structural work she frequent ly applies muscle-energy-techniques and \nbalance-techniques, because, as menti oned above, she encounters strong muscle \ntensions in the area of C0-C1. Furthermore  she often finds muscular trigger points in \nthe sternocleidomastoid and the trapezoid muscl e. She tries to mobilize structural \nblockings of the coccyx and the pelvic ring. B. does not manipulate C0-C1, as for her \nmuscular problems play the central role. Ho wever, she manipulates the blockings of \nthe thoracic spine. \nB. 15:40-2: \u201eNein, aber es widerstrebt mir,  weil ich glaube, dass es sich durch die \nMuskeln, es ist nicht, durch eine Bewegung, sondern durch diesen Schmerz, verzieht \nes sich dort so. Und darum denke ich mir, l\u00f6se ich es sicher nicht mit Gewalt auf. \nAlso das widerspricht mir, widerstrebt mir.  Ich mein, wenn jetzt einer beim Autodrom \nfahren, und nachher hat er pl\u00f6tzlic h Kopfweh, dann w\u00fcrde ich ihn schon \nmanipulieren. Aber Migr\u00e4ne irgendwie\u201d  [No,  I\u2019m against that, because I think it\u2019s \nbecause of the muscles and not because of some sort movement, because of this \npain that it comes to shifts there. And I think, I certainl y won\u2019t loosen the blockings \nforcefully, I reject that. I mean if so mebody has a headache after a ride on the \nautodrom (some kind of leisure time motor-raci ng; translator\u2019s note), I would definitely \nmanipulate him. But in case of migraine.] \nConcerning the visceral field, she frequently resorts to the liver-pump technique, as \nthere is very often a congestion of the liver. However, if the hormonal aspect is in the \nforeground, she harmonizes alon g the hormonal axis. In case  of patients, who suffer \nfrom food intolerances, she treats the whole intestinal area employing the visceral \nmodel.  \nB. 17:07-9: \u201eAlso bei einigen Pati enten, wo es auch mit Nahrungsmittel \nUnvertr\u00e4glichkeit einhergeht, und das sp\u00fcrt man aber dann auch gleich. Da zieht es \ndich gleich zum Darm  hin, da behandle ich auch den Darm, und die ganzen \nVerklebungen. D\u00fcnndarm auf Dickdarm, und den  Dickdarm an sich, und diese, ja, \ndiese ganzen Veklebungen\u201d. [Well, in case of  patients where it is accompanied by \nfood intolerance, that\u2019s something you feel  immediately. Then it draws you to the \nintestinal area immediately and then I di rectly treat the bowel and all those \nadherences. Small bowel to large bowel and the large bowel itself and yes, all those \nadherences.] - 40 - For the treatment of the hormonal axis s he likes to resort to the biodynamic and \ncraniosacral model and furthermore those te chniques that affect the dural system. \nShe treats the SSB and tendorium by mean s of craniosacral techniques, if she \ndetects any tensions there. In addition to t hat she balances the sacrum if it is in a \nmalposition. In case ther e are problems concerning t he venous drainage from the \nhead and she can feel density in the thoracic  outlet area, she tries to relax the \ndiaphragm, in order to impr ove the permeability. Furthermore she aims at opening \nthe jugular foramen, at relaxing the superfici al cervical fascia and at treating clavicle, \nfirst rib and pectoralis minor. And finally she applies a sinus dr ainage using cranial \ntechniques according to the craniosacral model. B. starts her therapy of migraine pat ients away from the head and applies the \ntechniques rather carefully, in order not to  trigger anything. She only does what the \npatient really needs and uses only few techni ques; also in order to find out if and how \nthe patient responded to them.   \n3.4.4 Treatment intervals\n \nB. adjusts the treatment intervals to the techniques she uses during the first \ntreatment. If she works main ly structurally during the first session, she tells the \npatient to return after two weeks. In case  the patient has suffered from migraine for \nmany years already, the intervals are longer. If she is afraid of having stirred up \nsomething she tells the patient to re turn after only one week. On average the \nintervals are from two to five weeks. A fter about five treatments the interval can \nlengthen up to two months.   \n3.4.5 Measures in addition to the osteopathic treatment\n \nB. thinks that traditional Ch inese medicine and homeopathy are useful additional \nmeasures.Furthermore she thinks that Sh iatsu and Ayurveda treatments are helpful \nmeasures. \nB. 32:33-1: \u201e\u2026 damit diese Funktionskrei sl\u00e4ufe und diese Energiebahnen wieder \nnormal funktionieren.\u201d [\u2026 in order that thes e functional circuits and energy pathways \nrun normally again.] - 41 - She recommends nutrition counseling if food in tolerance is the cause. In case of \nmigraine triggered by stress, she advises  her patients to see a conversational \ntherapist. According to her infiltrations in to the sub occipital area have a negative \ninfluence on the osteopathic treatment, because it is difficult for her to work with \nmuscle and fascial techniques in  this area in that case.  \n \n3.4.6 Does the osteopathic treatment have a positive effect on migraine?  \nB. is sure that osteopathy can successf ully treat migraine and even achieve its \ndisappearance. However, she also experie nced that the osteopathic treatment turns \nout to be inefficient. According to her this is the case when pati ents are not ready for \ncollaboration.  \nB. 35:03-7: \u201cIch habe auch erlebt, dass es ganz weg ist. Vor allem bei Jugendlichen \nund Kindern. Bei Erwachsenen die Frequenz deutlich reduziert  wird. Aber ich habe \nauch schon erlebt, dass \u00fcberhaupt nichts geholfen hat. Das habe ich auch schon erlebt.\u201d [I witnessed cases where it to tally disappeared. Especially adolescents and \nchildren. Regarding adults usually a significant decrease of frequency can be \nachieved. But I\u2019ve also experienced cases where it did not help at all. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve \nexperienced as well.] \n \n3.4.7 Interaction therapist-patient\n \nB. thinks that migraine patients demand a spec ial form of interaction, because the \ntherapist depends on his/her patients\u2018 collabo ration in such cases, for example if \npatients have to make dietary changes or if  they have to do something against their \nfeeling of stress. To B. it is particularly important to explain her  patients exactly what \nshe is doing and how all factors interdepend and interact in order to motivate them.  \n \n3.5 Summary of the interv iew with expert A. (male)  \nIn the following the interview with expert B ., which was conducted on the basis of the \ninterview guideline menti oned above, is summarized. \n - 42 - 3.5.1 Anamnesis and clinical examination  \nFor A. it is important that patients are examined by a conventional medical \npractitioner beforehand. Otherwise he does not  treat them, as he lacks necessary \nand important information. He regards hims elf as being one part of a bigger network. \nA. 1:45-5: \u201e Wenn sie nicht schulmedizinisch abgekl\u00e4 rt sind, w\u00fcrde ich sie auch nicht \nnehmen, weil, ich brauche Informationen un d das ist wichtig f\u00fcr den Osteopathen. \nWir sind ein Teil eines Netzwerkes, und w enn zu mir ein Patient kommt, sagt, nein \nich war noch nicht beim Arzt, w\u00fcrde ich ihn auch nicht nehmen, weil die Migr\u00e4ne ist, \nunter Anf\u00fchrungszeichen Migr\u00e4ne,  ein sehr komplexes Bild.\u201c [I would not treat them, \nif they didn\u2019t see a conv entional medical practitioner and had not done all necessary \ninvestigations before, bec ause I need information and that is important for an \nosteopath. We are part of a bigger network  and if a patient came and said, no I \nhaven\u2019t seen a doctor yet, I would not take him, because migraine, migraine in \ninverted commas, is a very complex picture.] \nIf the patient has been examined by a conv entional medical prac titioner beforehand, \nhe asks in anamnesis precisely how often and since when the patient has suffered \nmigraine attacks and if the patient can reme mber when they occurred for the first \ntime, if that was before or a fter puberty and if he can think of  any specific trigger that \ncaused the disease. \n A. conducts a short neurological test, whic h implies a sensibility test and has a look \nwhether nystagmus occurs. Furthermore he checks the patient\u2019s tooth-position as \nwell as the mobility of the upper and lower ce rvical spine.  He asks the patient if \nhe/she suffers from defective vision, che cks the function of the eye muscle and asks \nthe patient if he/she suffers from chronic sinusitis at t he moment or if he has ever \nsuffered from it. Furthermore he asks whet her he/she had an operation of the nasal \nseptum and if he/she is prone to infections  of the middle ear. In addition to that he \ntries to find out all about the traumata that have occurred si nce the patient\u2019s birth and \nif the patient has any information about his/her  own birth. As distinct from patients \nwho suffer from headache or cervical spine di sorders, A. always detects malpositions \nor muscular dysbalances in cervical spine and upper thoracic spine in case of migraine patients . \nA. 3:32-2: \u201eAlle. Ausnahmslos, alle.\u201c [All. All without exception.] \n - 43 - 3.5.2 Migraine- a vascular, neurochemic, my ofascial, mental, structural, hormonal \nproblem?  \nFor A. the vascular aspect plays the most  prominent role. He assumes that a \n\u201cderailment\u201d of the system is  the cause for migraine and lo oks for combinations that \nallow conclusions concerning the reasons for this derailment. \nA. 4:44-2: Eine Ursache kann zehn Au swirkungen haben. Eine Auswirkung zehn \nUrsachen. Ja, ich glaube n\u00e4mlich nicht an irgendeine Struktur. Weil so was gibt es \nnicht, leider. Denn sonst w\u00e4re es ja f\u00fc r uns und die Mediziner die Sache ganz \neinfach. Also ich sehe we lche Kombinationen sich da aufgebaut haben, die zu einem \nMigr\u00e4ne Fall gef\u00fchrt haben. Also, man beginnt mit der Struktur, dann schaut man die \nkn\u00f6cherne Struktur, im Ve rgleich zum Hirn bzw. zum Duralsystem. Dann das \nDuralsystem, inkludierend das ven\u00f6se System bzw. Sinuse.\u201c   [One cause can have \nten effects, and one effect ten causes. Yes,  because I don\u2019t believe  in one structure, \nunfortunately something like that does not exist. Otherwis e everything would be so \neasy for us and the physicians. Well, I see combinations that have established and \nthat have led to migraine. You start with th e structure, then you take a look at the \nbony structure, as compared to brain or the dural system, respectively. An then you \nturn to the dural system, in cluding the venous system and the sinuses, respectively.] \nA. thinks that there are some forms of mi graine that are caused by a vasculitis. In \nsuch cases he closely collaborates  with conventional physicians.  \nAs a next step he tries to find out which i nner organs affect the system or can evoke \na membranous reaction via the autonomic nervous system, respectively. He regards extreme dysfunctions \u2013 intratentorial and underneath the tentoriu m cerebella- as a \nfurther important factor in the case of  migraine patients. He detects massive \ncompressions in the area C0, C1, C2 and in the area of the sinuses, which are caused by development and growth. Again this  is a matter of combinations that have \nestablished over the course of time. He  looks for causes and effects and thereby \nfollows an order that arises fr om his osteopathic viewpoint. \nConcerning the visceral ar ea, A. frequently encounters a dysfunction in the upper \nabdomen. Very often he detects abnormities in  liver and gall, but sometimes also in \nthe duodenum. A. 8:13-5: \u201eDuodenum ist f\u00fcr mich noch ein sehr  wichtiges Organ. Wir wissen, dass \nrelativ viele Stoffwechselzonen vorhanden sind, im Duodenum. Und da kann auch \neine massive Dysfunktion stattfinden. Und die Synchronisati on im Bereich des - 44 - Stoffwechsels ist deutlich sp\u00fcrbar. Also, Dudenum w\u00fcrde ich nicht vernachl\u00e4ssigen\u201c \n[The duodenum is another import ant organ for me. We know that it contains several \nmetabolic zones. Massive dysfunctions can occur there. And the synchronization in \nthe metabolic areas is clearly percept ible. I would not neglect the duodenum.]  \nStress may be one of the causes, too. \n3.5.3 Treatment techniques  \nA. applies the biodynamic model 100%. \nA. 10:37-7: \u201ees ist f\u00fcr mich die Technik, wo man nur beobachten muss, wie sich der \nK\u00f6rper reguliert. Die Diagnose ist viel pr\u00e4zis er, die Differenzierung ist viel pr\u00e4ziser. \nUnd selbstverst\u00e4ndlich, der K\u00f6rper freut sich sehr, wenn er selbst arbeiten darf, \nsozusagen, und wenn nicht in einer oder anderen Art manipuliert wird.\u201c [For me it is a technique where you just have to observe how the body regulates itself. Diagnosis is much more precise, diffe rentiation is more prec ise. And of course \nthe body is happy, when it can work by itse lf and is not manipulated in one or the \nother way.]  \nIn A.\u2018s opinion the biodynamic model gi ves precise information about the patient\u2019s \ncondition. From his point of view it is not possible to talk about \u201ctechniques\u201d in regard \nof the biodynamic model. He thinks that by means of biodynamics he is able to \ncarefully follow each level step by step and layer by layer and thus is able to establish a more precise diagnosis. Like that  he can clearly differentiate in terms of \ncauses and effects. A. 12:09-8: \u201e Also Techniken aus dem biodynamischen Bereich, das ist einmal falsch \nausgedr\u00fcckt. Es gibt keine Techniken. Es gibt einfach die biodynamische \nOsteopathie. Techniken gibt es nicht. Das hei\u00dft, w\u00e4hrenddessen ich, ich kann sehr deutlich differenzieren. Also ist es, in ei nem, also diese Komb ination eine Ursache \nzehn Auswirkungen, eine Wirkung, zehn Ursa chen.\u201c [Biodynamic techniques is a \nwrong expression. There are no techniques. There is just biodynamic osteopathy. No \ntechniques. That means, during that process I can differentiate very clearly. That \nmeans it\u2019s one, I mean this combinati on one cause ten effects, one effect ten \ncauses.]  \nIn addition to that he also investigates the fluid and lymph area as well as the visceral \narea and feels vitality and quality of the syste m. These are the par ameters that give \nhim indication of the patient\u2019s condition. He  re-examines these areas in every session - 45 - and makes notes about every single investigat ion. For A. it is important that \nconcerning quality the patient makes great leaps forward from session to session. \nA. 12:37-2: \u201eAlso es geht immer um die Qualit \u00e4t\u201c [Well, it\u2019s all about quality.]  \nIn his opinion a reaction is desirable after a treatment according to the biodynamic \nsystem. A. 13:43-5: \u201e Es ist so. Wenn man die Biodynamik  gut verstanden hat, ja. Man kann ja \nnur erwarten, dass eine Reaktion nach der  Behandlung stattfindet. Das hei\u00dft, der \nPatient besitzt noch eine Reaktionsf\u00e4higkei t. Also, eine Erstverschlimmerung, das ist \nselbstverst\u00e4ndlich. Die soll auch statt finden, in irgendeiner  Form. Und das wird dem \nPatienten erkl\u00e4rt und gesagt, bitte wir erwa rten eine Reaktion, ich hoffe sie kommt. \nDas hei\u00dft, dann hat der K\u00f6rper die Kapazit\u00e4t  aus seinem alten Muster heraus zu \nkommen, und wieder in Richtung Besserung sich bewegen. Richtung, in die \nGesundheitsebene hinein zu kommen, zu  einer Stabilisation, zu einer \nSynchronisation der Systeme.\u201c [It\u2018s li ke that. If one has really understood \nbiodynamics, yes. One can only wait for a r eaction to occur after the treatment. That \nmeans that the patient still has got the ab ility to respond. An initial exacerbation, \nthat\u2019s natural. That should happen in some way. And y ou explain the patient, ok, \nplease, we are waiting for a reaction, I hope it will occur.  That means the body has \nthe capacity to come out of its old pattern  and move towards improvement, towards a \nhealthier level, towards stabilization and a synchronization of the systems.] \n \n3.5.4 Treatment intervals\n \nA. treats his migraine patient s every three to four weeks, whereby it is always \nimportant to him that hi s patients make qualitative leaps forwards. These are \nindicators for him when the nex t treatment shall be scheduled. \n \n3.5.5 Measures in addition to the osteopathic treatment  \nFor A. the most important additional reco mmendation for patients with migraine is \nbreathing exercise, because this leads to an improvement of the tissue\u2019s supply with \noxygen. Furthermore he thinks t hat singing is helpful, as it brings vibration into the \nsystem. - 46 - A. 17:10-8: \u201eVibrationen, mobilisiert das ganz e Lymphsystem, mobilisiert die \nStimmung.\u201c [Vibrations mobilze the whol e lymph system and raises spirits.]  \nA. experienced, too, that p sychic strain has a negative influence on migraine, as it \ncan trigger attacks. However, he could not detect that migraine patients suffer from \ndepressions more than other patients do. \n \n3.5.6 Does the osteopathic treatment have a positive effect on migraine?  \nA. 20:04-5: \u201e Ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja\u201c [Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.]  \nA. found out that some patients even became totally free of complaints after being \ntreated by means of the biodynamic system. A. 20:31-6: \u201e Also aus meiner Praxis kann ich sagen,  sind wirklich Patienten, die nie \nwieder Migr\u00e4ne hatten. Aber die haben hart gearbeitet von ein bis zu eineinhalb \nJahren \u201d [From my experience in practice I can say there are really patients who have \nnever suffered an attack anymore. But they wo rked really hard for it, from one to one \nand a half years.] \n \n3.5.7 Interaction therapist - patient\n \nTo A. the interaction between therapist and patient is of gr eat importance. In case of \nmigraine patients one has to be especially mindful and to care for body, mind and \nsoul. One has to pay very much attention to  what the patient sa ys, as those things \nare important hints for the individual advice th e therapist gives.  \nA. 22:07-9: \u201eUnd man muss immer sc hauen, und schauen, welche Ebene Vorrang \nhat. Sei es die k\u00f6rperliche, die seelisch e oder die geistige Ebene. Und dann wei\u00df \nman, wenn man biodynamisch arbeitet, auch wo ist der Schwerpunkt in der Therapie \nin diesem Fall\u201c [And one has to look carefu lly, which are the le vels that are most \nprominent at a time. Be it the bodily, the emot ional or the spiritual level. And then, if \nyou work with biodynamics, you know where the focus in therapy has to be placed \non.] \n - 47 - 3.6 Summary with the expert P. (male)   \nIn the following the interview with expert P.  which was conducted on the basis of the \ninterview guideline mentioned above, is summarized.  \n3.6.1 Anamnesis and clinical examation  \n3.6.1.1 Anamnesis \nDuring anamnesis gathers exact data concer ing the course of migraine. When, \nwhereby and how it started. Which pattern  it shows. Thereby he does not consider \ntrigger factors very important. P. thinks that  in case of 40% of patients it is not \nobvious what triggers it. If any, P. consi ders the hormonal system or stress a trigger \nfactor. He doesn\u2019t encounter nutrition a tr igger. The patients which see him have \nbeen well examined by a conventional medical pr actitioner due to their long course of \ntreatment.   \n3.6.1.2 Clinical examination \nDuring the clinical examination P. consider s it important to c heck the patient from \nhead to toe.  P. 2:53-1: \u201eEinmal rauf und runter und einmal alles durch\u201c[One time up and down and \none time thoroughly]  \nHe dedicates special attention to the pelvi c area and thereby above all to the sacrum. \nP. 2:13-7: \u201eKreuzbein ist das allerwichtigste\u201c [The sacrum is most important.] \nIn case of migraine patients, he consider s the approach to examine the patient from \nhead to toe very important. In case of  a headache he examines the area where the \npain is situated, more locally. P. does not think that migraine patients have more \nmalposition or muscular dysbalances of the ce rvical spine or the upper thoracic spine \nthan other patients.  \n3.6.2 Migraine \u2013 a vascular, neurochemic, my ofascial, mental, structural, hormonal \nproblem?   \nP. considers migraine a mixture of diffe rent causes. He uses a good example to \ndescribe this system in which al l things influence each other:  \nP. 05:07-0: \u201eZum Beispiel eine verdrehtes Kreuzbein, das einen Zug auf die \nGehirnh\u00e4ute aus\u00fcbt. Durch die falsche St atik, Blockaden kreuzen quer durch die - 48 - Wirbels\u00e4ule. Irgendwann hervorgerufene Bl ockaden von ersten Rippen, die dann den \nganzen Tonus in der Halswirbels\u00e4ule verschlechtern. Die Mechanik der Halswirbels\u00e4ule verschlechtert, dadurch ei ne verschlechterte Gehirndurchblutung, \nplus irgendwelche seien es toxi sche \u00dcberspannungen in Gehirnh\u00e4uten. \nIrgendwelche traumatischen Blockaden von Sch\u00e4deln\u00e4hten, da kommt ein System \naufs andere drauf. Ich hab das Gef\u00fchl, dass m an wirklich erst im Nachhinein, wenn \nes den Patienten sehr viel besser geht, dass, es quasi dann den einen Tropfen gibt, \nder das Fass zum \u00fcberlaufen bringt. Wo dann Frauen beim Zyklus pl\u00f6tzlich, kippt \ndas System, weil es eben hormonelle Schw ankungen gibt. Und dadurch kommt die \nMigr\u00e4ne. Die k\u00e4me gar nicht, wenn eben diese ganzen L\u00e4sionen nicht da w\u00e4ren.\u201c \n[For example a distorted sacrum which put s a strain on the cerebral membranes. \nBecause of faulty statics, blockades traver se across the spine. Blockades of the first \nribs once evoked, which then pejorate the to nus of the cervical spine. The mechanic \nof the cervical spine worsens, thereby the bl ood flow in the brain is worsens, plus be \nit some toxic surge of t he cerebral membranes.  \nSome traumatic blockades of cranial su tures, then one system follow the other. I \nthink that only afterwards,wen the patient feel s a lot better, that th ere is a last straw \nthat breaks the camels back. In the case  of women during the cylce suddenly, the \nsystems tips over, because there are hormona l oscillations. And thus the migraine \nstarts. It would not start if it  wasn\u2019t for all these lesions.]  \n3.6.3 Treatment technique\n \nP. uses structural, biodynamic, cranciosacr al and visceral techniques to the same \nextent while working with migraine pati ents. He does not specify a certain \npercentage. His personal concept consits in det ermining the treatment in two to three \ntherapy sessions. In every session he proceeds as follows:  1. Therapy session: During the first therapy  session P. works structurally on the \npelvis, whereby the sacrum is of great importance to him.  \nP. 06:36-7: \u201e Vorlauf Test, Beinl\u00e4ngen Test, sc hau mir mal das ganze Becken an. \nHabe eine extreme Kreuzbein Affinit\u00e4t, da ko mmt fast keiner raus, ohne dass ich am \nKreuzbein irgendwas mache.\u201c [F orerun test, leg length test , I take a look at the \npelvis. I have a real affinity to the sa crum, next to noone gets away with me doing \nnothing on the sacrum]\n - 49 - He cannot find a specific pattern of lesions for the position of the sacrum in case of \nmigraine patients. P. diagnoses  the pattern of lesions of the sacrum via the fascial \nsystem with the aid of respiration.  P. 7:21-0: \u201e.Also, einatmen, ausatmen lassen. U nd so wie das Kreuzbein fascial in \nder Ausatmungsphase hinein, sich dreht, das verwende ich quasi zu Grunde liegend, \nf\u00fcr die Korrektur. Und seither habe ic h die stabilsten Befunde im Gegensatz zu \nVorlauf Test und Sulcus und Angulus und hin und her. Also, seitdem ich das nur \nnoch fascial teste, habe ich das Gef\u00fchl, ist es wirklich eine eindeutigere Aussage.\u201c \n[Letting them breathe in, breathe out. And just  as the sacrum turns fascially during \nthe phase of respiratio, this is what I use as a basis fort he correction. And since then \nI have the most stable findings, contrary to  forerun test and sulcus and angulus and \nso on. Since I limit myself to fascial te st, I have the feeling of gaining a more \nunambiguous information.]  \nFor correction he likes to use Mitchell-techniques.  \nP. 05:18-3: \u201e Also ich hab das Gef\u00fchl, dass die, dass seitdem ich das Becken mit \ninvolviere und extrem viel Arbeit am Kr euzbein mache, dass es seither ein extrem \nhoher Prozentsatz von Langzeit-Migr\u00e4ne- Patienten ist, denen es wirklich besser \ngeht.\u201c[I have the feeling t hat there is an extremely high percentage of long-term \nmigraine patients who feel much better, si nce I started involving the pelvis and do a \nlot of work on the sacrum.] \nFurthermore, in the first session the entir e abdominal area and the diaphragm. But he \ndid not observe a certain abdominal organ being affected more frequently. He treats \nwhat he finds. At the end t he biodynamic model result s in a basic adjustment.  \n2. Therapy session: During this therapy sessi on P. tests the entire spine structurally, \nstarting at the coccyx up to head and loses bl ockades he finds. On lumbar spine P. \nworks with lumbar-roll- and contract-release- techniques. On the throracic spine P. \noften manipulates, and losens the blockade s of the cervical spine with functional \nmobilisations, tries to reach the point of release until it reopens. According to P., in \ncase of migraine patients the first ribs are blocked nearly 100%. The patients feel \nimmediate relief when the first rib becomes unblocked (e.g. using Mitchell-techniques \nand the cervical spine is functionally mobilize d. He considers the blocking of the atlas \nas compensation, due to the mal position of the first rib.  \nAt the end of this session he works cranios acrally applying the craniosacral model.  - 50 - P. 9:58-0: \u201eDa mache ich dann eine Dura-Rebalanci ng am Schluss, aus der Kranio \nquasi dieses Synchronisieren von O cciput  und Sakrum, und das sch\u00f6n zu \nintegrieren.\u201c [At the end I\u2019m rebalancing the dura, from the cranio, effectively the \nsynchronisation of occiput and sacrum, in order to ingetrate it nicely.] \n3. Therapy session: In most cases the firs t two sessions are suffi cient. If not, a third \ntherapy session is carried out. During this  sesion P. works nearly exclusively \naccording to the craniosacral model. He st art with a cranio-structural approach, tests \nthe mobility of each skull bone, loses the sutu res, proceeds to the level of fluids and \nthen works mainly on the cerbral membranes. He concludes the therapy session biodynamically, in order to integrate everything.  P. 11:34-6: \u201eIm Grunde ist die Motivation das Syst em so gut wie irgend m\u00f6glich auf \ndie Beine zu stellen, und das von Kopf bis Fu\u00df\u201c  [It\u2019s basically the motivation to set up \nthe system as good as possible, from head to toe] \n \nP. does not treat migraine patients more  cautiously than other patients. The \nosteopathic treatment can caus e a reaction in the patient and trigger and additional \nmigraine attack. Previously to the treatment he explains to the pati ent that a reaction \nmight occur, normally the patients agree.  \n3.6.4 Treatment intervals\n \nIn case of P. the interval of treatments is about five to six weeks. In case of long-term \nmigraine patients, it is six to eight weeks.  Normally he treats them two to three times.  \n3.6.5 Measures in addition to the osteopathic treatment  \nP. considers it important for his patients to do sports respectively weight training in \nthe gym, in order to work on their pos ture and a stable circulaion. Additonally, \nendurance training would be good.  He advises the patients to drink a lot and take \nmulitvitamine supplements, in order to cover possible deficites of nutrition. Referring \nto stress and relaxation, P. says:  P. 18:17-9: \u201eAlso f\u00fcr mich ist es wichtiger, da ss ich sie schmerzfrei bekomme oder \ndie Ursache finde. Damit die dann in ei n ruhigeres Leben hinein kommt, weil dann \nein gro\u00dfer Stress weg f\u00e4llt, und dann kommt sie ein bisschen mehr zur Ruhe.\u201c[For \nme it is more important to relieve them of  pain or find the cause.  In order to make - 51 - them have a calmer live, because a big stress disappears and they gain a little more \npeace.] \nP. sees negative effects on the osteopathi c treatements if pat ients resort to \naccupuncture simultaneously or attend the ch iropractor. He prefers working with one \nsystem only. According to him, treatment becomes difficult, in  case of medical intake  \nand when patients start with the reduction of the drugs. This makes it hard for him to \ncontrol the system.  \n \n3.6.6 Does the osteopathic treatment have a positive effect on migraine?   \nP. made the experience, that most migraine patients are fr ee of complaints after two \nto three therapy sessions. In some case s a periodically occu ring headache remains. \nBut not in the form of the migraine attacks the patient had before. In rare cases he \ncan only achieve that the attacks become less frequent and less intense. However, \nso far he did not have a patient, in whose case he didn\u2019t have any success with this approach. P. ask the patients for an anual follow-up check.  \nP. 14:04-1: \u201eIch mach ganz gerne so Check- up\u00b4 s. Jedes Jahr einmal. Wobei am \nAnfang, wenn wir so ultra Langzeitpatienten haben, mit vi elen Therapien, dann sag \nich meistens, kommen sie nach sechs Monaten wieder, und dann erst 3/4 Jahr und \ndann ein Jahr und dann zieht man das so ausei nander.\u201c[I like doing these check-ups. \nEvery year. However, at the start, when we have these r eally long-term patients with \nmany therapy session, I say, come back in six months and then three quarters of a year later and then one year and you lenghten the intervals.] \n \n3.6.7 Interaction therapist \u2013 patient\n  \nP. thinks that migraine patients should not be pitied to much, in order not to push \nthem in to the role of the poor. It is be tter to encourage them to take the improvement \nrespectively the healing of their migraine in their own hands, with the help of the \ntherapist.  P. 20:33-5: \u201e Also indem ich versuche sie wegzuf\u00fchr en, ich bin ein armes, siechendes \nHascherl, ja, sondern, ich sage, ok, und je tzt einmal Vollgas. Das man ihnen erkl\u00e4rt, \nok, ich kann ihnen was anbieten. Wir haben Stra tegien, machen wir was\u201c[By trying to \nlead them away from, I\u2019m a poor, sick thing, yes, instead I say, alright, and now at full - 52 - throttle. Explaining them, right, I can offer you something. We have strategies, let\u2019s \ngo] \nP. has not experienced migraine patients su ffering from depression s more frequently \nthan others.   \n3.7 Summary of the intervie w with expert R. (female)\n \nIn the following the interview with expert R.  which was conducted on the basis of the \ninterview guideline mentioned above, is summarized.  \n \n3.7.1 Anamnesis and clinical examation  \n3.7.1.1 Anamnesis \nR. considers it important to ask in anam nesis: 1) Since when do the patients suffer \nfrom migraine, how often it occurs, whet her it is accompanied by an aura, and \nwhether vomiting is a factor of  migraine. 2) For her it is important whether there is a \ngenetic background, i.e. whether  migraine occurs frequently within the family. 3) The \nthird question about the trigger of migraine is especially im portant for her. Are there \nconnections, e.g. intolerance of certain f ood, or do patients react with migraine to \nchanges of the weather, whether there were ce rtain traumata over the course of their \nlife, how the trauma was tri ggered and whether the migraine st arted at this specific \nmoment. This is important to her, becaus e falling on the head or the back could have \nincreased the tension of the dura, and because of this dural problem the vascular \nsystem of the head can be affected. A neurochem ic disorder which also affects the \nvascular system could be another reason.  R. 27:50-1: \u201eAber Dura Spannung ist ein ganz ein wichtiger Faktor bei Migr\u00e4ne \nPatienten.\u201c [Dural tension is a very import ant factor in case of migraine patients.]  \nThe migraine patients attending R.\u2019s sur gery have been previously examined by a \nconventional medical practitioner.  R. 1:50-7: \u201eSie kommen zu mir, weil sie Migr\u00e4ne haben. Die Patienten haben schon \nJahre lang Migr\u00e4ne und nicht erst seit einem Monat. Und, haben das sicher schon \nabgekl\u00e4rt.\u201c[They come see me, because they suffer from migraine. The patients have \nhad migraine for many years, not only fo r a month. And they have surely got \nthemselves examined before.]  - 53 -  \n3.7.1.2 Clinical examination \nIn clinical treatement R. te sts the area of C0-C1 very ca refully, and also the mobility \nand motility of the liver applying  the visceral model. R. thinks that the liver plays a big \nrole in case of histamine intolerance and allergies. She examines the SSB following \nthe cranial model, the reciprocal tensi on membrane and the dura.  Structurally, she \nplaces the focus on Th7 and Th8. The area of the thoracic spine, which associated to \nthe liver. According to R., migraine patient s do not have malpositions or muscular \ndysbalances of the cervical spine or upper thoracic spin e more frequently than other \npatients.  R. 4:52-5: \u201eNein. W\u00fcrde ich jetzt nicht sagen, da ss das h\u00e4ufiger ist.\u201c[No. I wouldn\u2019t \nsay it\u2019s more frequently.]  \n \n3.7.2 Migraine \u2013 a vascular, neurochemic, my ofascial, mental, structural, hormonal \nproblem?  \nAccording to R. the cause lies mainly with in the vascular and neurochemic area. She \nthinks that migraine is a neur ochemic functional disorder, which has vascular effects. \nBut she also sees hormonal factors and t he psychy having an influence on migraine.  \n \n3.7.3 Treatment technique  \nR. treats migraine patients as follows:  \n\u2022 70% biodynamic and craniosacral \n\u2022 15% structural \n\u2022 15% visceral \nR. likes to start a therapy session with struct ural techniques. In case of a blocking of \nC0-C1 she sometimes manipulates. Dealing wit h older patients however or in case of \nhaving found a clue for a counterindication in examination, she prefers myofascial \ntechniques. She treats the liv er following the visceral model. If necessary, she \nmanipulates the correspondi ng thoracic vertebrae.  \nR. 12:37-4: \u201eWenn wir jetzt bei den strukturellen Techniken sind, C0, C1. Weil ich \neinfach finde, das geht manchmal so viel leichter. Wenn ich das strukturell wirklich \nauch \u00f6ffne. Oder es kommt auf den Patienten an. Ob das ein \u00e4lterer Patient ist oder - 54 - irgendwelche, Gefahren, ja, Kontraindi kationen. Dann w\u00fcrde ich C0, C1 eben \nmyofascial, zum Beispiel myofascial ma chen. Viszerale, wie gesagt, weil die Leber \nf\u00fcr mich ein sehr wichtiger Punkt dabei ist. Und es kann auch sein, dass ich, wenn ich viszeral arbeite, koppel ich das auch oft,  dass ich den dement sprechenden Wirbel \ndazu manipuliere\u201c[Talking about structural tec hniques, C0, C1. Because I think this is \nsometimes easier. If I can r eally open it structurally. Or it depends on the patient. \nWhether it is an older patient or some danger, well, counteri ndications. In this case I \nwould treat C0, C1 myofascially. Visceral, as mentioned, because I consider the liver \nan important aspect. It is also possible that  I combine it, while working viscerally, I \nadditionally manipulate the corresponding vertebra.]  \n \nIn the visceral field she often finds a probl em in the intestinal area. She balances \nsacrum and occiput according to the biodynam ic or craniosacral model. She resorts \nto biodynamic techniques when working on the vascular system in the head area and \non the hormonal axis (ovaries, hypohysis, thal amus,...), if she gained an indication in \nanamnesis that the migraine attacks depend on the menstrual cycle. She treats the \nmalpositon of the SSB with cranial te chniques. She frequently encounters a \ncompression in this area. Additionally s he often finds a compression and rotational \nmalposition in the C0-C1 segment. R. thinks that caution is in demand in the case of \nmigraine in order not to pr ovoke an attack. She starts where she can find a lesion. \nThis can be distal or proximal to the head.  R. 20:48-0: \u201eJa. Nicht zu viele Techniken. Da s finde ich gerade bei Migr\u00e4ne Patienten \nwichtig, dass man nicht zu viel macht. Weil die sind eh sehr heikle Patienten, \nMigr\u00e4ne Patienten.\u201c[Yes. Not too many techniques. Especia lly in case of migraine \npatients I consider it important not to do too much. Because they are very delicate \npatients anyway, the migraine patients.]  \n \n3.7.4 Treatment intervals:\n  \nR. does not assign different treatment intevals to migraine patients and other \npatients. She conducts the first two or thre e sessions at an interval of four weeks. \nThen she proceeds to an interval of six to eight weeks.  R. 18:22-7: \u201eAlso ich fange an, dass ich so die er sten zwei, drei Behandlungen in vier \nWochen Abst\u00e4nden machen. Und geh dann aber  auf 6 bis 8 Wochen Abst\u00e4nde \u00fcber, - 55 - weil das allgemein mein Behandlungsabstand ist.\u201c[I start off doing the first two or \nthree sessions at an interval of four weeks.  And then I proceed to intervals of six to \neight weeks, because this is gene rally my treatment interval.]  \n \n3.7.5 Measures in addition to the osteopathic treatment  \nR. considers the combination of  acupuncture and osteopathy good.  \nR. 22:32-2: \u201eIch finde die Kombination Akupunktu r und Osteopathie irrsinnig gut. Ich \nhabe die Erfahrung gemacht, dass das wahnsi nnig gut wirkt.\u201c[I really like the \ncombination of acupuncture and osteopathy. I experienced this working amazingly \nwell] \nShe also thinks that the entire traditi onal Chinese Medicine and homeopathy make a \ngood combination with osteopathy. In case of  patients who name allergies as trigger \nfactors, R. believes traditi onal Chinese medicine to bring about better results than \nhomeopathy. She considers it impor tant, that patients try to omit certain food in order \nto asssess their influences on migraine atta cks. As an example for such foodstuff R. \nnames cheese, dairy and red wine. R. also th inks that the factor stress as a certain \ninfluence on migraine, but not to such an extent as nutrition.  \nR. 24:09-9: \u201eSo wie Stress ein Faktor ist. Nur glaube ich nicht, dass das ein prim\u00e4rer \nFaktor ist. Bei Stress kriegen sie halt noch leichter Migr\u00e4ne. Dann haben die halt \nstatt, 3 Mal im Monat Migr\u00e4ne, 10 Mal im M onat Migr\u00e4ne.\u201c [Just as stress is a factor. \nBut I don\u2019t think it is a main factor. Stress  makes them even more like to get migrane. \nIn this case they suffer from migraine ten times a month instead of three times.]  \nR. cannot name treatments which have a neg ative mgirane. But according to her,  \nweight training carried out in correctly can be a problem.  \n3.7.6 Does the osteopathic treatment have a positive effect on migraine?  \n50% of patients do not suffer from migraine attacks anymore after R.\u2019s treatment. In \ncase of 30%, the intervals between t he migraine attacks get longer and/or the \nintensity of the attacks dimini shes. In the remaining cases she has to state that the \ntreatment does not have any success.  R. 25:30-6: \u201e Auf jeden Fall. Also, wie ich vorher  gesagt habe: 50 Prozent sind meiner \nErfahrung nach so gut wie geheilt. Und bei 30 Prozent haben Frequenz und Schwere \nnachgelassen.\u201c[Surely. As I have said befor e: 50 percent are as good as healed, - 56 - according to my experience. And in t he case of 30 percent, frequency and severity \ndiminished.]  \n3.7.7 Interaction therapist - patient  \nIn case of patients who hav e been suffering from migraine for many years and with a \nhigh frequency of attacks, the application of osteopathic techniques has to be carried \nout very delicately. It is also required to  be very sensitive while dealing with these \npatients, because they suffer a lot. R. did not experience migraine  patients suffering \nfrom depressions more frequently than others.  R. 26:29-3: \u201eWenn einer alle zwei, drei Monate  Migr\u00e4ne hat, dann ist das nicht so \ndramatisch. Aber wenn einer sehr h\u00e4ufig Migr\u00e4ne hat, dann ist er ein sehr leidender \nTyp. Und der braucht oft m ehr Feinf\u00fchligkeit und mehr Aufmerksamkeit und mehr.... \nja, sachte Behandlung.\u201d [If somebody suffe rs from migraine every two or three \nmonths, it\u2019s not that dramatic. But if some one has from migraine very frequently, they \nare very suffering persons. And they need more delicacy and more attention and \nmore, tender treatment.]  \n \n \n3.8 Summary of the interv iew with expert C. (male)\n \nIn the following the interview with expert B ., which was conducted on the basis of the \ninterview guideline menti oned above, is summarized. \n3.8.1 Anamnesis and clinical examination  \n3.8.1.1 Anamnesis \nFor C., as being physician and osteopath, in ternistic findings are particularly \nimportant. Do the patients have circulat ion problems, do they suffer from \nhypertension, are they exposed to increas ed toxic strain? Furthermore he is very \ninterested  his patients\u2018 vaccinations, as  he assumes that there is a connection \nbetween vaccinations and c hanges of the dura.  \nC. 1:53-2: \u201eUnd die Impfungen, gang wichtig . Weil Impfungen auch die Dura soweit \nver\u00e4ndern, dass ein neuer Reiz praktisch  die Dura wieder triggern kann und dann \nkann es zu Auftreten von Kopfschmerz en kommen.\u201d  [And vaccinations, very - 57 - important, because they cause changes of the dura in so far, as a new stimulus can \ntrigger the dura again and then headache may be the consequence.] \nAdditionally C. asks his pati ents whether their migraine is accompanied by an aura or \nnot and if there are any abnormities dur ing the prodrome phase. The hormonal \naspect plays an important role for him as we ll and he tries to find out whether it has \nan influence on migraine or not. Furthermore he asks his patients if they could detect \nany connection between lunar phases or changes  in weather and their attacks. And if \nthey have ever suffered a whiplash or  any pulmonary diseases, as these can \nconstrict the thorax via fascial tensi on and, as a consequence, can lead to the \ndevelopment of migraine. \nC. 2:57-1: \u201eEs ist weniger, bei Migr\u00e4ne, glaube ich weniger an Ursachen als an \nMosaiksteinchen. Weil f\u00fcr mich das ein zi emlich ein komplexeres Thema ist.\u201d [It\u2019s \nless, in case of migraine I believe more in \u201cpieces of a puzzle\u201d than in causes. Because in my opinion that\u2019s a highly complex subject.] \nHe thinks that the psychosomatic aspect plays a very important role concerning \njuvenile migraine. But also in case of adults this aspect should not be disregarded. \nHowever, in case of adults this psychosomat ic element is structurally overlaid a little \nmore and surfaces only after a few treat ments. C. detected a connection between \nmigraine and depression.  \n3.8.1.2 Clinical examination \n C. examines the patient by means of  biodynamic palaption according to the \nbiodynamic model. He pays special att ention to the dura and watches out for \npossible compressions in this area and if he encounters some, tries to find out where \nit is compressed. In case of a total compression very often a general trauma in the \npast is the cause; for example a whiplash trauma or a cerebral concussion or a toxic \ncause. Subsequently he investigates the horizontal gates, applying the biodynamic \nmodel, in order to find out if the dura is  compressed there. During the biodynamic \npalpation, he also checks whet her there is a possible ever sion or inversion blockade. \nC. 5:27-9: \u201eKlinische Untersuchun gen, da gehe ich, in de biodynamische \nPalpationen, wenn du so willst. Das hei\u00dft, ich schau mir einfach vom Kopf an, was ich so sp\u00fcre. Also der erste Eindruck ist es eine eversions oder inversions \nBlockierung. Eine Dura Kompression, das is t einmal das Erste. Ich nehme den Kopf - 58 - und schaue, ob er schwer ist oder nicht. Wenn der 50 Tonnen hat, dann wei\u00df ich, \nhoppala, die Dura ist in einer schwer en Kompression drin. Und da kann ich schon \neinmal anfangen, mich zu konzentrieren, wo  k\u00f6nnte die Dura komprimiert sein. Und \nschau mir die horizontalen Gates an um zu schauen ob die Dura da komprimiert ist. \nUnd wenn es aber eine total Kompression ist, im Kopf Bereich. Dann ist es meistens entweder toxisch oder auf Grund eines allgemeine Traumas, im Sinne, von \nPeitschenschlag, Commotio\u201c [Clinical examin ation, I go into biodynamic palpation, \nlet\u2019s put it like that. That means, I look fr om the head what I feel. The first impression, \nis there an eversion or inversion blockade. A dura compression that\u2019s the first thing. I \ntake the head and take look whether it\u2019s hea vy or not. If it weighs 50 tons, I know, \noops, the dura is in a severe compression. And then I can start to concentrate, where \ncould it be compressed. And then I take a look at the horiz ontal gates and try to find \nout where the dura is compresse d. And if it is a total compression, in the head area, \nthen it\u2019s mostly toxicall y conditioned or caused by a general trauma, just like \nwhiplash, commotion.] \nC. states that in his opini on the dura is frequently comp ressed in case of migraine \npatients. He traces this back to blockades in the area of the te ndorium; that these \ntensions compress an artery and when it  is de-blocked, headache might be the \nresult. According to him met abolism may be one of the causes  as well, for example if \nthe patient is slagged and thus acetose. Th is again leads to a vascular compression \nthat opens due to an additional occurring factor  and thus triggers pain, once more via \nvasodilatation. C. also conducts a general vascular palpat ion by means of biodynamic palpation and \nvery often feels a general vasoconstric tion (a marker of latent hypertension \nproneness) in case of migraine patients. He  thinks that these patients possibly suffer \nfrom a permanent psychic compression and that relaxation (e.g. on weekends) can \nlead to vasodilatation, which causes the headache. \nC.7:33-1: \u201eDa habe auch sehr oft Leute, die Migr\u00e4ne haben. Die dann oft in einer \npsychischen Dauerkompression drin sind, wo  die Gef\u00e4\u00dfe einfach zu sind. Und das \nsind dann die Leute, die die Migr\u00e4ne dann am Wochenende bekommen, wann sie \nsich entspannen k\u00f6nnen. Weil dann gehen die Gef\u00e4\u00dfe auf, und dann haben sie die Beschwerden und Schmerzen. Solange sie zu si nd, sp\u00fcren sie eigentlich nichts.\u201c [I \noften have patients who suffer from migr aine who are in a permanent psychic \ncompression and whose vessels are simply  closed. And these are the people who - 59 - suffer migraine attacks on weekends, when they  can relax. Because that\u2019s when the \nvessels re-open and then they feel pain. As l ong as they are closed they feel actually \nno pain.] \nFurthermore C. thinks that concerning ment ally triggered migraine also a reverse \npattern exists, namely Sunday-night-migraine. \nC. 8:05-9: \u201eNein, das ist diese vor, vor ziehende Angst. Was wird morgen sein. \nW\u00e4hrend die Wochen Migr\u00e4ne, Wochenend- Migr\u00e4ne ist eine \nEntspannungsmigr\u00e4ne.\u201c [No, that\u2019s this sort of fearful expectation of what\u2019s going to \nhappen tomorrow. During the week migraine;  weekend migraine is a sort of \nrelaxation migraine.] \nDuring the clinical examination C. also inve stigates the temporal bone, the skull base \nand the vertebral artery. He also examines the patients\u2019 eyes, as from his point of \nview problems in this area very often reflec torically lead to a tension of the occipital \nmuscles which can trigger migraine as well.  In his opinion migraine patients very \noften have malpositions and muscular dysbal ances of cervical and upper thoracic \nspine. \nC. 9:21-2: \u201eJa, Ja. Hundertprozentig.\u201c [Yes, yes. A hundred per cent.] \nC. encounters whole chains of lesions in compression on the cervical spine, a whole \nnumber of vertebrae that do not  move. Very often the cerv icothoracic transition is \naffected as well. Many times compressi ons are associated with a rotation.  \nC. 15:59-8: \u201eJa. Der cervico-thoracale \u00dcbergang. Oft dann, es geht da in einem zick \nzack Muster rauf. Da habe ich einen auf der rechten Seite und einen auf der linken \nSeite. Den muss man in der richtigen Reihen folge manipulieren, damit man die Kette \nwirklich aufl\u00f6st. Wenn man nur so hinein manipuliert, dann geht es einfach wieder \nzu.\u201c [Yes, the cervicothoracic transition. Ve ry often it takes a zigzag line. One is on \nthe right hand side and the other one on the left. In such cases you have to \nmanipulate in the right order in order to really loosen the chai n. If you manipulate \naround just like that, it closes immediately again.] \nHe encounters the occipito-atlanto-axial (O AA) complex blocked as compensation on \nthe left hand side in 85% of cases. \nC. 10:03-2: \u201eUnd das, zu 85 Prozent haben sie das OAA auch auf der linken Seite \nblockiert. Warum das so ist, das wei\u00df ich nicht.\u201c [And that, in 85% of cases the OAA \nis blocked on the left hand side. I really  don\u2019t know why it is like that.) \n - 60 - 3.8.2 Migraine- a vascular, neurochemic, my ofascial, mental, structural. hormonal \nproblem?  \nFor C. in case of migraine the hormonal factor plays a prominent role, but the \nneurochemic as well as a mental aspec t are important for him as well. \nC. 12:58-0: \u201eEigentlich schon. Also, ic h w\u00fcrde das Hormonelle sehr stark im \nVordergrund haben. Das Neurochemische au f jeden Fall. Und das Psychische mit \neiner myofascialen Auswirkung dann.\u201c [Act ually yes. The hormonal aspect is \ndefinitely in the foregro und. And the neurochemic one as  well. And the psyche with \nall its myofascial effects.] \nC. regards the whol e neuro-immune-humeral system as  a unit in which one element \ninfluences the other. For him the only ex ceptions are toxic causes, such as \nvaccination damages or expired meningitides that trigger t he dura in such a way that \nit goes into compression.   \n3.8.3 Treatment techniques\n \nC.  mostly works by means of the biody namic model, followed by structural and \nvisceral techniques. Biodynamically he mainly  treats the dura and the level of fluids. \nOn a biodynamic level it is very important to him to relax the dura, but also the area \nbetween dura and arachnoid, where he fr equently encounters adherences. On a \nstructural level he manipulates the spine. Vi a fascial flow or potency, respectively, C. \ncan feel which of the vert ebrae have to be manipulated. \nC. 16:55-6: \u201eOft ist es so, dass mir di e Potency den Weg zeigt. Das hei\u00dft, wenn ich \nPotency orientiert arbeite, nicht l\u00e4sions orientiert, dann habe ich von der Potency \nserviert kriegt, die Reihenfolge der Inte rvention. Wenn ich das nicht mache und \nL\u00e4sionsorientiert arbeite, dann manipuliere ich irgendwas und wei\u00df nicht ob ich in der \nrichtigen Reihenfolge bin.\u201c [It\u2019s the potency that very often shows me the way. I mean \nif I work in a potency-orient ed and not so much lesion-ori ented way, it tells me the \norder in which the interventions shall take plac e. If I don\u2019t do so, I mean, if I work in a \nmore lesion-oriented way, I manipulate just  something and I don\u2019t know whether it is \nthe right order.]    \nVery often C. encounters blockades at the u pper thoracic spine. However, cervical \nspine, sacrum and coccyx are not blocked t hat many times. In case of migraine \npatients C. sometimes detects a blockade of metatarsus or ankle joint that, according - 61 - to him, can lead to a lateralization of t he midline and, as a consequence, can affect \nthe head. Thereby he refers to the m odel of midline, Dunshirn 2006.  \nC. applies the visceral model to work on the organs of excretion, i.e. kidneys, liver, \nlymph and bowel, whereby the liver seems to be most important to him. Furthermore \nC. frequently discerns that omentum minus and gall duct are twiste d, which leads to \na congestion in liver and gall bladder.  \nIf stress is one of the trigger  factors, he pays special a ttention to the area of the \nsacral plexus and the hypogastric plexus and tries to achieve harmonization in this \narea. \nC. 28:56-5: \u201eWeil, oft ist es auch eine unt erdr\u00fcckt sexuelle Energie, oder auch eine \nZwerchfellblockierung, die die Migr\u00e4ne ausl\u00f6 st. Das sind alles Dinge die wichtig sind. \nAber ich bin ja kein Psychologe. Das hei \u00dft ich frage nicht, ob sie nicht schlafen will \nmit ihrem Freund oder sonst was oder irgend wie Dings. Das geht mich nichts an. \nAber ich sp\u00fcre dass das, sogenannte zweite Chakra, das hei\u00dft, diese Nervenkomplexe im unteren Bauchbereich, dass die bei der Migr\u00e4ne sehr wichtig \nsind.\u201c [Because very often it is suppre ssed sexual energy or a blocking of the \ndiaphragm that triggers migraine. All these things are very important. But I\u2019m not a \npsychologist. I don\u2019t ask her if she does not  want to sleep with her boyfriend or \nsomething like that. That\u2019s none of my bus iness. But I can feel that they, the so-\ncalled second chakra, these nervous comp lexes in the area of the lower abdomen \nthat they are important in case of migraine.] \nWhen C. treats migraine patients, he follo ws the potency to those areas where \ntreatment is necessary. Thereby it is irrelev ant if he starts proxim al or distal to the \nhead or not. The potency shows him the way. \nC. 26:45-1: \u201eSo wie es sich anf\u00fchlt. Ich bin im Zentrum des Geschehens. Aber wenn \ndas Potential mich weg f\u00fchrt,  dann f\u00fchrt es mich einfach weg. Manchmal bei akuten \nSchmerzen ist es gescheit mit der Leber anzufangen oder mit dem Bauch.\u201c [The way \nit feels like. I\u2019m right there in the middle.  But if the potency leads me away, then it \njust leads me away. Sometimes, in case of ac ute pain, it is useful to start with liver or \nabdomen.] \n3.8.4 Treatment intervals\n \nC. treats migraine patients approx imately every six weeks. He thinks it is no good to \ntreat them too often, because there is congestion existent already. - 62 - C. 23:46-9: \u201eIch habe, ich h\u00e4tte nicht da Gef\u00fchl, dass Migr\u00e4ne Patienten, eine, \nmassive, weil alles was du ihnen zus\u00e4tzlich als Energie hinein gibst, m\u00fcssen sie \nzuerst verarbeiten. Migr\u00e4ne Patienten haben sehr gerne einen Stau. Wenn du zu \nsehr intervenierst, dann wirst du den Stau einfach auch vermehren. Darum bin ich \nnicht daf\u00fcr, dass man die ziemlich h\u00e4ufig be handelt.\u201c [I have the fee ling that in case \nof migraine patients, if y ou fill them with too much energy  they have to process them \nat first. Migraine patients frequently have congestions. If you invest too much you will \nsimply increase that congestion. That\u2019s wh y I\u2019m against treating them too often.] \nC. thinks that too much therapeutic input can have negative effects on migraine. All \ntechniques should be applied carefully. \n3.8.5 Measures in addition to the osteopathic treatment  \nC. thinks that every measure that leads aw ay from the head is a useful additional \nmeasure, such as e.g. foot baths, Knei pp cures, matrix treatments and cupping. In \ncase nutrition is one of the triggers, one s hould check out different foodstuffs with the \naid of homeopathy, in order to find out wh ich are the ones the patient does not \ntolerate. C. found out that milk and wheat ar e very often not tolerated. However, he \nnoticed that glutamate intoler ance is the most common one. \nC. 19:10-7: \u201eUnd vor allem die Glutam ate. Weil die d\u00fcrften Gef\u00e4\u00dfreaktionen \nhervorrufen, im Sinn von einer Histaminaus ssch\u00fcttung, die dann zu einer lokalen \n\u00dcbers\u00e4uerung f\u00fchren. Und zu einer Durchbl utungsst\u00f6rung, zu einer regionalen. Und \ndann kann es auch zum Kopf schmerz kommen.\u201c [And above all the glutamates. \nBecause they seem to evoke vascular reacti ons in terms of histamine release which \nin turn causes overacidification and local circulation disturbance.] \nC. thinks that - if carried out incorrectl y - massages and yoga have negative effects. \nC. 27:02-9: \u201eMassieren, das schlimmste was es gibt. Und Yoga. \u201c [Massages, the \nworst thing possible. And yoga.] \nFurthermore he states that crash diets can have a negati ve influence on mirgaine, \ntoo, because they can bring about changes in metabolism.  \n3.8.6 Does the osteopathic treatment have a positive effect on migraine?\n \nC. clearly answers the question with yes. - 63 - C. 29:26-0: \u201eIch habe auch Leute die kei ne Migr\u00e4ne mehr haben.\u201c [I have patients \nwho suffer from migraine no longer.] \nThus there are patients\u2019 whose migraine to tally disappeared. Howe ver, C. also has \npatients whom he could not help. \nC. 30:10-4: \u201eWo das Umfeld so stark is t, dass man eigentlich keine Chance hat.\u201c \n[When the environment so  strong that you have no chance at all.] \n \n3.8.7 Interaction therapist - patient  \nAccording to C. it is bette r to treat migraine patients not  too cautiously, although he \nstates that they would wish for tha t. He thinks that they tend to behave \noversensitively. Under pressure they go down immediately. By means of using a \nbiodynamic technique from the biodynamic m odel C. tries to accommodate them to \ntheir environment, make them to  accept wideness in order to  improve drainage. It is \nimportant to him that treatment is not too focused but takes into consideration a wide \nrange of aspects. \n4 Discussion of the treatment approaches mentioned in the expert \ninterviews  \nThe individual expert interviews that we re summarized under chapter 3 of this paper, \nrevealed impressive, but rather individual results concerning the different osteopaths\u2018 \napproaches of the treatm ent of migraine patients. As a next step it is important to \ninterrelated these results and compare them to the available liter ature. Subsequently \ndue to the accordances significant statem ents concerning \u201ctreatment approaches in \nosteopathy for the therapy of migraine\u201d can be made. Furthermore it is possible to \ndraw conclusions whether osteopathy is a useful method of treatment for patients \nwho suffer from migraine. A dditionally practical advice concerning the concrete \nosteopathic treatment of mi graine patients, e.g. on wh ich aspects the therapist \nshould place special emphasis, can be gained.  - 64 - 4.1 Anamnesis  \nIt is important for all my interviewees  that their migraine patients have been \nexamined previously by a c onventional medical practitioner. Usually they come to \nsee the osteopath after having suffered fr om migraine already for a long time. \nIf they have not been exami ned beforehand, the os teopaths tell them to see a \nphysicians for further clearing investigati ons. Basically anamnesis does not differ \nvery much from the anamnesis  of other patients. All osteopaths ask patients about \nthe precise course of the disease: Ho w? How often? Since when? Was there any \nspecific trigger? Is the migraine accom panied by an aura? For C. as a physician \ninternistic findings are of particular interest , e.g circulation, toxic strain, vaccinations \netc. For R. it is important  whether there is a genetic background (cf. ch. 2.1.2). Four \nof the seven interviewees ask detailed questions about traumata in the past: were \nthere any accidents? Falls? Operations? They found out that such traumata can \nsecondarily lead to tensions in the dural syst em (Ligner 2008, Liem 2001). Six of the \nseven interviewed osteopaths consider the hormonal factor important (M\u00fcller 2007, \nFukui 2008, WHO 2004). Furthermore most of  them try to find out whether their \npatients\u2018 suffer from defecti ve vision, food intolerances, stress, change of weather \nand dental problems (cf. ch. 2.5). This co rresponds to Zvadinov 2003, Robbins 1994, \nFukui 2008, Baumhackl 2007, Keidel 2007, Spannbauer 2008, Tuchin  2000.for C. the \npsychosomatic aspect plays a major role as well, especially in the case of juvenile \nmigraine. A. asks if the patient has got any information about his/her own birth. To S. \nit is important to find out if  the patient has had any operations  in spinal anesthesia or \nepidural anesthesia because of possible in fluences on the dural system. Only for P. \nthe trigger factors are not that important, maybe exce pt for stress and hormonal \ncontribution. All osteopaths agr ee that stress is a prominent  trigger factor. B., P. and \nR. could not detect any connection bet ween migraine and the development of a \ndepression. By contrast, C.  and M. experienced that t here is a connection between \nmigraine and depression (Breslau 2003, Keidel 2007, Spannbauer 2008).  \n \n4.2 Clinical examination  \nC., A. and M. examine the pat ient applying the biodynamic model. Thereby for M. the \nmodel of midline and the model of the craniosacral rhythm are an important \norientation. C. pays attention to the dur a, whether he encounters any compression in - 65 - the biodynamic model and conducts a general  vascular palpation and feels where \nthere are any spinal blockades. A. and M. conduct additional neurological tests, \nincluding sensibility testing of the cervical spine. For M. and P. the pelvic area plays \nan important role in clinical investigati on. P. and S. thoroughly test their patients \nstructurally from coccyx to head (cf. Still 1910).  B., M. and R. consider it essential to \nstructurally examine the upper cervical spine, and thereby mainly C0-C1 as well as \nthoracic spine (above all that  part that is associated with the liver) (cf. Ligner 2008, \nLiem 2001, Gallagher 2005, Loza 1998 sowie Kap.  2.5.6). R., C. and A. frequently \nnotice a compression connected to rotation in the upper cervical spine of migraine patients. According to P. in case of migr aine patients the first ri bs are blocked nearly \n100%. C. sometimes finds a blockade of the metatarsus or ankle joint which can lead \nto a lateralization of the midline and thus affect the head. Concerning issue of organs \nthat are problematic in case of migrai ne, there is great accordance between the \ninterviewees as well. B., R., C., A. and S. detect that migraine patients show a \ndecrease of mobility and/or motility of liver, gall and bowel. Most often these \nsymptoms are to be found in the liver. A states that  the duodenum can be impaired \nas well. C. pays special attention to all or gans of excretion, i.e.  kidneys, liver, lymph \nand bowel. The model of the craniosacral system places emphasis on SSB, sphenoid, reciprocal tension membrane, dur al tension, temporal bone, vascular \ntension and jaw bone (Sutherland 1930, Li gner 2008, Liem 2001,  Milne 1999).   \n \n4.2.1 Accordances concerni ng clinical examination\n \nNo matter which model the osteopaths apply to  examine their patient s, they all detect \na problem in the area of the upper cervical spine, especially in the area of C0-C1 \n(Ligner 2008, Loza 1998). In te rms of the visceral model there is major consensus \nregarding the liver. Except for P. this organ pl ays a central role for all interviewees. A \nthird accordance regards the dura as a decisiv e factor in respect of migraine. This \nalso corresponds to Ligner 2008, Loza 1998, Liem 2001.  \n4.2.2 Abnormities concerning the cervical spine\n \nThe answers to the question whether mi graine patients more frequently show \nmalpositions or muscular dysbalances of cervical spine and upper thoracic spine - 66 - were divided but clear. Four of my interviewees do not see any connection here. As \nR. puts it (4:52-5):  \u201eW\u00fcrde ich jetzt nicht sagen, dass das h\u00e4ufiger ist\u201c . [I wouldn\u2019t \nsay that that\u2019s more frequent.]  However, the other three ar e of the opinion that there \nis a connection. A. answers the question as follows (3:32-2): \u201eAlle, ausnahmslos, \nalle\u201c [All. All without any exception.] and C. states (9:21-2): \u201eJa, ja, hundertprozentig\u201c . \n[Yes, yes. A hundred per cent.] \n \nLiterature reflects these divided opinions  as well. Studies by Hagino (1992), Kidd \n(1993) and Marcus (1999) revealed such a connection. Evers (2006) on the other hand could not detect this connection, wher eby he does not rely on studies but \ninterprets anatomic connections in hi s work:  \u201eVerspannungen der Nackenmuskulatur \nsind keine Trigger f\u00fcr die Migr\u00e4neattacke  sondern Ausdruck einer gleichzeitigen \nMitaktivierung von Nervenzellen, die die Muskulatur des Nacken und Halsbereiches \ninnervieren\u201c (Evers 2006, Seite 41). [Tensi ons of the neck muscles are no trigger of \nmigraine attacks but an expression of a simu ltaneous co-activation of nerve cells that \ninnervate the neck muscles.]  The problem in unambiguously answer ing the question about this connection \nmentioned above seems to be, that migraine o ften occurs in combination with tension \nheadache or cervical headache. As for ex ample C. puts it (12:27-0): \u201e[\u2026] Dass der \nsowohl einen echten Kopfschmerz hat, als auch eine Migr\u00e4ne. Und es ist so, dass es \noft in der Therapie dann so ist, dass zuer st die Kopfschmerzen verschwinden. Und \nzwar wirklich verschwinden. Er hat dann noc h immer den Migr\u00e4ne Anfall, F\u00e4lle, die \nwerden aber weniger heftig, in der D auer. Und sind auch weniger h\u00e4ufig. Und dann \nmuss man da weiter tun. Und da muss man dann meistens auf die toxische oder \npsychologische Ebene gehen. Das hei\u00dft, es gibt sowas wie einen zusammengesetzten Kopfschmerz, auch bei der Migr\u00e4ne. Und den Teil, den \nstrukturellen Teil kann man relativ bal d abbauen. Also, die Leute haben dann nicht \nmehr diese Konstanzen in den Beschwerden. [\u2026]\u201c.  [That he has real headaches as \nwell as migraine. And it\u2019s like that that in therapy t he headache often disappears, and \nI mean really disappears. He  still has the migraine attack,  attacks, but they are less \nintense in duration. And they occur less o ften. And then you have to proceed, go to a \ntoxic or psychological level. That means that there is something like compound - 67 - headache, even in case of migraine. And that  part, the structural  part is easy to \nreduce. People don\u2019t have these cons tant complaints anymore. [\u2026]]  \nThus the treatment of malpositions or muscular dysbalances of cervical spine and \nupper thoracic spine can lead to the disappearance of headaches and, as a \nconsequence, can also change migraine pain.  \nOn the whole it is difficult to assess up to  what extent dysfunctions of the cervical \nspine is an additional trigger of a migr aine attack. The statements and opinions on \nthe part of the interviewees are ambiguous. Fu rthermore it seems as if in practice \nsometimes it would be hard to distingu ish migraine from tension headache.  \nAdditionally the corresponding st atements in literatur e are incomplete (lacking control \ngroups (Hagino 1992), small numbers of  test (Kidd 1993, Marcus 1999), no \nconsideration of the cu rrent headaches (Kidd 1993)). \n \n4.3 Factors of in fluence on migraine\n \nIn my interviews I asked the osteoptahs if migraine is a vascular, neurochemic, \nmyofascial, mental, structural and/or ho rmonal problem. According to the answers \nthe hormonal factor plays a major role fo r all interviewees (M\u00fcller 2007, Fukui 2008). \nFor C., M. and R. the mental factor with all its myofascial  expressions is important, \ntoo; as well as the neurochemic model (cf. ch . 2.4.4). By contrast, B. could not detect \na psychic influence on migraine. B.,R. and A.  put the vascular factor to the fore.  \nHowever, all osteopaths agree that basica lly all the different  factors could be \nrelevant. One system influences the other. In this respect A. refers to the osteopathic \nphilosophy of treatment:  \u201e Eine Ursache kann zehn Auswirkungen haben. Eine \nAuswirkung zehn Ursachen. Ja, ich glaube n\u00e4mlich nicht an irgendeine Struktur. Weil \nso was gibt es nicht, leider. [\u2026] Also ich sehe welche Komb inationen sich da \naufgebaut haben, die zu eine m Migr\u00e4ne Fall gef\u00fchrt haben. Also, man beginnt mit \nder Struktur, dann schaut man die kn\u00f6cherne Struktur, im Vergle ich zum Hirn bzw. \nzum Duralsystem. Dann das Duralsystem, inkludierend das ven\u00f6se System bzw. \nSinuse \u201c.  [One cause can have ten effects, and one effect ten causes. Yes, because I \ndon\u2019t believe in one structur e, unfortunately something like that does not exist. \nOtherwise everything would be so easy fo r us and the physicians. Well, I see \ncombinations that have est ablished and that have led to migraine. You start with the - 68 - structure, then you take a look at the bony  structure, as compared to brain or the \ndural system, respectively. An then you tu rn to the dural syst em, including the \nvenous system and the sinuses, respectively.]  \nAll of them stress that  everything interrelates (cf. ch. 2.8) and that this is the reason \nwhy detailed anamnesis and osteopathic exami nation are of such great importance. \nOnly then the osteopaths can puzzle out wher e to begin. This is one of the reasons \nwhy osteopathy seems to be an appropriate  and useful method of therapy for the \ntreatment of migraine patients.   \n4.4 Treatment techniques\n \n4.4.1 General information about treatment techniques  \nWith the aid of the diagnosis the osteopath tr ies to improve the disturbed function of \nthe tissue by means of certain techniqu es. Among the many available osteopathic \ntechniques there are rather gent le ones but there are also manipulations by means of \nwhich the osteopath tries to re-establish m obility or motility, respectively. Which \ntechnique is chosen depends on diagnosis, the therapist\u2019s approach and his/her \nenvironment. It is one of the mo st important abilities of an osteopath to adjust and \napply the right technique to the individual patient. There is no real division into \ncranial, visceral, venolymphatic or parietal osteopathy. How the os teopath works, i.e. \nwhat he/she concretely applies depends on time and case. However, one always has \nto respect the osteopathic principles in or der to achieve lasti ng results (Liem 2002). \nAn overview of all treatment techniques that are applied in osteopathy can be found \ne.g. in Leitfaden Osteopathie (Guideline osteopathy)  (Liem 2002). Nevertheless I \ndecided to categorize my interviews accord ing to the treatment techniques used by \nmy interviewees. This helped me in anal yzing which osteopathic models the experts \napply.   \n4.4.2 Frequency of ost eopathic models applied\n \nIn my interviews I tried to get my intervie wees to assign their treatment techniques to \nthe osteopathic models \u201cstructural\u201d, \u201cvisce ral\u201d, \u201ccraniosacral\u201d and \u201cbiodynamic\u201d. \nThereby could be revealed that usually all models are applied for the treatment of \nmigraine patients and that many  of the osteopaths even s witch from one model to - 69 - another during one session. They hardl y ever made a distinction between \nbiodynamic and craniosacral model. Summarizing ly the results of the interviews can \nbe depicted as follows:   \nExpert Structural model Visceral model Biodynamic and \ncraniosacral model \nS. 40% 20% 40% \nB. 33% 33% 33% \nR. 15% 15% 70% \nC.  least of all most of all \nP. equal in all models \nM. 20% 20% 50% biodynamic \n10% craniosacral \nA.   100% biodynamic \n \nFig. 3: Models of t he osteopathic treatment  \n This diagram shows that the biodynamic -craniosacral model seems to be most \nimportant (Liem 2001, Sutherland 1930,  Milne1999). Treatm ents following the \nvisceral model seem to be applied least of a ll. This corresponds to literature again, \nwhere rather few indications to vi sceral techniques can be found either. \n \n4.4.3 Structural model\n \nSix of the seven interviewees manipulate or  mobilize, respectively, those vertebrae \nthey find blocked in the same way as Still 1930, Ligner 2008 and Gallagher 2005. R., \nB. and P. additionally apply muscle-energy techniques, contract-release techniques \nand balance-techniques. C. manipulates those ve rtebrae of the cervical spine that he \nfinds in lesion, mostly in a compression -rotation-malposition. The cervicothoracic \ntransition is frequently affected, too. Mostly he finds the left occipito-atlanto-axial joint \nas compensation. Furthermore he manipulat es upper thoracic spine and metatarsus \nor ankle joint if he encounters them block ed during the clinical examination. P. \nstructurally treats the pelvis,  and therebyespecially the sa crum, by means of Mitchell-\ntechniques. He treats blockades of the lumb ar spine in a lumbar role position by \nmeans of contract-release techniques. Fu rthermore he manipulates the thoracic - 70 - spine and conducts functional mobilizations of the cervical spine. If necessary he \nloosens the first rib, again by use of Mitchell-techniques. M. uses structural \ntechniques mainly in case of severe impairment, as this makes it easier to \nsubsequently apply the biodynamic model. B. applies Mittchell-techniques and \nbalance techniques in order to loosen C0-C1.  In case of muscula r tigger points she \nuses a contract-release technique. She m obilizes blockades of the coccyx and the \npelvic ring and manipulates blockades of th e thoracic spine. S. conducts spinal \nmanipulations of the whole spine- depending on what she finds during the previous \nclinical examination. R. also manipulat es those vertebrae she finds in lesion. \nHowever, in case of C0-C1 she additi onally uses myofascial techniques. \n \n4.4.4 Visceral model  \nThe visceral model focuses on organs that  have shown abnormities in clinical \nexamination. S. assumes that the organ function can be improved by techniques \nsuch as mobilization of liver suspension or liver pump (in case of congestion). B., too, \napplies the liver pump in such cases and treats the intestinal area with its \nadherences in case of food intolerances.  C. tries to untwist twistings of omentum \nminus with the gall duct, which can lead to liver congestions in order to achieve relaxation within the visceral model.  \n4.4.5 Craniosacral model\n \nR., C., S. and P. pay special attention to a good function of the skull base (cf. \nSutherland) which is particularly important according to the craniosacral model. P. \ntries to harmonize the mobilit y of the individual cranial bones and to release sutures \nand subsequently works on the level of fluids by use of the craniosacral model. To B. \nit is important to achieve a relaxation of  the tendorium and a ha rmonization along the \nhormonal axis, which is both significant in the craniosacral model. In this sense she \nbalances the sacrum. In case there are problems concerning venous drainage, she \nrelaxes the diaphragm, the superficial ce rvical fascias and carries out a sinus \ndrainage (cf. Ligner 2008). By means of interora l techniques S. tries to work on the \nskull base whereby she expects, according to  the craniosacral model, a relaxation of \nthe dura. All osteopaths agree t hat in the craniosacral model the relaxation of the - 71 - dura is of major importance. This corre sponds to Ligner (2008), Loza (1998), Liem \n(2001). According to the interviewees there are several different techniques that can \nbe applied in order to achieve a relaxation of  the dura, such as interoral techniques, \nworking on the sacrum, balancing/syn chronizing sacrum and occiput.  \n \n4.4.6 Biodynamic model  \nThe biodynamic model aims at a relaxation of  the dura as well. With this in mind S., \nC., R. and M. apply this model in the treatme nt of migraine patients. Working on the \nlevel of fluids according to this biodynamic  model is of great importance for C., M. \nand R. S. thinks that within this model a re laxation of the anterio r transverse septum \nor of its onsets, respectively can be ac hieved which can have positive effects on \nmigraine. To M. furthermore working acco rding to the model of midline and working \non the pelvis is important. M. considers feeling a strong longitudinal fluctuation \nimportant, which is a sign of vitality accord ing to the biodynamic model. P. calls it \nmaking a basic adjustment. C. finds even further treatment approaches for the \ntherapy of migraine in t he biodynamic model: he loosens  the area between dura and \narachnoid where he frequently detects adherences  and thereby achieves a relaxation \nof the dura. He pays special attention to sacral plexus and hypogastric plexus if \nstress is one of the trigger  factors of migraine. Appl ying the biodynamic model, R. \naims at harmonizing the hormonal axis (ova ries, pituitary, thalamus) and works on \nthe vascular system of the cranial area. A.  examines by means of the biodynamic \nmodel each level step by step and layer by  layer in order to be able to clearly \ndifferentiate, where the problem is located. T hereby he investigates the level of fluid, \nlymph area and the visceral ar ea. He orients himself by  vitality and quality of the \nsystem, which is a highly important  aspect in the biodynamic model. \n4.4.7 Is it necessary to be particularly cautious?   \nMost osteopaths consider it important to be particularly cautious when it comes to \napplying the treatment techniques to mi graine patients, bec ause the system is \noverwrought anyway and thus migraine atta cks may be triggered easily. However, P. \nand A. are of adverse opinion.  According to  A. in the biodynamic model an initial \nexacerbation is a sign that t he patient\u2019s ability to react is  still existent, i.e. that the \nbody still has got the capacity of coming out of its old pattern and to move towards - 72 - improvement. A. and P. explain their patient s in very much detail that due to the \ntreatment certain reactions can set in.  \n4.5 Treatment intervals\n \n \n \n \n           \n \nFig.4: Treatment intervals concerni ng the treatment of migraine patients \n C., S. and M. are of the opi nion that especially migraine  patients should not be \ntreated too often. On the one hand because there are al ready congestions and on \nthe other hand because those patients are already at an overwrought level and thus \nadditional energy that is brought into t he system has to be measured carefully. The \nbody should get enough time to stabilize af ter treatment and regeneration should \nhappen in an unimpeded way.   \n4.6 Recommendations for additional therapy\n \nThe interviews reveal that the osteopat hs largely agree that traditional Chinese \nmedicine, and above all acupuncture, can hav e positive effects on the alleviation of \nmigraine symptoms (M\u00fcller 2009, B\u00e4cke r 2008, Linde 2009). Many of the Expert Intervals Number Remarks \nS. 4 - 6 weeks Not specified  \nB. 2 - 5 weeks  Depending on treatment \ntechniques \nR. At first 4 weeks \nsubsequently 6 -8 \nweeks Not specified No difference as \ncompared to other \npatients \nC. Every 6 weeks Not specified  \nP. 5 - 6 weeks \n 2 - 3 times  \nM. 3-6 weeks \nLater 3-4 months Not specified  \nA. Every 3-4 weeks Not specified Depending on \nqualitative leaps \nforeward between \ntreatments - 73 - interviewees point out that osteopathy and acupuncture complement each other in a \nfavorable way (S.,  R., B., M.).  \nFurthermore they regard homeopathy as us eful complementary therapy. From S. \npoint of view homeopathy is particula rly recommendable in case of hormonally, \nmentally or nutritionally tr iggered migraine. For C., R., S. and B. testing out food \nintolerances and a subsequent dietary change can have opsitive influences on \nmigraine, too (Sahai-Srivastava 2008, M\u00fcller  2007, Gazerani 2003) . C. thinks that \nKneipp cures, foot baths, matrix tr eatments and cupping are recommendable \nadditional measures. A. cons iders breathing exercises and in this connection also \nsinging having positive effects on migraine. He  traces these effects back to the fact \nthat by means of breathing exercises and singing the tissue is better supplied with \noxygen. B. and S. regard Shiatsu and Ayurv eda as useful complementary therapies. \nM. pays special attention to posture and treat s postural defects, if necessary. In this \nconnection, P. suggests weight training in the gym. Additionally he recommends the intake of multivitamine supplements. M. and C. recommend psychotherapeutic \nmeasures if they have the f eeling that the pati ents are not able to come out of their \nproblematic situations on their own. In  this connection C. mentions family \nconstellations as one possible method.  \n \nDuring the interviews the osteopaths further more named several activities that, in \ntheir opinion, have negative effects on migrai ne. Regarding this C. lists massages \nand yoga, as well as crash diets (Fukui 200 8). S. also mentions the traditional \nmassage, too, and advises against active training in such a state of increased basic tension. B. considers infiltrations in to the suboccipital area problematic.  \n In this connection the statement s of P., in which he says that  from his point of view \ntherapies like acupuncture should be avoide d, are striking. He regards simultaneous \nwork in different systems as problematic.   \n4.7 Effectiveness of osteopathic treatments\n \nAll interviewees are convinced that ost eopathy is an effective therapeutic method for \nthe treatment of migrai ne patients.  P., B., A., C., S. and R. experienced that migraine \ncan be made disappear entirely by means of osteopathic treatment. (M. and S., - 74 - however, question this because they think it is not sure whether the osteopath meets \nthe patient ever again.)  M., on the other  hand thinks, that mi graine symptoms cannot \nbe healed but only alleviated. But all in terviewees agree that the osteopathic \ntreatment leads to a reduction of frequency and a decrease of intensity of migraine \nattacks. P. reports that he noticed that afte r the osteopathic treatment in some cases \nmigraine attacks transform into regularly occurring headaches. The following authors \nalso write about the positive effect of osteopathy on migraine: van Tintelon 2002, \nSpannbauer 2008, Gallagher 2005, Mueller 2007, Still 1910, Suther land 1930, Liem \n2001, Ligner 2008, Ecker 2003, Loza 1998.  For A. and C. psychic strain coming from the patient\u2019s environment can negatively \ninfluence the treatment. Furthermore B. stat es the treatment may remain inefficient \nas well if the patient does not collabor ate, e.g. if he/ she does not make \nrecommended dietary changes in case he suffe rs from migraine triggered by food \nintolerances. M. states that her treat ments of patients wit h hormonally triggered \nmigraine were not successful. By contrast, Ecker (2003) very well mentions successes concerning the treatment of  menstrually triggered migraine. \n \n4.8 Interaction therapist -patient\n \nOne part of the osteopaths interviewed (A., B., S. und R.) thinks that one has to be \nmore cautious when it comes to the treat ment of migraine pati ents as compared to \nthe treatment of other patients. This refers to the app lication of techniques on the one \nhand as well as to particular tactfulness in  dealing with the patients on the other \nhand. This corresponds to Tuche 1955, who th inks that due to the close interpersonal \nrelation that is established during osteopathi c treatments, the ost eopath is particularly \nqualified for the treatment of migraine patients as this cl ose relation satisfies the \nemotional needs of the patients in a psychological sense.  C. and P. consider it better \nnot to show too much delicacy. The pati ents should be rather motivated to balance \nwith their environment (C.) and to face rea lity (P.). M. does no t think particular \ncautiousness is demanded by migraine patients and relies on her osteopathic \nintuition, like always.  - 75 - In case of migraine patients it is very im portant to pay attenti on to every detail the \npatient talks about - especially for A. because th is allows him to give more individual \nand precise advice. B. thinks that special interaction is necessary because according to him the osteopath very much depends on t he patient\u2019s collaboration in such cases \nin order to be able to successfully treat the migraine. S. states that patients should \nbecome aware of the fa ctors that cause or stimulate migraine. \n5 Summary  \nI have tried to comprehensively and care fully describe the osteopaths\u2018 way of \nproceeding when it comes to the treatment of migraine patients \u2013 beginning with the \nmoment the patient enters the osteopath\u2019s office to the poi nt of time when therapy \nends. All interviews showed that migraine patients usually have suffered from the \ndisease for a long time and have been examined by conventional medical practitioners before consulting an osteopath. This is one of the core statements of my \ninvestigation.  Anamnesis and clinical examination do not di ffer from that of other patients. The \nclinical examination of migraine patients s howed that there are very often abnormities \nconcerning the upper cervical spine as well as concerning dural tension and a \nrestriction of mobility and/or motility of the liver. Due to  the holistic approach of the \nosteopaths, impacts on all systems (vascular, hormonal, neurochemic, myofascial, mental, structural etc.) can be found. T hese systems seem to influence each other \nmutually. My first hypothesis, which assumed that the treatment of  migraine patients \nmainly focuses on the craniosacral model , was not confirmed. In fact the \ninterviewees rather combine the craniosac ral model with the biodynamic model. This \nexpanded model proved to be useful for most of my interviewees.  \n Concerning the application of concrete techniques the interviewees named a large \nnumber of techniques, which makes it diffi cult to sift out whet her there are real \naccordances. A further difficulty hereby was that the osteopaths\u2018 definitions of \ntechniques and to which model they are a ssigned differ from one another. During the \ninterviews the importance of treatments according to the biodynamic model was \npointed out repeatedly.  - 76 - Concerning treatment intervals the osteopat hs tend to longer intervals in case of \nmigraine patients. According to my interv iewees the reason therefore is that the \nsystem of migraine patients is overwr ought anyway and thus a longer, unimpeded \nregeneration is necessary after the treatment.   All osteopaths agree that by means of t heir treatments they ar e able to achieve a \nreduction of frequency as well as an improvem ent of intensity of migraine attacks. \nThis can even lead to a total disappearance of the attacks. Thus my second hypothesis is confirmed. To listen carefu lly to what the patient says and to look \nclosely at what his/her body shows in  anamnesis and during the treatment is an \nefficient method to cater for his/her i ndividual needs. The osteopathic examination \nwith all its possibilities of examining all systems on all levels step by step is an \nefficient method of the clin ical investigation of migraine patients and very well \ncomplements the diagnosis from conventi onal medicine. The possibility to use \ndifferent models for the treatment of migraine patients, which can be adapted \nindividually to every patient and also be alte red from treatment to  treatment and even \nwithin one therapy session, enables t he osteopathy to conduct a successful \ntreatment even while deali ng with a disease pattern as complex as migraine.  \nFurthermore it proved important to give patients individual advice and to recommend \nadditional measures in order  to guarantee a lasting success. All experts agree on \nosteopathy being one of the mo st appropriate methods for treating migraine patients \nsuccessfully.   Finally I would like to name some points of  criticism and options for improvement of \nmy thesis. In my interviews I tried to ask the osteopaths about techniques of treatment. This proved difficult, becaus e osteopaths conceive and treat patients \nholistically, corresponding with the philoso phy of osteopathy (see chapter 2.8). \nThereby a single treatment technique accordi ng to a specific osteopathic model does \nnot stick out. Due to my lack of knowle dge concerning the biody namic model, it was \nalso difficult to conduct a target-aimed interview in this field. I did not focus \nsufficiently on this point while preparing fo r my qualitative investigation. Perhaps it \nwould have added an interesting diversificat ion, if I had included more than one \nphysician in my choice of interviewed expe rts. Thus I could have figured out whether \nthere are any differences in treatm ent depending on the osteopath being either a - 77 - physician or a physiotherapist in his basic profession. Furthermore this would have \nadded more clinical experience to my thesis.  \n6 Outlook  \nFor the future I would consider it important to prove the effectiveness of osteopathy in \nthe treatment of migraine usi ng large-scale clinical studi es. Hereto I could find only \nvery few corresponding works in literature.  Either there is a control group missing, \nwhich was assigned by random or the number of test persons was quite small, thus \nlimiting the expressiveness of  the study. However, this would be very important for \nosteopathy, in order to point  out our importance in the treatment and prevention of \nmigraine to conventional medicine. I tri ed to sum up the experience of osteopathic \nexperts in my qualitative study, in order to provide a basis for such studies in this \nfield.   - 78 -  - 79 - 7 Literature  \n1.
