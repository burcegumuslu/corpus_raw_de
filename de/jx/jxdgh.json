Solar power is also expected to increase significantly. In a power system, a continuous balance is maintained between total production and demand. This balancing is currently mainly managed with conventional power plants, but with larger amounts of wind and solar power, other sources will also be needed. Interesting possibilities include continuous control of wind and solar power, battery storage, electric vehicles, hydrogen production, and other demand resources with flexibility potential. The aim of this article is to describe and compare the different challenges and future possibilities in six systems concerning how to keep a continuous balance in the future with significantly larger amounts of variable renewable power production. A realistic understanding of how these systems plan to handle continuous balancing is central to effectively develop a carbon-dioxide-free electricity system of the future. The systems included in the overview are the Nordic synchronous area, the island of Ireland, the Iberian Peninsula, Texas (ERCOT), the central European system, and Great Britain.\n-\nPublication\n[Tree-structured Overlays with Minimal Height](/entities/publication/371399fd-6cb0-4289-af2a-5319c0c87fd8)( 2023-06-30) ;Laskowski, Patrick ;Bondorf, SteffenDistributed systems, potentially growing large and consisting of heterogeneous nodes, are advised to be constructed following the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networking paradigm. It becomes imperative that a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network is paired with efficient protocols for each phase of its life cycle: construction as well as maintenance and operation. Three operations are fundamental for a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network: nodes must be able to a) join, b) be located, c) leave. The main challenge for efficient protocols is that a single node will only possess limited information about the network, also known as the local view. In this paper, we present the minimal height tree overlay network (MINHTON), a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay architecture featuring several beneficial structural properties added over existing tree-structured networks. The minimal height guarantees a global tree balance, yet, it must be retained at all times, even though the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network may change dynamically. MINHTON provides efficient protocols for node Join and Departure, both retaining a minimal height tree. We show that the operations achieve performance in logarithmic order, comparable to tree overlays with less strict structural guarantees.\n-\nPublication\n[SOLA: A Decentralized Communication Middleware Developed with ns-3](/entities/publication/95fb0d5b-750f-483b-af1f-d2dfcf81f682)( 2023-06-28) ; ;G\u00f6deke, Jana ;T\u00f6nning, Lars ;Laskowski, Patrick ;H\u00f6rstrup, Maximilian ;Stolz, Oliver ;The transformation from static production facilities into a flexible and decentralized cyber-physical production system (CPPS) is part of the current ongoing Industry 4.0. A CPPS will enable and support communication between people, machines and virtual objects, e.g., as material flow or products, alike. However, communication in CPPS relies often on centralized approaches using a message broker or is not considered at all. We present in this paper the decentralized communication middleware called SOLA with an emphasis on, but not limited to, CPPS. SOLA uses the inherent given capability to communicate of participating nodes and eliminates the need for a central instance. A structured overlay network is created and managed, which appears to its users as a single coherent system. The main building blocks of SOLA are the management overlay and the event dissemination. Within this building blocks, no single peer has a global view and all operations are based on each peer's local view. The local view represents some selected links to a subset of all peers in the network. In addition to this, we also present how SOLA was developed with the help of the discrete-event simulator ns-3. Finally, we also show how we have used ns-3 to simulate a self-organizing material flow where participants use SOLA to communicate.\n-\nPublication\n[Evaluation of adjustment behaviour in a semi-supervised self-adjustment fine-tuning procedure for hearing aids](/entities/publication/a3456d90-8201-4843-8ec9-4493c77038dc)( 2023-04-20) ;G\u00f6\u00dfwein, Jonathan Albert ; ; ;Hildebrandt, AndreaObjective: This study investigated the adjustment behaviour of hearing aid (HA) users participating in a semi-supervised self-adjustment fine-tuning procedure for HAs. The aim was to link behaviour with the reproducibility and duration of the adjustments. Design: Participants used a two-dimensional user interface to identify their HA gain preferences while listening to realistic sound scenes presented in a laboratory environment. The interface allowed participants to adjust amplitude (vertical axis) and spectral slope (horizontal axis) simultaneously. Participants were clustered according to their interaction with the user interface, and their search directions were analysed. Study sample: Twenty older experienced HA users were invited to participate in this study. Results: We identified four different archetypes of adjustment behaviour (curious, cautious, semi-browsing, and full-on browsing) by analysing the trace points of all measurements for each participant. Furthermore, participants used predominantly horizontal or vertical paths when searching for their preference. Neither the archetype, nor the search directions, nor the participants\u2019 technology commitment was predictive of the reproducibility or the adjustment duration. Conclusions: The findings suggest that enforcement of a specific adjustment behaviour or search direction is not necessary to obtain fast, reliable self-adjustments. Furthermore, no strict requirements with respect to technology commitment are necessary.\n-\nPublication\n[Long-term stability of a life insurer\u2019s balance sheet](/entities/publication/2d3ecca9-f9ed-4f9e-9a0e-c02812ab502d)( 2023) ;Diehl, Maximilian ; ;Reetz, SusanneSass, J\u00f6rnIn this paper, we devise a stochastic asset\u2013liability management (ALM) model for a life insurance company and analyze its influence on the balance sheet within a low-interest rate environment. In particular, a flexible procedure for the generation of insurers\u2019 compressed contract portfolios that respects the given biometric structure is presented, extending the existing literature on stochastic ALM modeling. The introduced balance sheet model is in line with the principles of double-entry bookkeeping as required in accounting. We further focus on the incorporation of new business, i.e. the addition of newly concluded contracts and thus of insured in each period. Efficient simulations are obtained by integrating new policies into existing cohorts according to contract-related criteria. We provide new results on the consistency of the balance sheet equations. In extensive simulation studies for different scenarios regarding the business form of today\u2019s life insurers, we utilize these to analyze the long-term behavior and the stability of the components of the balance sheet for different asset\u2013liability approaches. Finally, we investigate the robustness of two prominent investment strategies against crashes in the capital markets, which lead to extreme liquidity shocks and thus threaten the insurer\u2019s financial health.\n-\nPublication\n[D6.1 - Key performance indicators for evaluation of proof-of-concepts](/entities/publication/4500b679-8c5f-4a74-a707-7282af13df0e)( 2023) ; ;Krakowski, VincentEsmaeili, Ali\n-\nPublication\n[Resource reconfiguration and optimization in brownfield constrained Robotic Assembly Line Balancing Problems](/entities/publication/4b5ee735-d25c-4991-a5e0-5410f42c4030)( 2023) ;Successful operation of an assembly line requires balancing work among resources and stations of the line to minimize costs, a problem known as the Assembly Line Balancing Problem (ALBP). Most work in literature considers new production facilities where no resources are available beforehand, known as a greenfield approach. However, reconfiguration required by volatile market demands necessitates assembly line and production capability changes. This reconfigurable production paradigm imposes new constraints on the ALBP. In this paper, we propose an integer-programming-based optimization for solving the dynamic resource reconfiguration for automatic assembly lines. We evaluate our approach on a newly developed multi-cost resource-constrained reconfiguration benchmark dataset, which includes information of an already existing line. Our model achieves, on average, a 1.9\u00d7 better total assembly line cost compared to an optimized greenfield approach. However, it compromises the number of workstations and line efficiency. This model attempts to enable reconfigurable production and decrease production costs in automatic assembly lines while increasing sustainability.\n-\nPublication\n[D3.3.2 - Concept for interregional virtual power plant coordination](/entities/publication/904ab49f-1d73-4b2a-bc74-a0cfa3156797)( 2023) ;Krakowski, Vincent ;Hemm, Regina\n-\nPublication\n[Optimizing the Marketing of Flexibility for a Virtual Battery in Day-Ahead and Balancing Markets: A Rolling Horizon Case Study](/entities/publication/cd0cd6e2-9e34-49ca-93d6-a57fd18646fd)( 2023) ; ;G\u00e4rtner, Christoph ; ; ; ;R\u00f6ger, Yukio EliasIndustrial electricity consumers with flexible demand can profit by adjusting their load to short-term prices and by providing balancing services to the grid. Markets which support this kind of short-term position adjustment are the day-ahead market and balancing markets. We propose a formulation for a combined optimization model that computes an optimal distribution of flexibility between the balancing and day-ahead markets. The optimal solution also includes the specific bids for the day-ahead and balancing markets. Besides the expected profits of each market and their individual bidding languages, our model also takes their different roles in a continuous marketing of flexibility into account. To prevent overrating short-term profits we introduce a variable penalty term that adds a cost to unfavorable load schedules. We evaluate the optimization model in a rolling horizon case study based on the setting of a virtual battery at TRIMET SE, which is derived from a flexible aluminum electrolysis process. For such a battery we compute a daily optimal split of flexibility and trading decisions based on data in the period 04/2021 - 03/2022. We show that the optimal split is more profitable than using only one market or a fixed split between the markets.\n-\nPublication\n[An Ether\u2010Based Low Density Electrolyte for the Use of Graphite Anodes in Stable Lithium\u2010Sulfur Batteries](/entities/publication/e9f04c82-b1da-45cd-a2f0-64aab90570e1)( 2023) ;Hoffmann, Florian ; ;M\u00fcller, Jannes ; ; ; ; ;Kwade, Arno ;Wu, Nae-LihLithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries represent an interesting technology due to the high theoretical capacity of sulfur and the low cost of the cathode material. Li-S cells with graphite electrodes could be an option for low-cost stationary energy storage as graphite is cheap and the electrode production process is well established. Unfortunately, in most Li-S electrolytes, graphite is not stable due to solvent co-intercalation and degrades fast. In this work, a new low density electrolyte based on hexyl methyl ether (HME) and 1,3-dioxalane (DOL) is presented, which allows to use graphite as anode material for Li-S batteries. In symmetric graphite vs. graphite cells an averaged Coulombic efficiency of 99.94% per electrode could be reached. For the first time, cycling conditions like voltage window and balancing were optimized for Li-S cells with graphite anodes and the suitability of the concept could be demonstrated in multilayer pouch
