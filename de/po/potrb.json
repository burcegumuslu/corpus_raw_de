At the end, 37 patients completed the post-test. From those 37 patients, 16 had chosen the karate training, 9 the dance training and 12 the waiting control group. Before and after the whole training phase cognitive performance, emotional well-being and balance were measured. The results showed that both, karate and dance training groups, improved balance. Furthermore, the mood dropped only in the waiting control group receiving no training at all, whereas it remained stable in patients who attended the karate and dance group. The training adherence was higher in the karate than the dance group indicating a high acceptability in PD patients for karate. In sum, karate can have the same positive effects as dance for PD patients. Further studies with larger samples and more rigorous methodologies are required to investigate the reported effects in more detail.\nKeywords: Parkinson, karate, line dance, standard dance, cognitive function, motor functions, emotional well-being\ninTr ODU c T i O n\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is determined by the cardinal symptoms bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, \ndifficulties in balance, and resulting difficulties in gait. This impaired motor performance sometimes has a detrimental effect on the quality of life, because it may be accompanied by emotional disorders like depression or anxiety (\n1\n). Up to 57% of PD patients develop cognitive impairments in the first \n3\u20135\u00a0 years after diagnosis (\n2\n). Thus it is evident that PD is a holistic disorder. Furthermore, it is \nestimated that worldwide, at least four million people in total receive the diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease (\n3\n). According to Zhou et\u00a0al. it is expected that the number of PD patients will rise to the \nnumber of 4.94 million in 2030 merely in China (\n4\n). Due to this prognosis it is crucial to find alterna-\ntive therapy concepts to enhance the quality of life of PD patients. One of these concepts includes sports and movement programs.\nParkinson Disease and s ports\nSeveral studies showed the positive influence of sport training on motor symptoms of PD patients. \nShulman et\u00a0al., for example, proved that endurance as well as strength and flexibility improved by a treadmill, strength and flexibility training (\n5\n). Lauz\u00e9 et\u00a0al. indicated in a review that physical activ-\nity has promising effects on physical capacities (e.g., lower and upper limb strength or endurance) \nbrought to you by CORE View metadata, citation and similar papers at core.ac.uk\nprovided by University of Regensburg Publication Server2Dahmen-Zimmer and Jansen\nKarate and Dance in PD\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org December 2017 | Volume 4 | Article 237\nand physical and cognitive functional aspects like for example \ngait or mobility (6). According to the review of Lauz\u00e9 et\u00a0al. (6), \npsychosocial aspects of life revealed the least potential for an \nimprovement through physical activity. This result is in contrast to a study of Cusso et\u00a0al. who revealed that non-motor symptoms \nin PD patients like depression, apathy, fatigue, and sleep disorders \nwere significantly improved by physical activity (7). Most of the 20 \nstudies included in their review used aerobic programs instead of, \nfor example, strength or flexibility programs. Furthermore, due to the different measurement instruments results are difficult to \ncompare across studies. In the present study, two specific move-\nment forms were investigated in more detail, namely, dance and martial arts. Both of them and their possible enhancing effects on \ndifferent symptoms in PD patients are presented in the following \nin more detail.\nParkinson\u2019s Disease and Dance\nDance seems to be an appropriate movement form to be applied in PD patients because it strengthens the muscle of the lower extremities (8) and improves balance which reduces the risk to fall \n(9). In a meta-analysis regarding the influence of tango argentine \non Parkinson\u2019s disease motor systems improved. Furthermore, \nthere was a tendency for life quality to be improved and participa-\ntion in social activities was augmented (10). In one pilot study, the influence of an unspecific dance training (N\u00a0 =\u00a015) was compared \nto a normal sport training (N\u00a0 =\u00a017) and a waiting control group \n(N\u00a0=\u00a014) (11). The training lasted 60\u00a0min for 12\u00a0weeks. The dance \ngroup improved its motor performance, visual\u2013spatial cognition \n(reaction time in mental rotation), and emotional parameters \n(e.g., self-rating depression scale). Summarizing the results, the effect of dance on the patients\u2019 motor systems was stronger than \nthe effect on cognition and emotion.\nPD and Martial arts\nMost studies which showed an improving effect of martial arts \non PD are related to TaiChi, an old Chinese martial art. TaiChi \nincludes a series of slow, meditative movements for self-defense, \nand for the accomplishment of inner peace and calm. Several studies showed a positive effect on motor systems such as balance \n(12). In another meta-analysis, the authors could not prove an \nimprovement of quality of life (13), a result which was confirmed \nby a review of Zou and co-workers (4).\nUntil now, there is no study which investigates the effect of \na karate training on PD patients. Karate is a martial art, which entails moving forward and backward while performing arm \nmovements. Up to this point, there are only three studies inves-\ntigating the effect of karate on cognitive, motor, and emotional \nsymptoms in older people. Mui\u00f1os and Ballesteros showed an increased dynamic visual acuity in older people who trained \nkarate compared to sedentary controls (14). Visual acuity is a \nmarker of perceptual processing speed. Jansen and Dahmen-\nZimmer (15) presented the result that older adults (67\u201393\u00a0years) \nwho just began with the karate training improved their emotional well-being. This result was obtained in comparison to an inactive \ncontrol group. No cognitive enhancement could be confirmed. \nIn a new study, Jansen et\u00a0al. found an improvement in subjective mental health and anxiety as well as cognitive processing speed for a karate group, but not a mindfulness-based stress reduction group and a control group (16). In this study 55 healthy par -\nticipants between the age of 52 and 81 took part and the training lasted for 8\u00a0weeks.\ngoal of this study\nIt is the first goal of this study to investigate if it is feasible to perform a karate training with PD patients. This provided, we \nfurther want to explore if karate as well as dance can improve \nemotional, cognitive as well as motor performance in patients with PD compared to an inactive control group. Third, by con-\nducting an applied study and by giving the patients the opportu-\nnity to choose the kind of movement they like we want to mirror \na real-life situation. We expect males to prefer a karate training \nand females to prefer a dance training.\nMaTerials anD MeThODs\nParticipants\nIn total, 65 patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Y ahr stages 1\u20133) were recruited for participation through a \nnewspaper announcement and with the help of a neurologist. \nAccording to our former studies (15), it was our target that 36\u201345 patients participated until the posttest, 12\u201315 in each group. The \nrecruitment took place in spring 2016 and the experimental \ninterventions were performed between August 2016 and March \n2017. At the end, 37 patients completed the posttest. From \nthose 37 patients, 16 had chosen the karate training, 9 the dance training and 12 the waiting control group. The patients of the \nwaiting control group could not or did not want to attend an \nexperimental group at this time. They were offered to join the karate or dance group after they had completed the intervention. \nAll participating patients denied to actually suffer from the fol-\nlowing diseases: osteoporosis, lumbar diseases, cardio pulmonary \ndiseases, or cancer. All patients got consent from their physicians \nto take part in this study. The three groups did not differ in age, F(2,34)\u00a0 =\u00a00.523, n.s., \n\u03b7p20030=., but according to the percentage \nof females and males, \u03c72(2,N\u00a0=\u00a037)\u00a0 =\u00a08.3, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05. The study was \napproved by the Ethical committee of the German Association of \nPsychology. All Patients gave written informed consent according \nto the ethical declaration of Helsinki. In the intervention groups, some of the attending healthy partners took part (karate group, \nN\u00a0=\u00a08; dance group, N\u00a0 =\u00a04), but only the data of the patients were \nanalyzed.\nMaterials\nDemographic Data\nDemographic data were assessed concerning the age, sex, and the \nphysical activity (yes/no). The highest school/university degree \nwas also measured (1\u00a0 =\u00a010\u00a0years of education; 2\u00a0 =\u00a010\u00a0years of \neducation and a further higher education; 3\u00a0 =\u00a0university degree). \nAdditionally, the participants were asked to mention any other illnesses and medication in an open text field (see Table\u00a01).\nEmotional Variables\nSubjective well-being was measured with the Multidimensional \nMood Questionnaire (17). This measurement includes 24 items TaBle 1 | Demographic data dependent on the training group.\nKarate (n\u00a0=\u00a016) Dance (n\u00a0=\u00a09) control (n\u00a0=\u00a012) \u03c72 (df\u00a0=\u00a02) p\nSex (male, female) 13, 3 6, 3 8, 4 8.39 0.015\nAge (M, SD) 68.87 (7.24) 72.33 (6.69) 70.42 (10.07) 0.523a0.597\nPhysical activity (yes/no) 7/9 4/5 6/6 0.119 0.942\nSchool education (low/middle/high) 5/4/7 2/6/1 8/4/0 12.52 0.014\nSession of training (M, SD) 25.15 (5.48) 20.67 (5.31) 3.89a0.061\naF-statistic of univariate analysis of variance.\n3\nDahmen-Zimmer and Jansen\nKarate and Dance in PD\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org December 2017 | Volume 4 | Article 237with a 5-point rating scale each. The following subscales were \nintegrated: Mood (elevated vs. depressed mood), Fatigue (wake-\nfulness vs. sleepiness), and Alertness (calmness vs. restlessness). \nCronbach\u2019s Alpha varied between 0.86 and 0.94.\nAnxiety and depression were measured with the Hospital \nAnxiety and Depression Scale [HADS; (18, 19)] as well as the \nCEDS Depression Scale (20). The HADS consists of 14 items. Scores under 7 are unremarkable, scores between 8 and 10 are \nmarginal noticeable. Cronbach\u2019s alpha varied between 0.73 for \nanxiety and 0.78 for depression. With the help of the CEDS the symptoms of fatigue, hopelessness, demotion of oneself, dejec-\ntion, loneliness, sadness, listlessness, fear, etc. could be analyzed. \nA score over 23 counts as a sign of a possible depression. Split-half reliability is 0.81.\nSubjective health was analyzed with the 12-item Short-Form \nHealth Survey (21), measuring physical as well as mental health. \nThis scale was valid in association with other physical and mental \nhealth measurements.\nGeneral self-efficacy was investigated with the Short Scale of \nGeneral Self-Efficacy (22). This scale includes three items with a 5-point rating scale. Cronbach\u2019s alpha varied between 0.81 and 0.86.\nCognitive Variables\nCognitive processing speed as well as executive function were measured with the Number Connection Test. In this test, par -\nticipants have to connect numbers (1\u201390) printed randomly on a sheet of paper. The test consists of six sheets of paper, two practice sheets and four test sheets. The numbers have to be connected \nas fast and as accurately as possible in the right order. The mean \ntime of the four test trials is calculated. The test\u2013retest reliability \nis 0.95 (23).\nGeneral cognitive ability was measured with the Parkinson \nNeuropsychometric Dementia Assessment (PANDA). This scale includes a task of pair association, word fluency, visual\u2013spatial \ncognition, working memory, delayed retrieval, and assesses mood ( 24). The five cognitive tests have a specificity of 91% and \na sensitivity of 77% for patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. In this study, we focused on the analysis of the cognitive score.\nMotor Variables\nBalance was measured with the one-leg stand. Here, patients were required to stand on one leg as long as possible, but at least for \n60\u00a0s. Patients should cross their arms in front of their chests and \nfix some point in the room. The experimenter took the time the \npatients were able to stand on one leg. The best of three trials was \ntaken for the analysis (25).Procedure\nEach training took place once a week for 1\u00a0h and in a separate room. The whole trainings phase lasted for 30\u00a0weeks. The train-\ners registered the training attendance of each patient and the \nattending partner. The mean attendance of the dance training was 20.67\u00a0h and the one of karate training 25.15, see Table\u00a01.\nDeutscher Karate Verband (DKV) Karate\nThe karate group received a Shotokan karate training according to the German Karate Federation. This kind of training involves \nthe elements of Kihon, Kumite, and Kata. The training began \nwith a short warm-up followed by the learning and exercising of some specific arm and leg movements (Kihon), sessions with a \npartner (Kumite), and the learning of sequences of movements \n(Kata). Kata are the most elaborated exercises because different movements have to be remembered in a prescribed order. The \ntraining further involved breathing exercises, strong and soft, and \nslow and fast movements. It ended with a short relaxation phase. There were three experienced trainers (two males, one female) \nwith more than 20\u00a0years of practice and more than 10\u00a0years of \nteaching experience. They rotated in their teaching activities.\nDance\nThe dance sessions included simple dance movements which were compounded to a choreography and danced together in a \nline, i.e., elements of line dance were integrated. Later, standard \ndance forms such as rumba and waltz, were applied. Three dif-ferent dance trainers (two males and one female) with several \nyears of experience taught the dance lessons. They rotated in their \nteaching activities.\nThe rotation of trainers was welcomed by all patients in both \ngroups. The tests were applied 1\u00a0week before the specific train-ing started and again 1\u00a0week after the last training session. Each \ntest session lasted around on hour. The tests were conducted by \npsychological research assistants.\nstatistical analysis\nThe categorical data were analyzed with chi-square tests, see Table\u00a01 . To investigate the relation between cognitive, emotional, \nand motor performance, a correlation analysis was conducted independent of group with only the most relevant cognitive, motor, and emotional tests: the cognitive score of the PANDA, the \nresults of the depression scale and the self-efficacy, and the per -\nformance in the one-leg stand. For metric-dependent variables, analyses of variance (ANOV As) were performed. Group served \nas a between-subjects factor (KG, DG, WKG) and time (pretest FigUre 1 | Points in the mood measurement in the MDBF (in the pretest \nand posttest) for the karate, dance and waiting control group.\n4Dahmen-Zimmer and Jansen\nKarate and Dance in PD\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org December 2017 | Volume 4 | Article 237\nand posttest) as a within-subject factor. Thus, for the investigation \nof the effect of karate or dance training compared to the waiting \ncontrol group on emotional well-being, cognitive functioning, \nand balance, we conducted 3\u00a0 \u00d7\u00a02 repeated-measures ANOV As. \nSignificance levels were set at \u0251\u00a0 =\u00a00.05. Because one focus of the \nstudy lay on the feasibility of karate and dance in PD patients and due to clarity reasons, we will present only the (marginally) \nsignificant results in the following Section \u201cResults. \u201d\nresUl Ts\nadherence rate\nIn the karate group, there were 25 patients at the beginning and 16 \ncompleted the posttest. Nine patients did not complete the study \ndue to private reason (1), health complaints (4), time constraints \n(2), death (1), or relocation (1). In the dance training group, 12 patients started with the training and 3 of them left it before \nthe posttest due to health complaints (1), time constraints (1), \nand no interest (1). From the waiting control group, 18 patients \ncompleted the pretest but only 12 appeared again to complete the \nposttest. The remaining six patients did not give any reason for not showing up.\ncorrelational analysis\nThe correlational analysis showed a significant positive relation between the performance in the one-leg stand and the self-efficacy \n(r\u00a0=\u00a00.398, p\u00a0=\u00a00.015) and a negative relation between the balance \nperformance and the depression value (r\u00a0 =\u00a0\u22120.407, p\u00a0=\u00a00.010). A \nbetter balance performance is related to a higher self-efficacy and a minor depression rate.\nemotional Well-being\nSubjective Well-being\nMDBF Mood\nThe repeated-measure analysis yielded a significant main effect \nof \u201ctime, \u201d F(1,34)\u00a0 =\u00a0 12.29, p\u00a0=\u00a0 0.001, \u03b7p20266=. , a marginally \nsignificant effect of the factor \u201cgroup, \u201d F(2,34)\u00a0 =\u00a02.67, p\u00a0=\u00a00.083, \n\u03b7p20136=. and a significant interaction between both factors, \nF(2,34)\u00a0 =\u00a0 4.003, p\u00a0=\u00a0 0.027, \u03b7p20191=..

Significance \nlevel was set to p\u00a0=\u00a00.025 because of multiple testing.\nThe MDBF subscales fatigue and agitation did not receive any \nsignificant result.\nDepression and anxiety\nConcerning the analysis of the HADS and the subscale of depres-sion, the repeated-measure analysis yielded only a significant \neffect of the factor \u201cgroup, \u201d F(2,34)\u00a0 =\u00a0 3.86, p\u00a0=\u00a0 0.031, \n\u03b7p20185=.. \nBonferroni-corrected multiple comparisons indicated that the KG group (M\u00a0 =\u00a04.87, SD\u00a0 =\u00a02.96) had a smaller score than the \nWCG (M\u00a0 =\u00a07.62, SD\u00a0 =\u00a02.2) (p\u00a0 =\u00a00.031). There was no effect in relation to the DG (M\u00a0 =\u00a06.67, SD\u00a0 =\u00a02.61). The result of the HADS \ndepression subscale was confirmed by the ADS analysis, yield-\ning only a significant effect of the factor \u201cgroup, \u201d F(2,34)\u00a0 =\u00a03.97, \np\u00a0=\u00a00.028., \n\u03b7p20189=..

There was no \ndifference between the DG and WCG. The HADS subscale of anxiety revealed no effect at all.\nsubjective health (sF-12)\nFor the physical score, there was no significant main effect at \nall. The analysis of the mental score yielded only a significant \neffect of the factor \u201cgroup, \u201d F(2,34)\u00a0 =\u00a04.85, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014, \u03b7p20051=.. \nBonferroni-corrected multiple comparisons showed that the KG group (M\u00a0 =\u00a046.25, SD\u00a0 =\u00a09.97) showed a higher score than the \nWCG (M\u00a0 =\u00a035.39, SD\u00a0 =\u00a07.54) (p\u00a0 =\u00a00.012). There was no effect in \nrelation to the DG (M\u00a0=\u00a040.07, SD\u00a0=\u00a09.98).\nself-efficacy\nThe results showed simply a significant group effect, F(2,34)\u00a0 =\u00a0 9.47, \np\u00a0=\u00a0 0.001, \u03b7p20358=..

Significance level was set \nto p\u00a0=\u00a00.025 due to multiple testing.\nThe one-leg stand test was performed for mostly 60s, and \nthereafter terminated. In the KG, already 37.5% participants achieved this score in the pretest. No participant of the DG and 16.7% of the WCG achieved this score. Because of this \u201cceiling \neffect, \u201d no additional improvement could be measured for these \npersons in the posttest.\nDiscUssiOn\nRegarding our first goal, it was shown that it is possible to conduct karate with PD patients. Furthermore, karate seemed to be more \nattractive for male patients compared to females: more males \nchose to attend a karate session compared to a dance session. Furthermore, the self-selection of the type of sport resulted in the \nfact that more patients with a higher school degree chose karate, an effect which might be mediated by the higher attendance of males \nin this group. Moreover, the karate group showed higher scores \nin some of the pretests than the other groups. Especially in the \none-leg stand test more than one third of the karate participants started with the highest score possible. Therefore, it is impossible \nto demonstrate their improvement (ceiling effect). Concerning \nthe results of this feasibility study, no difference between the effect \nof karate or dance on emotional, cognitive, or motor performance \nwas found. Both interventions showed an improvement in bal-ance as well as a prevention of mood drops. Another interesting \nresult was that emotional, cognitive, and motor parameters relate \nto each other, suggesting a holistic approach when dealing with treatment of PD.\nIn addition, the study clearly proves a high treatment adher -\nence, especially in the karate training, which might be an indi-\ncator for the high acceptability in PD patients. Because other \nkinds of therapies, such as long-term medication, suffer from a lower adherence (26), the karate training has the potential to \nbe accepted as a complementary therapy. This is the first study \nto provide evidence that karate is an appropriate training to \nimprove balance in PD patients. This is in line with the claim of Morgan and Fox that exercise is increasingly recognized as \nimportant tool to combat impairment of motor systems in PD \npatients (27). Furthermore, compared to the inactive control \ngroup, no decline of emotional well-being took place in the \nkarate group. This result relates to the karate study with older people showing a training effect of karate on self-related mental \nhealth ( 16) and indicates that in PD patients karate may also \nbe appropriate to maintain emotional well-being while living \nwith PD. One reason for this might be that karate gives the \nopportunity to train in a group with respect, and without com-\npetition, which maintains the highly relevant feeling of social support. As another likely reason self-esteem could improve. \nMoreover, an enhancement of some spiritual insight could \nresult in calmness of mind. The enhancement of the spiritual \ninsight is in line with positive effects of mindfulness training in \nclinical interventions (28).\nThe influence of Dance on Balance and \nMood in PD Patients\nThe specific dance training applied in this study, a combination \nof line dance and standard dance, showed an improvement in \nbalance as well as a stable state of emotional well-being compared \nto the inactive waiting control group. This is in accordance with Earhart\u2019s claiming that dance can be a clinically meaningful \ntherapy for individuals with PD (29). This result is also in line with \nthe meta-analysis investigating the effects of argentine tango on \nPD patients, demonstrating the positive effect on motor behavior \n(10). One benefit of dance might be the effect of cueing, which is mostly auditory, but can also be visual or somatosensory. With \nthe help of this cueing the movement gets facilitated. This is in \naccordance with studies showing that rhythmic auditory stimula-tion is helpful to improve walking performance in patients with \nPD ( 30). Furthermore, the stable state of emotional well-being \nfound in this study confirms the results of Lewis et\u00a0al. indicating an overall reduction on emotional discomfort (31).6Dahmen-Zimmer and Jansen\nKarate and Dance in PD\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org December 2017 | Volume 4 | Article 237\nno effects on cognition for Karate and \nDance\nIn contrast to some other studies, for example the dance study \nof Natale et\u00a0al., we did not find any significant improvements for \ncognitive functions (32). One reason for this might be specific \ntests used in our study, i.e., the PANDA and some sort of trail making test for cognitive speed and executive functions. In other \nstudies showing positive effects, executive functions are investi-\ngated in more detail (32). The non-significant effects of karate \ntraining on cognition are in line with the study of Jansen and \nDahmen-Zimmer in older people (mean age: 78\u00a0years), but con-tradict the study of Jansen et\u00a0al. (16), who found an improvement \nin the processing speed of older people (mean age: 63\u00a0years). Both \nstudies differ in the mean age of the participants, so we might ten-tatively assume that an improvement of cognition with a Karate \ntraining is easier to achieve with participants before the end of \ntheir professional life. Concerning the positive effect of dance on \ncognition, Kattenstroth et\u00a0al. report an improvement on cognitive \nfunctions after healthy individuals (mean age: 68\u00a0years) joined a dance training for six\u00a0months (33). Again, the individuals were \nhealthy and under 70\u00a0years old.\nlimitation and chances\nThe present investigation serves as a pilot and feasibility study \nexploring the potential benefits of karate as another promising \nexercise tool in the treatment of PD. The study is limited by \nthe fact, that a randomization is missing, because the patients were free to choose the form of exercise they liked to do. This \nexperimental setting was selected to enhance the validity of the \nstudy. It is quite unlikely that patients might be motivated to take \npart committedly in a motor training they do not like. One might \nsuspect that this would result in a high number of drop-outs and/or and unreliable results. On the other hand, we could not exclude \nthat the obtained effects are biased by a preference effect. We gained \ninteresting information, that is males like to choose karate while females chose dance. Also, the patients who choose karate seem \nto have a better physical and mental health as the patients of the \nother two groups. The statistical analysis was impeded by these \nfacts. It is also uncommon to invite the partners to take part in \nthe intervention group. This limited internal validity but raised ecological validity. In this manner, a reasonable compromise \nbetween a high internal and external validity was implemented \nin this study. Another limitation is the fairly small number of participating patients.Future research and clinical Practice\nThis is the first study showing that karate might be a positive treat-ment method for the emotional, cognitive, and motor symptoms \nof PD patients. The advantage of this study lies in the investiga-\ntion of the impact of karate and dance on body, emotion, and cognition. However, more studies with a bigger sample size and \nclear randomization have to be conducted. It may also be useful \nto investigate the effect of different karate postures as well as the \nrole of the patients\u2019 partners in the dance group in more detail.\nConcerning the clinical practice, we can assume that it is \nuseful for the PD patients to choose the physical training they like the most. If they get the general allowance of their neurolo-\ngist, they are able either to attend an adapted karate or a dance training. Both adapted training forms should be considered as \nnon-medicinal additional therapy beside medicinal treatment.\neThics sT aTeMenT\nThe study was approved by the Ethical committee of the German \nAssociation of Psychology, spring 2016.\naUThOr cOnTriBUTiOns\nKD-Z: conception of the work; acquisition and interpretation of the data: surveillance of the interventions; drafting the work, \nrevising it critically; final approval of the version to be published; \nagreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work.
