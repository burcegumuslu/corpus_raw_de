Teh-Fu Tan (Taiwan / USA) revolutionized acupuncture worldwide.\nHis method, which emerges from a lifelong study of traditional Chinese medicine and the ancient Chinese texts, often has an immediate effect when the acupuncture needle is inserted in pain syndromes.\nThe combination of different acupuncture systems for dynamic YIN / YANG balancing is characteristic of his method.\nThe acupuncture needles are placed contralaterally and distally, mostly not at the local point of the pain itself, the needles remain in place for 30-45 minutes, in exceptional cases longer.\nDr. R. Tan taught his method worldwide for over 25 years and ran his own clinic in San Diego (USA).\nDr. Tan passed away in 2016, but I will always remember him as one of my greatest teachers.

I was lucky enough to get to know him very personally and because of his immense wealth of knowledge and humor ... the memory of him remains and lives.\nClinical application:\n- All pain syndromes (acute and chronic)\n- Lumbago, sciatica, blockages of the cervical / thoracic spine / lumbar spine\n- Sensitivity disorders: numbness, tingling, burning, itching, cramps, etc.\n- Migraine\n- Asthma\n- Allergies\n- Gynecological complaints, hormone fluctuations, desire to have children\n- Impotence\n- Autoimmune diseases\nTreatment principles:\nI went\n1.
