One of the key questions is how Swiss schools can become more inclusive as well as how school can enhance e.g. socioeconomic and health approaches to better prepare students for their life in society. This report includes the findings of a qualitative foundational research, which is supposed to prepare a knowledge basis for the quantitative study. Above all, it helps to better understand the challenges and needs of various stakeholders in Swiss schools. The study thus covers findings from French- and German speaking politicians, principals, teachers, parents and students across main school types. The qualitative foundational research at hand focuses on the following questions: \u2022In how far do school help students to be prepared for life in society? Which meta-skills seem most important from the different stakeholder\u2019s views? \u2022What are the roles, needs and possible barriers of different stakeholders to support students to develop meta-skills? What would help them?  \u2022Which measures best fit the problem areas and how should they be designed? Which interventions would be supported?  In addition, the baseline study should create trust in the following long-term study by the Jacobs Center for Productive Youth Development, so that the willingness to participate in quantitative studies can be increased.

Later on, meta-skills are refined, and become an (important) by-product of professional skills.  \u2022While it is impossible to have a ranking of meta-skills, we found some gaining importance  over time, e.g. dealing with stress, resilience, adaptability, creativity, source criticism and  IT-knowledge, and social skills, which are often perceived as decreasing, and thus getting  more in focus. \u2022Many students also seem to need more support in dealing with stress, resisting  temptations (esp. with regard to social/digital media) and leading a healthy lifestyle.ROLES OF STAKEHOLDERS \u2022The extend to which meta-skills can be conveyed and learned depends on the very individual  context of each student. Parental resources (their time, education and financial resources)  play a major role for the set of meta skills that students possess when they enter school. \u2022While professional and methodological skills are traditionally allocated to the school\u2019s area of  responsibility, all stakeholders agree that the responsibility to convey social- and self-skills  shifted from the parental- to the schools\u2019 area of responsibility: schools need to compensate  what\u2019s beyond the parents\u2019 remedy. \u2022In how far schools can manage to cope with this strongly depends on the individual resources  of the school (i.e. motivation of the stakeholders, financial- and human resources, infrastructure,  resources of the pupils themselves and their parents).  \u2022A sphere of vacuum showed, created by social/digital media, where parents and teachers  have little to no influence and control \u2013 and which showed to be a source of stress and distraction in the students daily lives.   \u2022Students are in line with the other stakeholders when it comes to the perceived importance of meta-skills. Their descriptions show that dealing with stress and (social and performance) pressure is very important to them and that school is not perceived as equally helpful to learn this skill.SUMMARY (I)\nP19140_Final Report_School as preparation for life in society10EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITIES\u2022The more the stakeholder is directly involved in situations where inequality could occur  (i.e. the students themselves, their parents, the teachers), the less it is visible for them.  \u2022Most stakeholders agree that right from the start, the family resources play a major role  for inequal chances, while schools are predominantly seen as compensating factors.  Politicians and principals more likely question if schools can really compensate or if there is a  lot of work to be done, still. \u2022When it comes to inequality on the labour market, stakeholders agree again that equality of  chances is clearly not given.      NEEDS AND INTERVENTIONS\u2022Most stakeholders showed general openness towards interventions, especially if measurable  data could be gained, which could then have a positive effect on future measures in the  Swiss school system.  \u2022However, it will be a challenge to find a balance between far-reaching interventions  (e.g. with impact on the starting position of students at a very early, i.e. pre-school stage) and  rather simple measures with less profound impacts. \u2022Also, there are quite a few aspects to be considered for the optimal intervention stakeholders  pointed out that some of the interventions do not seem very new/innovative or that  they could cause resistance if implemented without a close collaboration between the  institution and the persons concerned (e.g. teachers or parents).SUMMARY (II)\nGIM | RELEVANCE COUNTS.\nP19140_Final Report_School as preparation for life in society11Study Design & Sample Summary Meta-Skills   Roles of stakeholders  Equality of opportunities Needs and interventions Agenda  P19140_Final Report_School as preparation for life in society12META-SKILLS | RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN META SKILLS AND PROFESSIONAL SKILLSEspecially with younger students, professional skills require a base of meta-skills.

Children should learn to draw conclusions from mistakes and thus be able to continuously optimize their learning process. Importance of the ability increases with age, but esp. teachers emphasize that already for students at kindergarten age it\u2018s possible to reflect their own behaviour. An open, accepting atmosphere and a positive approach towards errors are important prerequisites for working on this competence. Teachers, principals and politicians occasionally express that reflection is very prominent in the current curriculum and that working on this skill is not necessary in every context.META-SKILLS | SELF-COMPETENCE: REFLEXIONREFLEXION\n\u00abF\u00fcr mich ist ein Klassenrat was ganz Wichtiges.

Self-control and persistence are becoming particularly important from primary school age onwards. In kindergarten, teachers don\u2019t put much focus on it as some teachers state that self-control is being practiced anyway, when children perform a self-chosen task. Some students perceive school as helpful regarding the acquisition of this competence (e.g. because of good teachers or the general setting in school), whereas many others think that they have learned this at home, especially in the context of tasks that are of particular interest to them.

Parents and students emphasize that it\u2019s not only important to learn how to control emotions but also to understand and express them. Additionally, they find it important to adapt the own behaviour according to the context. Students state that school did not play a major role in the acquisition of the competence.

Some students report that they seldom feel stressed out at school, but for many others, exams, poor grades, homework and long school days are a huge source of stress.

At higher school levels, the main focus is on addictive substances and media use. In addition to promoting a healthy lifestyle, some teachers and principals of higher school levels also find it important to allow yourself to indulge from time to time. Students are only partially aware of the school\u2019s contribution for a healthy lifestyle and many of them would approve an even stronger commitment. Students find it particularly difficult to resist temptations from their mobile phones and other media; in the area of nutrition the picture is mixed.

Colleagues or friends at school are also used for informational support, if e.g. a task is not understood. Teachers  Source of informational support, but not for all\nTeachers are primarily asked for help when it comes to school-related problems (e.g. understanding of tasks), and are also perceived as helpful. For private/emotional topics they are mostly not asked for help. Some students generally would hesitate to ask their teachers.Parents Emotional/instrumental source for some\nParents often provide emotional support by  comforting, encouraging and helping to find solutions. They often give instrumental support (e.g. organise a tutor). The mother is mentioned more often by both girls and boys than the father and plays a very important role for many.

Failures are mostly attributed internally. \u2022According to the parents, all students are equally supported at school, but injustice prevails in later working life.  \u2022Teachers are aware of inequalities according to family background of students and try to counteract as best they can. \u2022Principals see inequalities based on the family background, but are much more skeptical if the school is able to compensate for the disadvantage connected to it. \u2022Politicians look at the school system from the outside and while emphasizing that school does a lot against injustice, they are most aware of systematic injustices.INEQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITIES | PERCEPTION OF STAKEHOLDERS Discrimination at school seems to occur very subtly and on the basis of more differentiated characteristics and is therefore not easily decodable.

I would say a broad data base.\u00bb  (Regierungsrat, FDP)InterventionsBroad foundation \n\u00abThere are not clearly measurable factors and one cannot find THE truth. That is why it is great when you try to find empirical data. That will certainly bring us further.\u00bb  (Regierungsrat, FDP)Measurable findings\u00abI think that's basically good.

That's always better than just theory. \u00bb  (Bildungsrat, parteilos)Appreciation\u00abThe people who work with the intervention at school, the teachers, must be must be involved in decision-making and implementation and have a say.

Some would also support mandatory participation to reach families with very low time- and financial resources.Relieve schools and parents, prevent students from being at a disadvantage when entering school.More autonomy for principals with regard to school subjects and their weight in school. Enable to better respond to the needs of students.More flexibility for principals and teachers with regard to school times and teaching structure, e.g. replacing early morning lectures with podcast lessons which can be done independent of space and time.Prepare students for flexible working structures, self-organization, help students cope with fatigue better.Put focus on professional schools and think about interventions how to improve it in general.Reduce drop-out rates from apprenticeship, enhance the image of apprenticeships.P19140_Final Report_School as preparation for life in society67MANY THANKS!Project lead  Marieke W\u00fcnsche Senior project manager \nSupervision Carola Eichman  Head of qualitative Research\nProject management  Tanja Gerig Project Assistant  \n", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
