For light elements, however, relativistic effects are usually so small that they can safely be neglected in most quantum-chemical calculations. Nevertheless, remaining discrepancies between accurate non-relativistic calculations and experimental results can be in a couple of cases attributed to relativistic effects. One means of incorporating relativistic effects in theoretical approaches is perturbation theory. In the present work, the perturbative mass-velocity-Darwin approach as well as direct perturbation theory have been employed. In both approaches, the first- order energy correction due to relativity can be obtained as an analytical derivative of the energy with respect to a relativistic perturbation parameter. In order to determine the equilibrium structure of a molecule, the forces acting on the various nuclei are required. The relativistic contribution to these forces are determined by mixed second derivatives of the energy with respect to the relativistic perturbation parameter and the displacements of the various nuclei. In this work, the relativistic corrections to energy and forces were incorporated in the quantum-chemical program package ACES2 for different electronic-structure approaches including Hartree-Fock theory, second-order M\u00f8ller-Plesset perturbation theory, and various coupled-cluster methods. The basis-set dependence of the relativistic contributions to energies, structural parameters, and harmonic vibrational frequencies were studied in detail. For the molecules investigated, relativistic effects and electron-correlation effects were found not to be not additive. For instance the inclusion of relativistic effects in Hartree-Fock calculations reduces the bond length of hydrogen halides whereas inclusion of electron correlation increases the bond length of hydrogen fluoride and leads to significantly smaller corrections for hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide. For the polyatomic molecules studied, no consistent trend is observed, which underlines the importance of explicit calculations that can be performed with the approaches provided in this work.\n540 Chemistry and allied sciences", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["#content", "https://ub.uni-mainz.de", "#", "/mydspace", "/profile", "#", "/advanced-search", "/community-list", "/browse?type=author", "/browse?type=title", "/browse?type=dateissued", "/browse?type=dateavailable", "/browse?type=subject", "/browse?type=type", "/browse?type=department", "#", "https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/4318?locale=en", "https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/4318?locale=de", "#", "/help-faq", "/help-research", "/help-faq-search", "/help-publish", "https://www.ub.uni-mainz.de/de/dissertationen", "/contact", "/", "/handle/20.500.12030/1", "/handle/20.500.12030/2", "/browse?type=author&value=Berger%2C+Christine", "https://ror.org/023b0x485", "http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-4316", "https://nbn-resolving.org/urn/resolver.pl?urn=nbn:de:hebis:77-19331", "https://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/", "/handle/20.500.12030/2", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/4318/1/1933.pdf", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/4318/1/1933.pdf", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/4318/1/1933.pdf", "/handle/20.500.12030/4318?mode=full", "/handle/20.500.12030/4318/statistics", "/imprint", "/privacy", "/contact", "/guidelines", "https://doi.org/10.18452/24678", "https://www.uni-mainz.de/"]}
