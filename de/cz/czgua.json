In lakes Gro\u00dfer Glietzen and Peetsch no effect on stimulation of regrowth of macrophytes could be observed, the exclosures remained free of macrophyte vegetation like the reference plots. This is likely caused by water level fluctuations resulting in lake bottom conditions unsuitable for macrophyte development. Only in Lake Stechlin significant differences of macrophyte development between inside and outside the exclosure have been observed in 2014 and 2015. The ratio of covered vs. uncovered sediment was significantly influenced by presence or absence of benthivorous fishes. Also the ratio of charophytes vs. angiosperms and other groups was significantly influenced. In 2014 and 2015 Charophytes dominated the macrophyte vegetation inside the exclosure, while at the reference plot in 2014 angiosperms dominated and in 2015 significantly increased. The experiment results support the hypothesis, that benthivorous fishes are key species and strongly influencing macrophyte communities. Additionally species-specific direct impacts of certain benthivorous fishes on macrophytes are documented from direct observations.\nE&G Quaternary Science Journal\nFor the first time, evidence of a submerged pine forest from the early Holocene can be documented in a central European lake. Subaquatic tree stumps were discovered in Lake Giesenschlagsee at a depth of between 2 and 5 m using scuba divers, side\u2010scan sonar and a remotely operated vehicle. Several erect stumps, anchored to the ground by roots, represent an in situ record of this former forest. Botanical determination revealed the stumps to be Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) with an individual tree age of about 80 years. The trees could not be dated by means of dendrochronology, as they are older than the regional reference chronology for pine. Radiocarbon ages from the wood range from 10 880\u00b1210 to 10 370\u00b1130 cal. a BP, which is equivalent to the mid\u2010Preboreal to early Boreal biozones. The trees are rooted in sedge peat, which can be dated to this period as well, using pollen stratigraphical analysis. Tilting of the peat bed by 4 m indicates subsidence of the ground due to local dead i...\n2010, Regional Environmental Change\ncharacterizes the Dynamics of aquatic macrophyte Vegetation of 2 lakes in M\u00fcritz National Park (NE Germany) over a period of 35 years using various available datasets and new results\nThe H\u00f6hbeck, an insular elevation in the middle of the vast Elbe River floodplain, was a strategically important place in the Early and High Middle Ages. This is reflected in an unusually high density of strongholds. TheMeetschowsitewas ofmajor importance for several centuries, evenwhen political power changed. Saxons, Franks, Slavs and Germans all kept their main fortification at this place e obviously because of its topographical position, controlling the intersection of a water route and a land route. The significance of Meetschowended with the end of the 10th c. andwas declining until the final abandonment. Lenzen on the other bank of the river took over the functions of Meetschow and developed into the administrative and political centre of the region. Geoarchaeological research revealed evidence for a short phase of heavy natural flooding events sometime between 950 and ca. 980 A.D. Its impact on the topographical situation around the H\u00f6hbeck is discussed in the light of the political situation. The paper focuses on the coincidences in the history of strongholds and flood activity in the 8the10th c. at the H\u00f6hbeck. It is stressed that the documented large scale natural events should be possible to detect in a wider area of northern Europe.\n2009, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences Discussions\nIn order to better understand the processes of the \"Critical Zone\" investigations are mainly carried out in watersheds as they represent parts of the landscape having more or less defined outlines. However, natural watersheds must, in some cases, be characterized as \"black boxes\" with respect to e.g. structures in the underground or catchment boundaries which are generally unknown and need great efforts to be explored. Artificially created watersheds might, thus, be an appropriate alternative as boundaries and inner structures can be planned and defined in advance. This paper presents a recently launched project dealing with the initial phase of ecosystem development with a man-made catchment as central research site. The research site has an area of 6 ha and can be regarded as one of the largest artificial watersheds developed for scientific purposes worldwide. It was completed in 2005 and left for an unrestricted ecosystem succession. This paper introduces the creation and main properties of this site as well as first results of an ongoing monitoring program.\n2005, Forest Ecology and \u2026\nThe model-based analysis of the effects of management options at stand and regional levels on forest functions such as carbon storage and groundwater recharge provides a basis for optimisation of forest planning under global change.

Although trends such as climate change, socioeconomic transformation and institutional change are global in their scope, they have very specific regional outcomes. Regionally distinct coping strategies are required which take into account both the diversity of regional impacts of global change and the local contexts of appropriate responses. This paper explores the impacts of global change on the management of water infrastructure systems in the Berlin-Brandenburg region in terms of three concurrent and overlapping challenges: climate change, socioeconomic change and institutional change. It subsequently examines how regional actors in the water sector are addressing these three dimensions of global change.\n2006, Ecological Modelling\n2019, Geoarchaeology\nKnowledge of historic changes in vegetation, relief, and soil is key in understanding how the uplands in central Europe have changed during the last millennium, being an essential requirement for measures on forest conversion and nature conservation in that area. Evidence of forest\u2010clearing horizons from the medieval period could be systematically documented at four low\u2010 to mid\u2010altitudinal sites (360\u2013640 meters above mean sea level) in the Harz (Harz Mountains), Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains), and \u010ceskomoravsk\u00e1 vrchovina (Bohemian\u2010Moravian Highlands). Subfossil trees with traces of human cutmarks and burning were recovered from buried wet\u2010organic soils (paleosols) within a context of mining and settlement archaeology, applying a multiproxy\u2010approach by using data from archaeology, paleobotany, geochronology, dendrochronology, and pedology. Tree stumps and trunks, as well as small\u2010scale wood remains represent an in situ record of local conifer stands (spruce, fir, and pine). Some deciduous tree taxa also occur. Dating of the tree remains yielded ages from the 10th/11th to the 13th/14th centuries A.D. After deforestation, the tree remains were buried by technogenic and alluvial\u2013colluvial deposits. The reconstructed conifer\u2010dominated woodlands on wet soils mirror the local vegetation structure immediately before the medieval deforestation. As such wet sites are common in the uplands, conifers were significantly present in the natural vegetation even at mid and lower altitudes.\n2011, Die Erde Journal of the Geographical Society of Berlin\n2011, Die Erde Journal of the Geographical Society of Berlin\n2009\nAbstract There is currently an increasing demand for wood as a renewable energy source. Plantations with fast growing trees, such as poplars and willows, have been established, grown in a short rotation coppice (SRC) system. A further increase of SRC plantations is expected in the future, but their effects on biodiversity are little known. We give an overview of the current state of knowledge on the phytodiversity in SRC plantations. Many factors influence the vegetation in a SRC plantation.\nBased on literature and own calculations, the assessment was substantiated that, in the annual sum and at comparable water levels, stands of black alder (Alnus glutinosa [L.] GAERTN.) within rewetted fen lowlands will consume hardly more water than intensified grasslands. This elucidates from the low leaf area index (LAI \u2264 5) of this deciduous tree species. Thus, an annual surplus of 180 to 200 mm of water is required. Water levels between 15 cm above (in winter/spring) and about 50 cm below ground (in summer/fall) are optimal. Scenario calculations were performed under assumed climatic conditions for the fen areas of a representative 855 ha clipping from the middle Trebel river lowland. Alder afforestation appears feasible in sections midway along the river valley, located between the frequently inundated sites beneath the river and the dryer and more sloping sites closer to the edges of the valley. Of some importance for the wetness conditions obtainable is the remaining effect of...\n2009\nThe following six articles included in this series are describing potential effects and implications of the cultivation of Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) on the environment. The articles deal with the effects of SRC on water issues (Dimitriou et al., 2009), groundwater recharge with a spatial perspective (Busch, 2009), phytodiversity (Baum S. et al., 2009) and animal diversity (Schulz et al., 2009), as well as soil issues (Baum C. et al., 2009). Finally, the paper of K\u00f6hn (2009) deals with socioeconomic implications of SRC cultivation.\n2013, Journal of Environmental Management\nDEUQUA Special Publications\n2006, Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, Parts A/B/C\n2002, Forest Ecology and Management\n2011, Regional Environmental Change\n2012, Regional Environmental Change\n2011, Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science\n2007, Jahrestagung der DVFFA \u2026\n2013\n2015, Ecological Indicators\n2000, Landscape and Urban Planning\n2013, World Technopolis Review\n2019, Earth Surface Processes and Landforms\nHumans have triggered or accelerated erosion processes since prehistoric times through agricultural practices. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) is widely used to quantify phases and rates of the corresponding landscape change, by measuring the last moment of daylight exposure of sediments. However, natural and anthropogenic mixing processes, such as bioturbation and tillage, complicate the use of OSL as grains of different depositional ages become mixed, and grains become exposed to light even long after the depositional event of interest. Instead, OSL determines the stabilization age, indicating when sediments were buried below the active mixing zone. These stabilization ages can cause systematic underestimation when calculating deposition rates. Our focus is on colluvial deposition in a kettle hole in the Uckermark region, northeastern Germany.We took 32 samples from five locations in the colluvium filling the kettle hole to study both spatial and temporal patterns in colluviation.We combined OSL dating with advanced age modelling to determine the stabilization age of colluvial sediments. These ages were combined with an archaeological reconstruction of historical ploughing depths to derive the levels of the soil surface at the moment of stabilization; the deposition depths, which were then used to calculate unbiased deposition rates. We identified two phases of colluvial deposition. The oldest deposits (~5 ka) were located at the fringe of the kettle hole and accumulated relatively slowly, whereas the youngest deposits (<0.3 ka) rapidly filled the central kettle hole with rates of two orders of magnitude higher. We suggest that the latter phase is related to artificial drainage, facilitating accessibility in the central depression for agricultural practices. Our results show the need for numerical dating techniques that take archaeological and soil geomorphological information into account to identify spatiotemporal patterns of landscape change, and to correctly interpret landscape dynamics in anthropogenically influenced hilly landscapes.\n2009, Wald\u00f6kologie, \u2026\n2007, Ecological Modelling\n2011\n2007, CAB Reviews: Perspectives in Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Nutrition and Natural Resources\n2008, Hydrological Sciences Journal-journal Des Sciences Hydrologiques\nCarbon storage in soils is sensitive to changing climatic conditions, potentially increasing C fluxes from soils to the atmosphere. This study provides an assessment of recent climate variability (1951\u20132000) and potential future (2001\u20132055) climate change impacts on soil C storage for croplands in the German part of the Elbe River basin. Results indicate that recently (1991\u20132000) croplands are a net source of carbon (net annual flux of 10.8 g C m\u22122 year\u22121 to the atmosphere). The recent temperature trend for the years 1951\u20132000 (+0.8 K in summer and +1.4 K in winter mean temperature) alone have already caused a significant net flux of 1.8 g C m\u22122 year\u22121 to the atmosphere. Future climate change (2001\u20132055) derived from regionalised meteorological properties driven by the IPCC-SRES A1 scenario results in an increased net C flux of an additional 4 g C m\u22122 year\u22121 in comparison to the reference period (1951\u20132000).
