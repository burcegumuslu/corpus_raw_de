Only water, mostly drinking water, will  \nbe renewed in this cycle very quick and continuous. Gigantic quantities of water are present, from which the  \nhydrologic cycle takes the water. The history of hydrologic cycle is very long and interesting. The knowledge of  \nhydrologic cycle in form of today was born in the renaissance. So Leonardo da Vinci is named \u00bbfather of the  \nscience of water\u00ab. Now in beginning of the 20th century E. Br\u00fcckner presented the first water balance of the Earth  \n(1905). The newest water balance is the water balance from R. K. Klige et al. from 1998, published in 2000. She is  \nshown also in a scheme of hydrologic cycle.\nAll water on our planet moves in a global cycle. The\nsun\u2019s energy and gravitation continuously modify the\ngeographic position and physical state of water. The\nhydrological cycle is based on the law of nature and is apermanent and self-contained process of circulation of\nwater on the globe. The total quantity of water is nearly\nconstant. Water entering the cycle (juvenile water fromvolcanic eruptions) corresponds to the quantity of water\nthat is leaving the hydrological cycle by ways of chemical\nbinding (vadose water). The definition of a water balanceis the interaction \u2013 whether  in a specified area or on the\nentire planet \u2013 of factors s uch as precipitation (P), return\n(R), evaporation (E), reserve and consumption. The\ninteraction of all the individual elements of the hydrological\nsystem is the foundation for the science of water-hydrology.\nHow much water is there in the hydrological cycle?\nThe science of water has been conducting research on thisimportant question for over 100 years. No correct answer\nhas so far been found.\nThe water cycle \u2013\na long, but interesting story\n\u00bbThe current of water from the mountains down to the\nvalleys, from land to sea \u2013 we witness its endless flow, yet\nsea levels don\u2019t rise and wells and streams never run dry\u00ab\n\u00bbDen Lauf der Wasser von den Bergen zu den Th\u00e4lern, von dem\nLande zum Meere sehen wir unaufh\u00f6rlich vor unseren Augen sich\nvollziehen, und dennoch wird das Meer nicht voller und die Quel-\nlen und Str\u00f6me versiegen nicht\u00ab  (PFAFF 1878, S. 33).\nThe reason behind this natural phenomenon, the result of\npermanent integration and interaction of our planet\u2019s\natmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere is the hydro-\nlogical cycle. From the vastness of our oceans (361.1million km\u00b2) it acts upon the much smaller continents\n(148.9 million km\u00b2). By extending the cycle from the sea\nover to the land the continents are being integrated. Thecycle is then closed through the return flow from rivers to\nthe oceans and water vapour moving from land to sea.\nToday it is common knowledge that the hydrological\ncycle is driven by the sun\u2019s energy. For a very long time,however, people had no understanding of the origins of the\nglobal flow of water and the hydrological cycle.Thales of Milet (600 B.C.), the ancient Greek philo-\nsopher, realised, that water is the most important factor forthe existence of life on the planet. He believed in a\nsubterranean river system connecting to the Okeanos, the\nocean \u2013 as did other ancient Greek scholars. Water was tobe renewed while passing through it before reaching the\nseas. He considered the world to be a disk swimming on\ntop of the ocean. The continuous renewal of water was amovement of sea water through it. He believed that sea\nwater, while moving through the disk-like Earth, turned to\nfreshwater.\nLimestone with its maze of underground riverbeds,\nalways resurfacing and disappearing deep down below,allowed for these views to emerge. No wonder that suchideas dominated ancient Greek thought.\nOther Greek scholars believed, that water was partially\nrenewed by precipitation while running down towards thesea. But they also shared the view that rivers were partiallyfed by underground water reservoirs that received their\nwater from the sea. They believed in the existence of long\nunderground river systems connected to surface rivers.\nEven Aristotle, the most famous ancient Greek scientist\n(384\u2013322 B.C.) rejected the idea that precipitation and theseeping in of water into the ground could create a renewalprocess or produce groundwater. He was surrounded by\nunderground caves and therefore thought that water was\nformed in hollows, where it cooled down and separatedfrom the air (condensation).\nFinally, Seneca (4 B.C.\u201365 A.C.) contested the\nvaluable idea brought forward by his contemporary Vitruvwhereby all spring water should be considered as rainwater\nthat has seeped into the ground.\nIn medieval times a number of original ideas appeared.\nThey were added to the ancient views still circulating.Permitted were only those findings that corresponded to\nthe Bible which was considered sacrosanct.\nIt was believed that the waters of Paradise were the\nsource of all rivers. People liked to think of undergroundstreams linked to the Garden of Eden. But graduallyscholars returned to the idea of their ancient masters \u2013 it is\nthe ocean that feeds all rivers and streams.\nThere is a passage in the Bible, where in EcclesiastesMarcinek, J.  (2007): Hydrological cycle and water balance - A global survey . In: Loz\u00e1n, J. L., H. Grassl, P. Hupfer, \nL.Menzel & C.-D. Sch\u00f6nwiese.  Global Change: Enough water for all? Wissenschaftliche  Auswertungen,  Hamburg. \nOnline: www.klima-warnsignale.uni-hamburg.de34I, 7 it says: \u00bbAll streams run into the sea, yet the sea never\noverflows. Back to the place from which the streams ran\nthey return to run again\u00ab. Progress in hydrology had to wait.\n\u00bbAlle Fl\u00fcsse gehen zum Meere, und doch wird das Meer nicht\nvoll; an den Ort, wohin die Fl\u00fcsse gehen, dahin gehen sie immerwieder\u00ab, hemmte die Entwicklung der Gew\u00e4sserkunde  (Die Stel-\nle in Prediger Salomo. Die Heilige Schrift \u2013 Z\u00fcrcher Bibel \u2013\nLizenzausgabe 1951. 2. Aufl. Der Prediger \u2013 Das best\u00e4ndige Ei-nerlei im Kreislauf aller Dinge, I,7).\n The idea of a sea that is unknown, a sea that is the source\nof all seas allowed for an abundance of speculation. There\nwere discussions on subterranean channel connections,\nevaporation of sea water, its subsequent precipitation,infiltration and collection in huge underground hollows.\nThe well-respected German medieval scholar Albertus\nMagnus (Graf von Bollst\u00e4dt, 1193\u20131280 A.C.), not unlikeAristotle before him, was unable to remain clear of the\npopular beliefs of his time.\nIt was only during the Rennaissance period (around\n1500), when Leonardo da Vinci discovered the different\nfeatures of the hydrological cycle. But there was no\nresponse to his findings. Finally views changed, when dela M\u00e9therie put forward his principle on the hydrological\ncycle which is still valid today (de la M\u00e9therie-Eschen-\nbach: Theory of the Earth, ll. Leipzig, 1797).\nAnd during the 19\nth century the view that the renewal\nof continental water was due to the hydrological cycle\nbecame more and more popular. It now had its place in thegeographic literature (see Daniel, H.A., Handbuch der Geo-\ngraphie, Leipzig 1866, where he explains the hydrological\ncycle in contemporary fashion).\nThus, with the discovery of the\nhydrological cycle, the originof water on land was known\nMURRAY  (1887) was the first to publish a study which lead\nthe way for subsequent research. He clearly explained the\nhydrological cycle and water balance for the land surfacesas well as for the entire planet. E. B\nR\u00dcCKNER  (1887, 1900)\nconfirmed Murray\u2019s findings by contributing extensive\nscientific proof. In his research, B R\u00dcCKNER  found a formula\nthat represented the Earth\u2019s water balance by creating water\nequations for land and sea each. Eventually he managed to\ndetermine the quantities of water (precipitation and evapo-ration for land and sea, as well as return from the land) to\ncreate a water balance for the entire planet.\nHydrological cycle and\nwater balance research\nBy the end of the 19th century the understanding of the\nEarth\u2019s hydrological cycle had progressed enough to not\nonly generally recognise its cyclic nature, but to also pro-foundly discuss and find answers to what a water balance\nis and what the quantities affected by it are.Even W\nOEIKOF  (1887) believed, that there had to be a\nbalance in the quantity of waters within the hydrological\ncycle. He estimated, that one quarter of the precipitation\nreturned by land to the sea and three-quarters evaporated.Eventually he limited his statement by adding, \u00bb...or was\npartially lost for the circulation of waters\u00ab\nAnschlie\u00dfend engte W OEIKOF  aber diese Aussage mit den Worten\nein \u00bb...oder auch teilweise f\u00fcr die Wasserzirkulation verloren ge-\nhen\u00ab (1887, 1. Teil, S. 50).\nMURRAY , in contrary, was far more consistent, when he\npublished an article discussing total annual precipitation\non the planet\u2019s land surfaces and how it related to annualreturn by rivers. He examined a number of potential factors\nthat could have an impact on the global water balance, gave\nthem their due place in the system and excluded those heconsidered insignificant. As a consequence his work\nresulted in the first textual formulation of the hydrological\ncycle and the water balance for land areas as well as thewhole planet.\nBy using a precipitation chart put together by E. L\nOOMIS\n(1882 or 1883), M URRAY  calculated the average annual\nprecipitation on land and \u2013 using two methods \u2013 the average\nannual return from the land to the sea.\nIn the same year (1887) B R\u00dcCKNER  commented on\nMURRAY \u2019s work in the German Meteorological Journal\n(p.63/64) and added two amendments. Based on M URRAY \u2019s\nwork (1) he calculated the return from land in belts of 10\u00b0latitude. And according to the way how M\nURRAY  had\ndescribed the global water system, he was now in the\nposition (2) to determine the difference between evapo-ration from the land and precipitation and return in belts of\n10\u00b0 latitude.\nIn 1900 B\nR\u00dcCKNER  estimated the relationship between\ngroundwater and river water as follows (p. 91): \u00bbIt is\ndifficult to estimate the importance of submarine springs.\nThe role they play, however, is minor as surfacing of uppergroundwater along coastlines has to happen on the same\nlevel as the return of river water to the oceans \u2013 on sea\nlevel. Groundwater and river water mix in the last moment\u00ab\n\u00bbDie Bedeutung unterseeischer Quellen entzieht sich allerdings\nder direkten Sch\u00e4tzung; doch d\u00fcrfte sie schon deswegen geringsein, weil das Austreten des oberen Grundwassers an den K\u00fcstenin  gleichem Niveau stattfinden muss, wie die Einm\u00fcndung desFlusswassers \u2013 im Meeresniveau; das Grundwasser vereinigt sichhier noch im letzten Augenblick mit dem Flusswasser\u00ab.\nMURRAY \u2019s and B R\u00dcCKNER \u2019s view on groundwater was\nnearly unanimous. Because of its interaction with surface\nwater, groundwater was generally seen as part of the total\nrunoff from the rivers.\nMuch more important for a proper balance between\noceans and land areas was another statement in B R\u00dcCKNER \u2019s\narticle (1900, p.93): \u00bbThe quantity of water contained inthe oceans must be considered constant for longer periods\nof time. Otherwise the water level would fluctuate to such35WATER IN VIEW OF NATURAL  SCIENCES    1\nan extent, that it could be easily observed. Thus the quantity\nof water returned to the ocean must be equal to the loss by\nevaporation\u00ab\n\u00bbDie Wassermasse des Ozeans muss innerhalb l\u00e4ngerer Zeitr\u00e4ume\nals konstant angenommen werden; andernfalls w\u00fcrden allgemeineVer\u00e4nderungen des Wasserstandes erfolgen, die sich der Wahrneh-mung nicht h\u00e4tten entziehen k\u00f6nnen. Es muss also ebensoviel Was-ser dem Ozean zur\u00fcckgegeben werden, als ihm durch Verdunstungentzogen wird\u00ab\n2.\nThe last part of the quotation is identical with M URRAY . In\nthe first part of his quotation Br\u00fcckner raises a point that\nuntil today remains important for the calculation of waterbalances between oceans and land surfaces. The related\nfootnote is as follows: \u00bbIf there was a reduction to oceanic\nwaters equal to 2% of average annual rainfall onto theEarth\u2019s land areas, or 20 mm of rain, the overall water\nlevel would sink just over 1cm, in 10 years around 10 cm.\nEven a decrease of a fracture (1/4\u20131/5) of that amountcould hardly have escaped our observation\u00ab\n(W\u00fcrden jedes Jahr nur 2% des mittleren j\u00e4hrlichen\nRegenfalls der Landfl\u00e4chen der Erde, also 20 mm Re-\ngen, dem Ozean dauernd entzogen werden, so m\u00fcssteder Wasserstand \u00fcberall j\u00e4hrlich um etwas \u00fcber 1 cm,\nin 10 Jahren also um etwa 10 cm sinken. Selbst ein\nSinken um einen Bruchteil (1/4\u20131/5) dieses Betragesh\u00e4tte der Beobachtung schwerlich entgehen k\u00f6nnen)\n(B\nR\u00dcCKNER , 1900, S. 93. Fu\u00dfnote 2).\nIn 1905 B R\u00dcCKNER  managed for the first time to express the\nglobal water system by creating a basic formula for theland surfaces and the oceans each while still showing the\ninteraction between the two. Today German literature is\nusing different symbols shown in  parentheses in thequotations.\nIn order to show a balance of the hydrological cycle,\nthe following items need to be taken into consideration:\nAnnual evaporation from the sea (=EM)\nAnnual rainfall over the sea (=PM)\nAnnual amount of water vapour moving from sea to land (=VM)Annual evaporation from the land (=EL)\nAnnual rainfall over the land (=(PL)\nAnnual amount of water vapour moving from land to sea (=VL)Annual return of rivers to the ocean F (=RL)\n(All these items are expressed in cubic kilometres of liquid water).\nIf we can assume that the hydrological cycle is in a statio-\nnary state, then those seven items are related in such away that the knowledge of three of them allows for the\ncalculation of two others. The two remaining can be enti-\nrely ignored. Rainfall on the sea equals evaporation onthe sea, reduced by the amount of vapour moving from\nthe sea to the land and augmented by the amount of vapour\nmoving from the land to the sea. Rainfall on the landequals the amount of evaporation moving from the sea to\nthe land, augmented  by the amount of evaporation on theland and reduced by the amount of vapour moving from\nthe sea to the land. The rivers return water to the sea thathas moved as vapour from the sea onto the land. That\nreturn does, however, not constitute the entire quantity of\nwater returning to the ocean. There is water in the form ofvapour in the atmosphere, that is moving from the land to\nthe sea (Dl). The entire amount of vapour moving from\nthe land to the sea (Dm) is greater than the amount ofwater (F) returning with the rivers by the above amount\n(Dl). Therefore Dm = F + Dl. To put it differently: the\nannual return of rivers to the oceans equals the differencebetween the quantity of water vapour moving from the\nsea onto the land, and from the land into the sea.\nThe balance of the hydrological cycle can therefore be\nexpressed as follows:\nRm = Vm \u2013 Dm + De = Vm \u2013 (Dm \u2013 Dl) = Vm \u2013 F          (1)Rl = Vl + Dm \u2013 Dl = Vl + (Dm \u2013 Dl) = Vl + F                 (2)\nExpressed in symbols used today in German literature,\nthe basic formula for the sea according to B\nR\u00dcCKNER\n(1905) is as follows:\nNM = VM \u2013 AL\n                                   and for the land:NL = VL + AL\nAs the last variable in calculating the planet\u2019s water\nbalance, B\nR\u00dcCKNER  eventually added the average annual\nevaporation from the ocean\u2019s surfaces. In line with theabove equation for the sea the precipitation onto the sea\nsurfaces can be determined by subtracting the return from\nland areas.\nBy determining the evaporation from the sea and using\nlong term annual averages, Br\u00fcckner, for the first time, was\nable to calculate the quantities of water circulating in thehydrological cycle. (see Table 1.3-1 ):\nEvaporation from the sea 384,000 km\u00b3\nRainfall on the sea 59,000 km\u00b3\nRiver water to the oceans 25,000 km\u00b3Evaporation from the land 97,000 km\u00b3\nRainfall on the land 122,000 km\u00b3\n\u00bbOur endeavour to calculate a balance about the hydrologic\ncycle as illustrated above, might, to some people, appearrather daring. In fact will I have to repeat that I do not\nclaim to be extremely precise as related documents are still\ntoo uncertain. More precise information will have to befound in the future...

Knowledge about\nthe quantity of water present on our planet is based on eitherapproximation or estimation. By taking into consideration\ndifferent approaches, we will present values (see Table 1.3-\n1) that have been mentioned by K\nLIGE et al. (1998, p. 339).\nBalance for the Earth\u2019s water system\nThere are two requirements for the average annual water\nsystem of our planet and that of the oceans and the landsurfaces to be in balance:\u007f the climate of the Earth must remain the same for many\nyears \u2013 although for a shorter period than a geological\nperiod \u2013 and\n\u007f the average sea level must remain constant over a longer\nperiod of time. The second requirement already follows\nthe first one.\nB\nR\u00dcCKNER  had already referred with emphasis to the se-\ncond requirement (1900, p.93).\nFollowing the equations for the sea and land water\nbalances by B R\u00dcCKNER  (1905, p.437) and taking into\naccount the above requirements, the average annual\nevaporation on the Earth\u2019s surface must equal the averageannual rainfall on its surface. The basic formula for the\nwater system is therefore37WATER IN VIEW OF NATURAL  SCIENCES    1\nVE = NE (5)\nwhereby\nV = evaporation, N = precipitation and index\nE = Earth\u2019s surface\nBR\u00dcCKNER \u2019s equations show that evaporation as well as\nprecipitation on the Earth\u2019s surface are each made up of\ntwo water system values. These are the evaporation from\nsea and land areas (VM and VL) as well as theprecipitation on sea and land areas (NM and NL). It can\ntherefore be said\nVE = VM + VL = NE = NM + NL. (6)\nIt has so far not been possible to satisfyingly determine\nVL from direct measurements of the Earth\u2019s land surfaces.\nTherefore, when conducting water balance research, the\nevaporation from land areas is usually determined asbeing the remaining value in the water system equation\nfor land areas:\nVL = NL \u2013 AL (7)\nThe difference between precipitation and evaporation for\nland and oceanic areas must be balanced, to make sure\nthat there is an overall balance on our planet. Excess waterfrom the main land will be returned through the resulting\nreturn AL to the ocean, so that\nAL = NL \u2013 VL (8)\nOn the other hand evaporation is exceeding precipitation.\nIt therefore reaches into the atmosphere from where it is\nmoved over the continents. There it condenses and falls\ndown as precipitation (see Chapter 1.5). This closes theglobal water cycle.\nWater balances for the Earth\nThe long line of water system balances for the Earth ( Table\n1.3-1 ) is headed by that of B R\u00dcCKNER \u2019s first calculations\n(1905). Another one, published by the writer in 1966,contains a 1964 calculation of return from land areas. It\nresulted in a value of 33,500 km\u00b3 that had to be corrected in\n1965 due to new return data for the Amazon, Orinoco andBrahmaputra to 36,500 km\u00b3. When V . M. K\nOTLJAKOV  (1970,\nin L\u2019vovi\u00e9 1971a) announced a new return value for the\nAntarctic inland ice of 2,200 km\u00b3, the overall value wasagain modified and is now at 37,500 km\u00b3. Although this\nnumber is close to the average value of all calculations inthe table, return data especially in recent calculations vary\ntremendously.\nThe value given for precipitation on land areas is based\non calculations by B\nROOKS  & H UNT (1930) and has been\nrounded up by E. Reichel (1952) to 100,000 km\u00b3. As of\n1934 the value of 99,000 and 100,000 km\u00b3 often appears inthe balances. Most recent calculations, however, put that\nvalue higher.\nThe values given by B\nUDYKO  and others (1956) as well\nas A LBRECHT  (1960) for the evaporation from sea surfaces\nnearly correspond. In 1966 and in this article the writer\nmade use of Albrecht\u2019s value. The difference betweenevaporation from sea surfaces and return from land surfaces\nequals the precipitation on to sea surfaces.\nWe especially want to draw attention to the water\nsystem balance of B\nUDYKO  (1963, also see D YCK 1968).\nWith the Earth\u2019s basic formula ( Tab 1.3-1 , column NE =\nVE) he obtained the same result - although using a diffe-rent method \u2013 as  W. M\nEINARDUS  (1934).\nFor reference purposes the table also contains values\nfor the global hydrological cycle, that have been establishedby means of an advanced global climatic model (ECHA-\nM4_OPYC). The numbers are more or less within the range\nof conventional calculations. Surprisingly, in bothcalculations the hydrological cycle is not closed.Calculations for the last decade of the 21\nst century point to\nan increase in the circulation of global waters due to a\npossible climate change (see Chapter 3.1.3).\nFinal remarks\nToday we have a basic understanding of the global\nhydrologic cycle. Nevertheless we are still lacking\nknowledge not only of some of the details, but also of theprecise definition of its basic values. Even though there are\nmany new ways to do research, the error margin is still\nquite high. Of major importance is the correct proportionalrepresentation defining the hydrological cycle. In that sense\nall approaches included in the table are \u00abcorrect\u00bb. For\ninstance the relationship NM/VM only slightly oscillatesaround the average value of 0.9, whereas the ratio VL/NL\n= 0.64\u00b10.06 moves between 0.52 and 0.90. This means\nthat none of the estimations represented in the table can berecommended. With respect to the amount of data\nintroduced and method applied, preference should be given\nto the most recent calculations.", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
