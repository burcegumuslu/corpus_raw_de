Epidemiological \nstudies have shown that they  often co -occur  with addictive behaviors , which in part might be \nexplained by common risk factors. Rumination might be such a risk factor. Comorbidity can \nhave  substantial adverse effects  for those affected. Thus, combined treatment approaches are \nneeded. These should not be restricted to individuals wi th clinical disorders. In light of an \napparent treatment gap , new treatment approaches that provide widespread access to evidence -\nbased treatments need  to be explored . In recent years, e -health interventions  received a lot of \nattention. With their  potential to be widely disseminated,  they might be  suitable to provide \npopulation- based  intervention approaches. Developing population- based interventions might \npresent special challenges  to intervention developers , for example, in terms of intervention \ndesign  or the selection of sample s to preliminary test interventions.  This thesis  explored the \napplication of e -health interventions in the treatment and prevention of depressive symptoms \nand addictive  behaviors . Its first aim was to provide an overview on publicly accessible \nevidence -based e-health interventions for the treatment and prevention of depressive symptoms \n(study 1) . The second aim was to test the feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness \nof a newly developed computer -based expert system intervention simultaneously targeting  \nhazardous alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms and to investigate the importance of \nthe sample selection when preliminary testing interventions (study 2) . The third aim was to \nfurther investigate rumination with its subfactors brooding and reflection as a common cause \nof depression and addictive behaviors and thus as a potential target for combined interventions \nby analyzing its associations with symptoms of pathological gambling (SPG s; study 3) .  \nMethods:  This thesis  provides a  summar y of different working steps in the process of  \ndeveloping and testing a computer -based intervention for health care patients ( HCPs ) with \ncomorbid hazardous alcohol consumption patterns and depressive symptoms. In study 1 , a \nsystematic literature search was conducted to identify evidence -based  e-health interventions  for \ndepressive symptoms . Interventions were considered for further inspection if  studies provided \nevidence for at least small intervention effects and if  the interventions were accessible to at least \nselected groups of individuals . For study 2, 2773 consecutive HCPs  were screened for \nhazardous drinking and depressive symptoms . Of the 41 HCPs who were offered to participate \nin the study , 27 (65.9%) consented. To investigate the importance of the sample selection when \npreliminary testing interventions, HCPs were compared to media recruited volunteers (MVs). 6 \n \nOver a period of 6 months, study participants received 6 individualized counselling letters and \nweekly short  messages. Pre-post data were analyzed for 30 participants (15 HCPs, 15 MVs) . \nIntervention acceptability was assessed in post -intervention interview s conducted with 32 study \nparticipants. In study 3, cross -sectional data of 506 ( 80.4% male) individuals aged 14 to 64 \nyears with a history of gambling problems were analyzed . Association s between the rumination \nsubfactors and SPG s across different levels of problem gambling severity  were investigated  by \nmeans of s equential quantile regression .      \nResults: In study 1 , 37 publicly accessible evidence- based e- health interventions  for depressive \nsymptoms  were identified . Most  interventions (81.1%) were available in English. For the \nGerman language area, only 3 interventions were identified. In study 2,  HCPs and MVs reduced \nregular binge drinking (HCPs: p = 0.016; MVs: p = 0.031) and depressiveness (HCPs: p = \n0.020; MVs: p < 0.001). MVs further reduced average daily consumption ( p = 0.034) . Both \nsubsamples rated the intervention positive. C ompared to HCPs , MVs rated the alcohol module \nmore favorably ( p = 0.012).  Intervention usage was higher in MVs than in HCPs ( p = 0.013).  \nStudy 3 show ed that at the median, ruminative brooding was positively associated with the \nseverity of problem gambling after controlling for covariates  (p = 0.005) . Along the distribution \nof problem gambling severity, findi ngs did hold for all but the lowest severity level. Ruminative \nreflection  was not associated with problem gambling severity at the median ( p = 0.347) .  \nConclusions: E-health interventions show great potential in the treatment and prevention of \ndepressive symptoms and addictive behaviors. However, more research is needed to clarify how \nto make the most of this potential. Important questions that remain to be answered include, for \nexample, how to best provide e -health interventions to those in need  or how to design \ninterventions in order to maximize their reach and thus their public health impact. This thesis \nshowed that 1)  publicly  accessible evidence- based e-health interventions for de pressive \nsymptoms were available . However, the supply in the German language area was low. 2) The \ncomputer -based expert system intervention targeting hazardous alcohol consumption and \ndepressive symptoms  was technically and logistically feasible , acceptable,  and may have the \npotential to reduce hazardous drinking and depressive symptoms in different populations , \nincluding populations unselected in terms of their motivation to change . To avoid biased \nconclusions about the potential of interventions, intervention developers should preliminary test \ninterventions on intend ed target populations. 3) Rumination  might be important in the \ndevelopment and maintenance of addictive  behaviors . With its relations to depression and  \naddictive behaviors, it should be considered as a target for future combined interventions. 7 \n \nZUSAMMENFASSUNG  \n \nHinte rgrund: Depressive St\u00f6rungen sind hoch pr\u00e4valente und beeintr\u00e4chtigende Erkrankungen. \nEpidemiologische Studien zeigen eine h\u00e4ufige Komorbidit\u00e4t mit Suchtverhaltensweisen. \nGemeinsame Risikofaktoren  k\u00f6nnten dies teilweise erkl\u00e4ren . Rumi nation k\u00f6nnte ein solche r \nRisikofaktor sein. Komorbidit\u00e4t kann umfassende nachteilige Auswirkungen auf die \nBetroffenen haben. Daher werden kombinierte Behandlungsans\u00e4tze ben\u00f6tigt. Diese sollten sich \nnicht nur auf Personen mit klinischen St\u00f6rungen beschr\u00e4nk en. In Anbetracht einer \noffenkundigen Versorgungsl\u00fccke m\u00fcssen neue Therapiev erfahren , die vielen Menschen einen \nZugang zu evidenzbasierten Behandlungen erm\u00f6glichen, exploriert werden. In den letzten \nJahren haben  E-Health Interventionen zunehmend Beachtung gefunden. Da diese weit \nverbreitet werden k\u00f6nnen, sind sie m\u00f6glicherweise geeignet , um populationsbasierte \nInterventionsans\u00e4tze bereitzustellen. Die Entwicklung populationsbasierter Interventionen \nk\u00f6nnte besondere Anforderungen an Interventionsentwickler s tellen , zum Beispiel im Hinblick  \nauf das Interventionsdesign oder die Auswahl von Stichproben f\u00fcr Pilottestungen  von \nInterventionen. Diese Dissertation besch\u00e4ftigte sich mit der Anwendung von E -Health -\nInterventionen in der Behandlung und Pr\u00e4vention von depressiven Symptomen und \nSucht verhaltensweisen. Das erste Ziel  dieser Arbeit w ar es, einen \u00dcberblick zu \u00f6ffentlich \nzug\u00e4nglichen evidenzbasierten E -Health -Interventionen zur Behandlung und Pr\u00e4vention \ndepressiver Symptome zu liefern (Studie 1). Das zweite Ziel war es, die Machbarkeit, \nAkzeptanz und m\u00f6gliche Effektivit\u00e4t einer neu entwickelten computergest\u00fctzten  \nExpertensystem intervention, welche gleichzeitig auf die Reduktion eines riskanten \nAlkoholkonsums und depressiver Symptome abzielt, zu untersuchen. Gleichzeitig sollte die \nBedeutung der Stichprobenauswahl bei Pilottestungen  von Interventionen untersucht werden \n(Studie 2) . Das dritte Ziel war es, weiteres  Wissen dar\u00fcber zu erlangen , inwieweit Rumination \nmit seinen F aktoren Brooding und Reflection einen gemeinsamen Risikofaktor von  \nDepressionen und Suchtverhaltensweisen und somit auch ein potentielles Ziel f\u00fcr kombinierte  \nInterventionen darstellt.  Dazu wurde der Zusammenhang zwischen Rumination und \nSymptomen  des Pathologischen Gl\u00fccksspielens  (SPGs) untersucht (Studie 3). \nMethode:  Diese Dissertation liefert eine Zusammenfassung verschiedener Arbeitsschritte im \nRahmen der Entwicklung und Testung einer Intervention f\u00fcr Patienten der medizinischen \nVersorgung (HCPs) mit komorbidem riskante m Alkoholkonsum und depressiven Symptomen. \nIn St udie 1 wurde eine systematische Literaturrecherche zur Identifikation evidenzbasierter E-8 \n \nHealth -Interventionen bei depressiven Symptomen durchgef\u00fchrt. Interventionen wurden f\u00fcr \neine weitere Betrachtung ausgew\u00e4hlt, wenn in Studien Hinweise auf mindestens kl eine \nInterventionseffekte gefunden wurden und wenn die Interventionen zumindest f\u00fcr spezifische \nGruppen zug\u00e4nglich waren. F\u00fcr Studie 2 wurden 2773 konsekutive HCPs  auf riskanten \nAlkoholkonsum und depressive Symptome gescreent. Von den 41 HCPs , denen die \nStudienteilnahme angeboten wurde, willigten 27 (65.9%) ein. Um die Bedeutung der \nStichprobenauswahl bei Pilottestungen von Interventionen zu untersuchen,  wurden HCPs mit \nmedienrekrutierten Personen  (MVs)  verglichen. \u00dcber einen Zeitraum von 6 Monaten erhielten \nStudienteilnehmer 6 individualisierte Beratungsbriefe und w\u00f6chentliche Kurznachrichten. Pre -\nPost-Daten wurden f\u00fcr 30 Personen (15 HCPs , 15 M Vs) analysiert. Die Interventionsakzeptanz \nwurde in post -interventionellen Befragungen erhoben, welche mit 32 Studienteilnehmern \ndurchgef\u00fchrt wurden. In Studie 3 wurden Querschnittsdaten von 506 (80.4% m\u00e4nnlich) \nPersonen im Alter von 14 bis 64 Jahren mit einer Vorgeschichte von Gl\u00fccksspielproblemen \nanalysiert. Mit tels sequentieller Quantilregression wurde die Assoziation zwischen den \nRuminationsfaktoren und SPG s \u00fcber die unterschiedlichen Auspr\u00e4gungen des problematischen \nGl\u00fccksspielens  hinweg  untersucht.  \nErgebnisse: In Studie 1 wurden 37 \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4ngliche evidenzbasierte Interventionen f\u00fcr \ndepressive Symptome  identifiziert. Die Mehrzahl der Interventionen (81.1%) war in englischer \nSprache verf\u00fcgbar.  In deutscher Sprache wurden lediglich 3 Interventionen identifiziert. In \nStudie 2 zeig te sich f\u00fcr HCPs und MVs eine Reduktion des regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Rauschtrinkens  \n(HCPs : p = 0.016; MVs : p = 0.031) und der Depressivit\u00e4t (HCPs: p =  0.020; MVs: p <  0.001). \nMVs reduzierten dar\u00fcber hinaus auch ihre durchschnittliche t\u00e4gliche Alkoholkonsummenge ( p \n= 0.034). Beide Gruppen beurteilten die Intervention positiv. Verglichen mit HCPs beurteilten \nMVs das Alkoholmodul wohlwollender  (p = 0.012) . Die Interventionsnutzung war bei MVs \nh\u00f6her als bei HCPs ( p = 0.013).  In Studie 3 zeigte sich , dass Brooding  nach Kontrolle von \nKovariablen am Median positiv mit SPGs  assoziiert war  (p = 0.005) . Mit Ausnahme der \nniedrigsten Auspr\u00e4gung von Gl\u00fccksspielsymptomen konnte dieser Zusammenhang entlang der \nVerteilung der Gl\u00fccksspielproblemschwere be st\u00e4tigt werden. Reflection  war am Median nicht \nmit SPGs  assoziiert  (p = 0.347) .  \nSchlussfolgerungen: E-Health -Interventionen k\u00f6nnten in der Behandlung und Pr\u00e4vention von \ndepressiven Symptomen und Suchtverhaltensweisen von gro\u00dfem Nutzen sein. Es sind jedoch \nweitere Untersuchungen notwendig, um abzukl\u00e4ren, wie sich ihr Potenzial am besten \naussch\u00f6pfen l\u00e4sst. Wichtige noch offene Fragen sind zum Beispiel, wie man E -Health -9 \n \nInterventionen den Menschen, die von diesen profitieren k\u00f6nnten, bestm\u00f6glich zur Verf\u00fcgung \nstellen k\u00f6nnte oder wie man Interventionen gestalten muss , um deren Erreichung und somit \nauch deren Public -Health -Impact zu maximieren.  Diese Dissertation zeigte, dass 1) \u00f6ffentlich \nzug\u00e4ngliche evidenzbasierte E -Health -Interventi onen f\u00fcr depressive Symptome verf\u00fcgbar  \nwaren . Jedoch war  das Angebot f\u00fcr den deutschsprachigen Raum gering . 2) Die \ncomputergest\u00fctzte Expertensystemintervention, die sowohl riskanten Alkoholkonsum als auch \ndepressive Symptome adressiert, war technisch und l ogistisch machbar, akzeptabel, und ist \nm\u00f6glicherweise geeignet , riskanten Alkoholkonsum und depressive Symptome in \nunterschiedlichen Populationen zu reduzieren , inklusive solcher , die hinsichtlich ihrer \nVer\u00e4nderungsbereitschaft unselegiert sind.  Zur Vermeidung verzerrter Schlussfolgerungen \nhinsichtlich des Potenzials von Interventionen sollten deren Pilottestungen unter Verwendung \nihrer tats\u00e4chlichen Zielgruppen erfolgen . 3) Rumination  scheint  eine wichtige Rolle in der \nEntwicklung und Aufrechterhaltung von Suchtverhaltensweisen einzunehmen . Aufgrund seiner \nAssoziationen mit Depressionen und Suchtverhaltensweisen sollte  Rumination  als m\u00f6gliches \nZiel f\u00fcr k\u00fcnftige kombinierte Interventionen in Be tracht gezogen werden.  10 \n \n1. INTRODUCTION \n \n1.1 Prevalence of depressive disorders and burden associated with depression  \nDepressive disorders are highly prevalent and disabling diseases . In the first wave of t he \nnationally representative German Health Interview and Examination Survey  for Adults \n(DEGS1 ), a point prevalence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms of 8.1% in the adult \npopulation aged 18 to 79  was found, with women  showing higher prevalences than men (10.2% \nversus 6.1% ) [1]. The additional mental health module of th e DEGS1 further provided 12-\nmonth prevalence data for major depression and dysthymia  in the adult population aged 18 to \n79, which totaled  6.8% and 1.7%, respectively [2]. Again, the prevalences in women were \nhigher than in men (9.5% versus 4.0% for major depression; 2.1% versus 1.2% for dysthymia). \nAccording to the G lobal Burden of Disease Study 2015, depressive disorder s (major depression \nand dysthymia) were the third leading cause for years lived with disability in Germany  in 2015 \n[3]. In accordance with the higher prevalence of major depression observed in women, previous \ndata further showed that in Germany, major depression accounts for considerably more years \nlived with disability  in women than in men [4] .  \nIn addition to those suffering from clinical depression , many experience subclinical depressive \nsymptoms  [5,6] . This symptom severity level should also be taken seriously  as it was found to \nbe associated with impaired functioning  [5,6]  and constitutes a risk factor for  developing a \nclinical depression  [6].  \n \n1.2 Comorbidity with addictive behaviors   \nComorbidity in this thesis means that in addition to an index condition other diseases or disease \nsymptoms coexist in an individual [7] . In this broad definition, the different  conditions do not \nnecessarily have to be present at the same time.  \nIndividuals suffering from depression often experience other mental health problems as well  \n[8]. Epidemiological stud ies have repeatedly shown high comorbidities between depressive \ndisorders and substance use disorders  (SUDs)  [9-15]. These do not occur by chance  [16]. For \nexample, for the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, the odds \nfor any 12 -month alcohol  or drug  use disorder in individuals with a 12- month major depression \nwere reported to be twofold [11]. The odds for a 12-month major depression in individuals with 11 \n \nany 12-month alcohol or drug use disorder  were reported to be two - to fourfold [10] . Depression \ncomorbidity has further been observed in behavioral addictions  such as pathological gambling \n[17-19] and Internet addiction [20- 22]. \n \n1.3 Possible mechanisms underlying the  comorbidity  \nIdentifying the mechanisms underlying the prevalent comorbidity of depression and addictive \nbehaviors is important as it can lead to the development of new treatment and prevention \nstrategies [23,24] . The available evidence shows that the relationship between depression and \naddictive behaviors is complex and that there are multiple  possible explanations for the \nobserved comorbidity patterns [16,24] . Reviewing the epidemiology of the comorbidity of \nmental disorders and SUDs , Kessler [16] concluded that , besides methodological factors, thre e \nexplanations exist  for the prevalent comorbidity  of mental disorders and SUDs . 1) Mental \ndisorders lead to the onset and/or persistence of SUDs  (e.g., through self -medication of \ndysphoric  mood) . 2) SUDs  lead to the onset and/or persistence of mental disorders, most likely \nthrough biological (brain alter ing effects)  and environmental (increased exposure to stress  and \ndecreased access to coping resources ) mechanisms . 3) Common causes (genetic or \nenvironmental) lead to the onset and/or persistence of both types of disorders [16] . As, for \nexample,  implied by studies analyzing associations between gambling behavior and mental \ndisorders [17,25,26] , these explanations  are likely transferable to the comorbidity of  depression \nand behavioral addictions . Rumination, that is, to think about possible causes and implications \nof one\u2019s mood [27] , may constitute a common cause underlying the comorbidity of depression \nand addictive behaviors. According to Treynor and colleagues [28] , rumination consists of two \ndistinct factors . They  name d these factors  brooding and reflection. Whereas b rooding was \ndescribed as \u201ca passive comparison of one\u2019s current situation with some unachieved standard\u201d \n([28], p. 256) , reflection was described as \u201ca purposeful turning inward to engage i n cognitive \nproblem solving to alleviate one\u2019s depressive symptoms \u201d ([28], p. 256) . Rumination has \nrepeatedly been shown to be an important contributor to depression [29] . Besides that, it has \nbeen shown to be associated with substance use behavior and substance use -related problems \n[30-33]. Furthermore, e vidence suggest s that rumination , especially its subfactor brooding,  \nmight be associated with gambling behavior as well [34] .  \n 12 \n \n1.4 Consequences of comorbidity  \nResearch on the conseq uences of the comorbidity between depression and addictive behaviors \nmainly addressed comorbid depression and SUDs . I will hereinafter focus  on this comorbidity  \nand thereby especially on comorbid depression and alcohol use disorders (AUDs).  \nNumerous  studies conducted with clinical and population samples have shown that c omorbidity \nbetween depressive symptoms  and SUDs  can have substantial  adverse effects including  higher \ndisorder severity  [35,36] , worse social functioning [37], increased disability [38], increased risk \nfor suicide [35,39- 41], and a high vulnerability to additional psychopathology  [35,41] . For \ncomorbid depressive symptoms and AUDs, it has been shown that AUDs have adverse effects \non treatment outcomes and course of depressive disorders [37,42,43] . Vice versa, depressive \nsymptoms in AUDs were associated with worse AUD treatment outcomes [44,45] , relapse \n[46,47] , and the persistence of AUDs [48] . Comorbidity with depressive symptoms should \nfurther b e paid attention to in individuals with subclinical AUDs . Hazardous consumption, that \nis, drinking above recommended levels, has been shown to be highly prevalent in general \npopulation and primary care samples [49-51] and to be a risk factor for  adverse health events \n[51-53]. Given the  prevalence  of hazardous drinking and given the associated health risks , \ntaking measures to  successfully address hazardous  consumption patterns may considerably \nimprove  public health. However, reducing alcohol intake in depressed individuals might be \ndifficult.  Mental health problems have been shown to fuel alcohol consumption in individuals \nwith subclinical consumption patterns [54,55]  and to be  associated with cognitive a nd \nmotivational patterns that could hinder individuals from successfully changing substance use \nbehavior [56- 58]. Thus, concurrent depressive symptoms might hamper reduction efforts .  \n \n1.5 Need for  combined treatments  \nThe prevalent comorbidity  of SUDs and depressive disorders and the associated negative \nconsequences show the need for combined treatment approaches [23] . The evidence provided \nabove furt her implies that treatments should not be restricted to individuals with clinical \ndisorders. In light of an apparent treatment gap in terms of mental health problems [59,60] , new \ntreatment approaches that have the potential to close this gap need to be explored. E -health \ninterventions  offer the opportunity to provide widespread access to evidence -based treatments \nin a cost -effective and time saving manner [61] . In doing so, they may help to overcome barriers \nto mental health treatment [62,63]  and thus  may help to close the treatment gap . Single focused 13 \n \ne-health interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms [64]  \nand alcohol consumption [65]. Evidence further suggests that e -health interventions can \nsuccessfully be used in the treatment of comorbid clinical and subclinical AUDs  and depressive \nsymptoms  [61,63,66,67] . The promising results concerning the  effectiveness of e-health \ninterventions are encouraging. As they  have the potential to be widely disseminated [68] , they \nmight be suitable to provide population- based intervention approaches even for complex health \nissues (e.g., comorbid depressive symptoms and addictive behaviors ) and thus could contribute \nto substantially improving public  health . Developing  population- based interventions , however,  \nmight present special  challenges to intervention developers , for example, when preliminary \ntesting interventions . The ORBIT  model for developing behavioral treatments [69]  proposed \nthat it is suf ficient to rely on convenience samples instead of representative ones when \nconducting preliminary tests of interventions. Yet , this  might not be sufficient for interventions \nthat aim for an impact on a population level, as convenience samples likely do not adequately \nrepresent the general population (e.g., in terms of motivation to change) .  \n \n1.6 Aims  \nThis thesis is based on three papers that explored  the application of e-health  interventions in the \ntreatment and prevention of depressive symptoms and addictive behaviors , as well as probable \ncommon causes  underlying their prevalent co morbidity  that might be targeted in future  \ncombined interventions .  \nThe first aim was  to provide  a basic overview on publicly accessible evidence- based e-health \ninterventions for the treatment and prevention of depressive symptoms  by means of a literature \nsearch and to summarize the ir basic characteristics . Interventions  available in German ought to \nbe described in more detail. This was  published in : \nKrause K, G\u00fcrtler D, Bischof G, Rumpf HJ, Lucht M, John U, Meyer C.

Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Psychiatrie, Psychologie \nund Psychotherapie  2016 ; 64(2) :121-131. (Impact factor Social Science Citation Index [SSCI] \n2017: 0.661)  \n \nThe second aim was to develop a computer -based expert  system intervention simultaneously \ntargeting hazardous alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms and to test its feasibility \nand acceptability in health care patients (HCPs) . As an indicator of potential intervention 14 \n \neffectiveness, changes in alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms over a period of 6 \nmonths ought to be analyzed. To investigate  the importance of the sample selection in the early \nstages of developing and test ing behavioral interventions , the proactively recruited HCPs ought \nto be  compared to media recruited volunteers (MVs).

European Addiction Research 2019;  25(3):119-131. (Impact factor Social Science \nCitation Index [SSCI] 2017: 2.653)  \n \nThe third aim was to further investigate rumination as an underlying common cause of \ndepression and addictive behaviors . Therefore, it ought to be analyzed how the rumination \nsubfactors brooding and reflection are associated with symptoms of pathological gambling \n(SPGs) in  individuals representing different levels of gambling problems .

(Impact factor Social Science Citation \nIndex [SSCI] 2017: 3.628)  \n \n 15 \n \n2. METHODS  \n \nThe results  presented in this thesis  originate d from work that  was conducted within the research \nconsortium  AERIAL (Addiction: Early Recognition and Intervention Across the Lifespan) , \nfunded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The following section \nsummarizes the materials and methods used. More detailed descriptions are provided in the \nrelated scientific papers. AERIAL aimed at investigating new diagnosis and trea tment options \nfor addictive disorders. The related project realized at the University Medicine Greifswald \n(grant number : FKZ  01EE1406F ) aimed at developing and testing a computer -based \nintervention for patients with hazardous alcohol consumption patterns and concurrent \ndepressive symptoms . The intervention was  intended to be an expert system that provides \nindividually tailored written feedback. A  depression module for such an  intervention had to be \nnewly developed. M y initial task in the AERIAL project was  to identify  key features of already \navailable and scientifically evaluated e -health interventions  for depressive symptoms . \nTherefore,  I conducted the literature search described in study 1  [70] . Based on the findings of \nthe literature revie w and the available expertise at the Institute of Social Medicine and \nPrevention, I drafted the intervention concept . This included the definition of the structure of \nthe feedback information. In addition to that, m y tasks within the process  of developing the \nintervention included writing feedback text modules, defining the decision rules for tailoring \nthe intervention, and designing visual feedback elements. A computer scientist ensured the \ntechnical realization of the intervention. In prepa ration of a randomized controlled trial , the \nnewly developed intervention was then pilot tested (study 2 [71] ). Within the pilot study , I was \nresponsible for  preparing the study assessments , developing the databases, recruiting general \nmedical practices and hospital wards as screening locations, organiz ing and supervis ing the \nscreenings  of HCPs, organizing the media recruitment, and monitoring the functionality of the \nintervention. A computer scientist provided technical assistance when necessary. Furthermore, \nI conducted post -intervention intervi ews with study participants to assess intervention \nacceptability. Besides being involved in the development  and pilot testing  of the AERIAL \nintervention, I started to explore possible future targets for combined e-health interventions \naddressing depressive symptoms and addictive behaviors (study 3 [72] ) using  data from an \nepidemiological study on pathological gambling in Germany  [73] .  \n 16 \n \n2.1 Methods of s tudy 1  (Krause  et al., 2016)  \nLiterature search and publication selection \nOn September 30, 2014, a literature search was conducted within the databases Web of Science \nand PubMed. The search terms used are provided in Table 1. To be considered for the review, \npublications had to be written in German or English lan guage . Besides that, publications , \nrespectively the interventions described within these publications  had to fulfill the following  \ncriteria  in order to be considered:  \n\u2212 Study type  \nRandomized, quasi -randomized, controlled, and uncontrolled clinical studies that explicitly \nexamined the severity of depressive symptoms as an outcome variable  were considered .  \n\u2212 Intervention format   \nTherapeutic content had to be  predominantly provided over the Internet, a computer , or a mobile \nphone, or, as in interventions using expert  system technology  [74], had to be  generated fully \nautomatized by a computer  and then delivered to the participa nt. Interventions where  the \nInternet, computer, and/or mobile phone were used only as a reminder  or as a medium for real -\ntime communication were not considered. Further, interventions  where Internet -, computer - or \nmobile phone -based content s were only used as an add- on to classical face- to-face therapies  \nwere not considered .  \nTable 1.

Keywords within columns were combined with \u201cOR\u201d, keywords from different columns were combined \nwith \u201cAND\u201d . 17 \n \n\u2212 Intervention e ffectiveness  \nInterventions were only considered if  there was evidence for their effectiveness in the form of \nsignificant reductions in depressive symptoms or at least small effect sizes in inter - or \nintragroup comparisons (corresponding to a Cohen\u2019s d \u2265 0.2 [75] ). \n\u2212 Intervention availability  \nBy the time the review paper was drafted, the interventions  had to be open to the public  in order \nto be considered for the review . This  was the case when 1) interventions  were accessible free \nor fee -based over the Internet, 2) interventions  were acquirable by private individuals on data \ncarriers, 3) physicians or health facilities could give access to interventions, 4) interventions \ncould be accessed by participating in scientific studies, or 5) interventions could be acquired by \norganizations, companies, or health facilities so that their members, staff, or patients  could use \nthem .  \n\u2212 Target group  \nInterventions were only considered if  they were evaluated with samples that included adults.  \nNo other restrictions in terms of target groups were defined.  \nAfter excluding duplicates, publications were selected in a four -step procedure. First, I sorted \nout publications that according to their title were clearly ir relevant to the review topic. Then, I \nand another psychologist  (DG) independently from one another examined the remaining \npublications concerning their potential relevance for the review topic on the basis of their title. \nInterrater -reliability determined by Cohen\u2019s Kappa was moderate (\u03ba = 0.56)  [76]. Afte r that, I \nexamined the abstract  of every publication that based on their title was deemed potentially \nrelevant by  either me or DG . If after that  the relevance of a publication remained questionable, \nthe abstract was also examined by DG. For publications  that after examining  the abstract \nremained potentially relevant for the review topic, I then examined the full text.  At first, I \nchecked if a specific intervention was named. If, instead, another publication was referenced, I \nchecked this for the name of the intervention. If the group of authors hinted at a specific \nintervention platform, I checked this platform for the intervention.  \nAfter identifying an intervention name, its availability was checked on the Internet. If \navailab ility was confirmed  and all  of the above mentioned criteria w ere fulfilled,  the 18 \n \nintervention was included into the review.  If availability was unclear, the authors of the related \npublications or e -mail addresses found on the Internet were contacted for more information.  \nIn addition to identifying intervention s via the intervention name  found in publications  or in \nsources  referenced in publications , I used the Beacon website [77]  as an information source to \nidentify interventions . The Beacon website provide s an overview over quality health  websites  \nand e- and m-health interventions  and evaluates the scientific evidence for their efficacy and  \neffectiveness  [77] .  \n \n2.2 Methods of s tudy 2  (Krause et al., 2019)  \nStudy  2 was a multicenter, single -arm pre- post intervention trial.  \n \nRecruitment  \nThe study was part of a conglomerate of two projects that  simultaneously screened for \nparticipants within a joint screening program . Two recruitment strategies were used: 1) a \nproactive recruitment in HCPs  and 2) a media recruitment to augment the sample and to allow \nfor comparisons with the target population. The media recruitment was exclusively done for  \nthe project described here.  Within the proactive recruitment, general hospital and general \nmedical practice patients w ere systematically screened for hazardous alcohol use and \ndepressive symptoms on three sites across Germany (Greifswald, T\u00fcbingen, L\u00fcbeck). \nScreenings were realized using handheld computers. For the media recruitment, study \nadvertisements were placed  in online (e.g., Facebook) and regional print media. Furthermore, \na press release was published that could be picked up by print media across Germany.  \nIndividuals interested in the study were able to contact study staff via e -mail or a toll free \ntelephone number during office hours. They were registered and then contacted for  a computer -\nassisted telephone interview (CATI) to determine their eligibility .  \nTo be eligible for the screening,  patients had to be between 18 and 64 years old. To be eligible \nfor study inclusion, screening participants 1) had to report hazardous drinking, initially defined \nas drinking more than 12 or 24 g (for women and men, respectively) of pure alcohol per day on \naverage and 2) had to have suffered at least one episode with at least subclinical depressive \nsymptoms during the 12 months prior to the screening. The latter was the case if within a period \nof at least 2 weeks at least two symptoms for major depression a ccording to the Diagnostic and 19 \n \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fourth edition (DSM -IV [78]) including depressed \nmood or anhedonia were present on mor e than half of the days [79] . \nAn interim analysis of 694 screenings showed that with the above mentioned alcohol crit erion, \na large proportion of individuals reporting regular binge drinking were not included. As this \nalso represents hazardous drinking, the alcohol -related inclusion criterion was adjusted by also \nincluding individuals who reported to binge drink, defined as drinking four drinks or more per \noccasion for women and five  drinks  or more for men [80] , at least once a month. Individual s \nwere excluded if evidence for a current severe depressive episode was present and if they used \nneither  a mobile phone  nor the Internet at least once a week.  HCPs were further excluded if \nthey were seeing a psychotherapist  and if there were signs of a moderate or severe AUD \naccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition [81]. For \nMVs , these exclusion criteria were not used. This allowed for more individuals to be included \ninto the study, thus enabling a more rigorous testing of the feasibility and functionality of the \nintervention and the surrounding study logistics. However, MVs were excluded if they were \nnot living in Germany.  \n \nProcedures for study participants  \nAfter the initial screening, participants were scheduled to take part in one baseline and three \nfollow -up CATIs, two (T1), four (T2), and six months later. After the final asse ssment, \nparticipants were invited to a post -intervention interview  to ascertain data on  intervention \nacceptability . \n \nSample  \nThe computer -based screening was completed by 2773 HCPs , of whom 55 (2.0%) fulfilled the \nfinal in - and exclusion criteria.  As binge drinking initially was not considered as an inclusion \ncriterion, eight (14.5%) of these HCPs were not detected as eligible. Another six (10.9%) were \nassigned to the other project  that screened for participants within the joint screening program . \nThe remaining 41 (7 4.5%) HCPs were offered to participate in our study.  Of the  27 (65.9%) \nHCPs who consented to participate, 19 (70.4%)  completed the baseline assessment. The media \nadvertisements led to 40 registered contact attempts by MVs. The initial screening was \ncompleted by 31 MVs , of whom 15 (48.4%) were eligible for study inclusion, consented to \nparticipate, and completed the baseline assessment.  All 34 baseline completers were invited to \nparticipate in the post -intervention interview (participation rate 94.1%; 17 HCPs, 15 MVs). The 20 \n \nfinal sample for the pre-post analyses consisted of the 30 participants (15 HCPs, 15 MVs) who \nprovided data at the 6 -month follow -up.  \n \nIntervention  \nThe intervention was a computer -based, fully automatized expert system [74]  based on the \ntranstheoretica l model of behavior change [82] . Utilizing data gathered in CATIs, it generated \nindividually tailored motivational feedback letters for participants. After base line, T1, and T2, \nparticipants received two feedback letters  each. In addition, they received weekly individually \ntailored short messages via mobile phone or e -mail ( cf. Supplementary figure 1). \nSupplementary t able 1 summarizes the basic intervention characteristics.  \nThe intervention consisted of an alcohol and a depression module ( Supplementary table 2). The \nalcohol module has already been found to reduce alcohol use among HCPs [83] . The depression \nmodule was developed for this project. Based on the work of Levesque et al. [84] , it was \nintended to address depressive symptoms by motivating individuals to implement evidence -\nbased depression preventive or ameliorating behaviors (DPBs) into their daily routine. The five \ntarget behaviors were: 1) obviate negative t houghts [27,85] , 2) engage in healthy, pleasant \nactivities on most days [86,87] , 3) practice stress management on most days [88- 90], 4) exercise \non most days [91- 93], and 5) getting help (professional or non- professional) when needed. A  \nmore  detailed description of the intervention is provided in the supplement ary materials  \n(Appendix ). \n \nMeasures  \n\u2212 Alcohol consumption  \nTo assess drinking behavior and to detect a moderate or severe AUD , the Alcohol Use Disorder \nIdentification Test (AUDIT [94] ) was used . It consists of 10 items asking for consumption \npatterns and experienced negative consequences  of alcohol consumption. Each item can be \nscored from 0 to 4 with a maximum AUDIT sum score of 40. A moderate or severe AUD was \nassumed if the score was 20 or higher [95] . In that case, screening participants were excluded \nfrom the study . The 6 -month follow -up assessment included the three consumption items of the \nAUDIT (AUDIT -C [96] ) only.  \nTo determine average intake of pure alcohol in grams per day, the categorical AUDIT -C items \nwere complemented by a continuous assessment of alcohol consumption. Thus, it was 21 \n \nspecifically asked how often participants drank alcohol and how many standard units of alcohol \nthey typically drank at one occasion ( Supplementary table 3). Average daily intake of pure \nalcohol was determined by calculating a quantity -frequency index assuming 10.5 g  of pure \nalcohol for one standard drink. To determine binge drinking, a gender -tailored  version of the \nAUDIT item 3 considering thresholds defined in the respective inclusion criterion was used \n[97]. \n\u2212 Depressive symptoms  \nDepressive symptoms were assessed with the eight -item version of the Patient Health \nQuestionnaire (PHQ -8 [79]). At the initial screening, prior to the presentation of the PHQ -8, \nparticipants answered three screening items from the depression section of the Munich \nComposite International Diagnostic Interview (M -CIDI [98]), which w ere adopted to the 12 \nmonths prior to the screening. If at least one of these items was endorsed, the PHQ -8 was \npresented.  \nIf participants reported that depressive symptoms were present within the past 2 weeks and the \nPHQ- 8 sum score of their most severe e pisode within the past 12 months was 20 or higher, they \nwere excluded as a current severe depressive episode had to be suspected.  \nThe b aseline PHQ -8 referred to the 2 weeks within the past 12 months in which the participant \nfelt worst. At follow -up, the PHQ- 8 referred to the 2 weeks within the past 6 months in which \nthe participant felt worst. In addition, lifetime diagnosis of depression and count of lifetime \nDSM -IV criteria for major depression were assessed using the depression section of the M -\nCIDI, w hich was included in the 6- month follow -up assessment.  \n\u2212 Motivation to change drinking behavior and usage of depression preventive behaviors   \nMotivation to change drinking behavior and usage of DPBs were assessed on the basis of \nstaging algorithms ( [84,99] , Supplementary figure 2). DPB usage was assessed for each DPB \nseparately. Participants were classified as precontemplators, contemplators, preparators, or \nactors [82]. Per definition, precontemplators do not perform the target behavior and do not \nintend to do so anytime soon. Contemplators do not perform the target behavior but intend to \ndo so in the foreseeable future. Preparators intend to begin performing the target behavior \nwithin the near future (usually the next month) and actors already perform the target behavior.  22 \n \n\u2212 Acceptability  \nParticipants\u2019 evaluations of the intervention and intervention usage were chosen as main \nindicators for intervention acceptability. Using 5- point Likert scales  ranging from \u201c1, strongly \ndisagree\u201d to \u201c5, strongly agree\u201d , participants rated the information given in both i ntervention \nmodules in terms of how helpful, comprehensible, individualized, motivating, well formatted, \ninteresting, and important they found them. Participants were further asked to grade the \nintervention modules and the entire intervention on 6- point Li kert scales ranging from \u201c1, very \ngood\u201d to \u201c6, very bad\u201d.  \nParticipants\u2019 reading behavior was chosen as indicator for intervention usage. Participants were \nasked 1) how thorough they read the letters (I read them completely/partly/I did not read them), \n2) whether there were some letters they did not read at all (yes/no; only asked if item 1 was \nanswered with \u201cpartly\u201d), 3) whether they read some letters multiple times (yes/no), 4) whether \nthey kept the feedback letters (yes/no), and 5) whether they read the short messages \n(yes/partly/no).  \n \nStatistical analysis  \nTo test for differences between HCPs and MVs, t -tests for independent samples (interval data) \nand chi-square tests (categorical data) were used. If expected cell counts were below 5, Fisher\u2019s \nexact test was applied instead of the c hi-square test. To test for pre -post differences, t -tests for \ndependent samples (interval data) and the McNemar test for dependent sam ples (categorical \ndata) were used. Due to the explorative nature of the analyses, \u03b1-levels were not adjusted for \nmultiple comparisons.  \n \n2.3 Methods  of study 3  (Krause et al., 2018)  \nSample  \nData were obtained from the Pathological Gambling and Epidemiology study  [73]. Proactive \nand reactive recruitment strategies were used to reach a sufficient number of participants \nrepresenting different levels of gambling problems. Participants aged 14 to 64 years were drawn \nfrom the general population and from populations with a high risk of gambling  problems, that \nis, gambling location visitors, people undergoing treatment for pathological gambling, or \nvolunteers responding to media announcements. Participants from the general population, 23 \n \ngambling location visitors, and people undergoing treatment for pathological gambling were \nproactively recruited as study personnel actively reached out to them in the respective settings. \nThe remaining participants, for example, those responding to media announcements, were \nclassified as being reactively recruited. Data were acquired in a two -step procedure. First, \ngambling behavior and criteria for pathological gambling were assessed in a diagnostic \ninterview (n = 15775  participants ), mostly administered through telephone  (n = 15023, 95.2%) . \nPeople reporting gambling problems ( i.e., fulfilling one or more DSM -IV criteria for \npathological gambling ; n = 1796, 11.4% ) were then invited to an in- depth clinical interview \nconducted face -to-face. Of those eligible , 1188 (66.1%) individuals consented to participate. \nHowever, f or logistic reasons, the interviews were restricted to 594 (50.0%) individuals. \nAdditional data were collected via paper -pencil questionnaires. After exclusion of participants \nwith incomplete data, 506 (85.2%) participants remained in the final analysis sample. For \nfurther d etails on the selection process , see Meyer et al.  [73] . \n \nMeasures  \n\u2212 Symptoms of pathological gambling \nSPGs (range: 1 -10) were assessed using an adaptation of  the gambling section of the World \nMental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview  version 3.0  [73,100] , mostly \nadministered in a CATI . For participants recruited in inpatient facilities, it was included in the \nclinical interview, which was held as a computer -assisted personal interview at the respective \nfacility.  \n\u2212 Ruminative brooding and reflection \nRumination including its subfactors brooding and reflection was assessed using the German 10 -\nitem Response Style Questionnaire  (RSQ -10D [101] ). Each subscale comprised five items, \nwhich were answered on a Likert scale ranging from \u201c 1, almost never \u201d to \u201c4, almost ever \u201d. \nThus, sum scores for both subscale s ranged from 5 to 20. The RSQ -10D was administered as a \npaper -pencil questionnaire.  \n\u2212 Depressive symptoms  \nDepressive symptoms (range: 0 -9) were assessed using the depression section of the M -CIDI, \nwhich  was administered face -to-face.  \n 24 \n \nStatistical analysis  \nTo analyze the relationship between SPG s (dependent variable) and both rumination subfactors \n(independent variables), I ran quantile regressions (QRs) using Stata\u2019s qreg  procedure. QR \nallows to model the conditional median or any other quantile , whereas ordinary least squares \nregression provides estimates of conditional means [102] . QR was preferred over ordinary least \nsquares  regression because of the multimodal and left -skewed distribution of SPG s as the \ndependent measure i n the sample. This is in contrast to the right skewed distribution in the \ngeneral population and a consequence of the sampling design including additional recruitment \nchannels with an increased prevalence of individuals with severe gambling problems. QR \nallows to adequately analyze such skewed and non -normal data. Another advantage of QR is \nthat it allows to explore associations along the whole distribution of the dependent variable by \nrunning a series of separate QRs for different quantiles [103] .  \nI first analyzed the association of SPG s with the rumination subfactors and each of the other \ncovariates using un ivariate median regression analys es. Then, a multivariate median regression \nwas computed with depression severity (number of DSM -IV symptoms), sociodemographics \n(age, sex, education level, employment status, marital status, migration background), and \nrecru itment strategy (proactive vs. reactive) included as covariates besides both rumination \nsubfactors. Finally, the multivariate QR was repeated with quantiles representing the number \nof SPG s in the sample. To determine those quantiles , I calculated the cumulative percentages \nof participants reporting the respective number of symptoms. This quantile selection allows to \nspecifically analyze the relevance of the independent variables at any severity level represented \nby the dependent variable. For each quan tile a separate multivariate QR was conducted.  25 \n \n3. RESULTS  \n \n3.1 Results of s tudy 1  (Krause et al., 2016)  \nIdentified interventions  and their basic characteristics  \nIn total, the abstracts of 418 publications were analyzed, of which 210 were selected for a full  \ntext analysis. Finally , 86 publications were deemed relevant for the review. Within the 86 \npublications, 37 relevant interventions were identified (Supplementary table 4). Of those, 30 \n(81.1%)  were  available in English. Interventions were further available in Dutch  (n = 5, 13.5%) , \nGerman  (n = 3, 8.1%) , Spanish (n = 3, 8.1%) , Swedish (n = 3, 8.1%) , Finnish (n = 2, 5.4%), \nChinese  (n = 2, 5.4%) , Italian  (n = 1, 2.7%) , Greek  (n = 1, 2.7%) , Norwegian  (n = 1, 2.7%) , and \nArabic (n = 1, 2.7%) . Twenty -eight (75.7%) interventions were monolingual. The remaining \nnine (24.3%)  interventions were offered in two ( n = 4, 10.8%)  to four  (n = 1, 2.7%)  languages. \nAmong the 37 interventions, 35 (94.6%) were Internet - and two ( 5.4%) smartphone -based.  The \nmajority of interventions ( n = 27, 73.0%) addressed adults from the general population. Other s \ntarget ed, for example,  mothers with postpartum  depression, diabetics, depressed individuals \nwith substance misuse , and survivors of traumatic events.   \nCognitive behavior therapy was the concept that the majority of interventions ( n = 19, 51.4%) \nnamed as their  theoretical background. Other specific backgrounds that were mentioned were, \nfor example, problem solving treatment, acceptance and commitment therapy, interpersona l \ntherapy, mindfulness training, and  positive psychology . Six (16.2%) interventions were using \ncombinations of different methods (e.g.,  Deprexis  [104] ).  \nThe effort associated with using interventions varied from visit ing a psychoeducation website  \nfor one time only  (e.g., BluePages [105] ) to regularly working on lessons  that build up on one \nanother and that included complementary tasks (e.g., Deprexis [104] ). Most  interventions (n = \n27, 73.0%) had a modular design. The spectrum of entry ways was manifold, including, for \nexample, referral s of the treating physician (Colour Your Life  [106] ) and the  participation in \nevaluation studies (e.g., The Wellbeing Course [107] ). For most  interventions ( n = 24, 64.9%), \nhuman guidance was not an integral component. When offered outside of evaluation studies,  \nthe majority of the  guided interventions were fee -based.  \n 26 \n \nInterventions available in German  \nThe three interventions available in German were Deprexis [104] , Staerkentraining [108] , and \nAchtsamkeit App [109] .

Furthermore,  \nthere were more MVs than HCPs who drank more than 12/24 g of pure alcohol per day ( p < 27 \n \n0.001). In terms of individuals who report ed to  binge drink at least once a month, HCPs and \nMVs did not differ ( p = 1.000). When excluding MVs with an AUDIT score of \u2265 20 ( n = 4) \nfrom the analyses, that is , applying the same inclusion criterion for both groups, the results \nremained unchanged. M otivation to change drinking behavior was significantly related to the \nrecruitment strategy ( p = 0.002 [Fisher\u2019s exact test]). MVs in general  show ed a higher \nmotivation to change their drinking behavior than HCPs ( Supplementary t able 5). In terms of \ndepressive symptoms, the mean PHQ -8 score was numerically  higher in MVs than in HCPs, \nbut the difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.079; Table 3 ). However, M -CIDI data \nshowed a higher lifetime burden by depressive symptoms in MVs compared to HCPs (lifetime \nfulfilled DSM -IV criteria for major depression : p = 0.006). In terms of the number of DPBs \nused, HCPs and MVs did not differ (HCPs: M  = 2.6, SD = 1.2; MVs: M  = 2.8, SD = 1.3; p = \n0.658). \nAt follow -up, MVs showed significant declines in average daily consumption ( p = 0.034), \nparticipants drinking more than 12/24 g of pure alcohol per day ( p = 0.002) , and drinking days \nper month ( p < 0.001), leading to HCPs and MVs no longer differing on these variables ( p = \n0.877, p = 1.000, and p = 0.733, respectively). The p ercentage of participants who reported to \nbinge drink at least once a month was reduced in both subsamples (HCPs: p  = 0.016, MVs: p = \n0.031). Again, subsamples did not differ in terms of binge drinking ( p = 1.000). When excluding \nMVs with an initial AUDIT score of \u2265 20 from the analyses, differences between subsamples \non alcohol consumption- related variables remained insignificant . Motivation to change \ndrinking behavior , at follow -up, was no t related to recruitment strategy ( p = 0.110 [Fisher\u2019s \nexact test]). Mean PHQ -8 scores showed that both groups experienced significantly less severe \ndepressive symptoms during the intervention per iod compared to the preceding 12 months \n(HCPs: p = 0.020, MVs: p < 0.001). The mean number of DPBs used significantly increased to \n3.3 ( SD = 1.5, p = 0.044) for HCPs and 3.6 ( SD = 0.8, p = 0.005) for MVs. Again, the mean \nnumber of DPBs used did not differ between HCPs and MVs ( p = 0.551).  \nOverall , the intervention as a whole  as well as the intervention modules received positive ratings \nfrom study participants (Table 3).  In the total sample, the information given in the alcohol \nmodule were rated as absolutely comprehensible  (M = 4.9, SD = 0.3) and as rather helpful  (M \n= 3.9, SD = 1.0), well formatted  (M = 4.5, SD = 0.7), interesting ( M = 3.8, SD = 0.9), and \nimportant  (M = 4.0, SD = 1.0). However, MVs deemed the information in the alcohol module \nsignificantly more helpful ( p = 0.043), individualized ( p = 0.041), motivating ( p = 0.021), \ninteresting ( p < 0.001), and important ( p = 0.005)  than HCPs . Furthermore, the alcohol module 28 \n \nreceived a significantly better overall rating from MVs than from HCPs ( p = 0.012). The \ninformation given in the depression module were rated as absolutely comprehensible  (M = 4.8, \nSD = 0.5) and as rather helpful  (M = 3.5, SD = 0.9), individualized (M = 3.6, SD = 0.8), well \nformatted  (M = 4.3, SD = 0.7), interesting  (M = 3.7, SD = 0.9), and important  (M = 4.0, SD = \n0.7) by the total sample. HCP and MV ratings did not differ for this module  (overall module \nrating: p = 0.231) . Reading behavior was significantly related to recruitment strategy in that \nmore MVs than HCPs reported to have read the letters completely ( p = 0.013). No further \ndifferences were observed in terms of reading behavior.  \nTable 3.

The association s were  \npositive for all of these quantiles, meaning that i ncreases in ruminative broodi ng were \nassociated with increases  in the severity of gambling problems at almost every severity level of \nproblem gambling. For ruminative reflection , there was a statistically significant association \nwith SPG s only at the quantile related to six SPG s. This  association was negative, meaning that \nincreases  in ruminative reflection  were  associated with decreases  in the severity of gambling \nproblems at this quantile.  The number of depressive symptoms was significantly associated \nwith SPG s at the quantiles relat ed to four and seven or more SPG s. All of the se associations \nwere positive.   \n \nTable 5.

DISCUSSION  \n \nThis thesis explored the application of e -health interventions in the treatment and prevention of \ndepressive symptoms and addictive behaviors , as well as rumination as a probable common \ncause underlying their prevalent comorbidity . The data revealed three main findings . 1) Despite \nan intense increase in research activities in the field of e -health interventions in recent years, \nthe availability of publicly accessible evidence -based  e-health interventions  to address \ndepressive symptoms , especially for non -English -speaking populations, was low. 2) The newly \ndeveloped computer -based expert system intervention simultaneously targeting hazardous \nalcohol consumption and depressive symptoms was technically and logistically feasible, \nacceptable, and might have the potential to reduce hazardous consumption and depressive \nsymptoms . Observed differences between the proactively and reactively recruited subsamples \nshow ed that the  recruitment strategy applied when preliminary  testing interventions is an \nimportant factor that potentially influenc es intervention development. 3) Ruminative brooding , \nin contrast to reflection , was significantly associated with gambling behavior , thus providing  \nfurther evidence that aspects of  rumination  may constitute a common cause of depressi on and \naddictive behaviors  that should be considered as a  target for combined treatment and prevention \napproaches .  \n \n4.1 General discussion  \nPublicly accessible evidence- based e-health interventions for depressive symptoms  \nWithin the literature search,  37 interventions for which there was evidence that they can be \neffective in reducing depressive symptoms  were identified . Of those, only three were available \nin German , of which only one , namely  Deprexis  [104] , had a particularly solid evidence  base,  \nmeaning that its  effectiveness has been demonstrated in three randomized controlled trials . By \nnow, the effectiveness of Deprexis has further been demonstrated meta- analytically [110] .  \nSince my literature search, the number of publicly accessible e -health interventions  for which \nthere is evidence that they can effectively reduce depressive symptoms has improved for \nGerman -speaking  populations (e.g., [111- 115]). While effective interventions are available and \neven the S3 -Guideline for unipolar depression [116]  recognizes e-health interventions  as a \nuseful means to address at least mild depressive symptoms within the watchful waiting  phase , \nit remains unclear how e -health  treatments might be implemented into the German health care 33 \n \nsystem . Given that e -health  interventions have been shown to be effective in different disease \nphases [117]  and severity levels, including even severe depressive symptoms [118] , the ir \npossible applications  within the health care system  seem manifold. Providing access to an e-\nhealth  intervention as adjunct to usual care has recently been shown to be effective in a German \nprimary care sample consisting of patients with mild to moderately severe depressive symptoms \n[113] . E-health interventions might further be convenient to bridge the time to the beginning of \noutpatient psychotherapies [119] . However, a pilot implementation study conducted in \nGermany that address ed this topic found no significant symptom improvements in patients \nwaiting for psychotherapy after they used one specific  self-guided e-health intervention [119] . \nThis le d the authors to conclude  that the promising results of randomized controlled trials  \nconcerning the effectiveness of e -health interventions are not simply  transferable to the routine \ncare situation [119] . To answer the question of how to best implement e -health interventions \ninto routine care , more research is needed [119] .  \n \nFeasibility, acceptability , and potential effectiveness of the  newly developed expert system for \ncomorbid hazardous alcohol use  and depressive symptoms  \nThe pre -post pilot trial show ed that the newly developed intervention might have the potential \nto reduce hazardous alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms in differently recruited \nsubsamples. In terms of alcohol consumption, significant declines were observed in both \nsubsamples concerning the proportion of participants reporting regular binge drinking and in \nthe media recruited sample ( MVs ) regarding  average daily consumption. A s for the patient \nsample ( HCPs) hazardous consumption was predominantly characterized by binge drinking  but \nnot by average daily consumption levels , the less extensive changes in consumption patterns in \nHCPs can be attributed to a floor effect. D epressive symptoms were significantly reduced in \nboth subsamples. Furthermore, HCPs and MVs significantly increased the number of DPBs \nused. The se results gave support to the idea of confronting depressive symptoms by fostering \nthe use of DPBs with motivation- based  programs [84] . \nThe predominantly positive ratings the intervention received from both subsamples showed \ngood intervention acceptability. However, as MVs compared to HCPs rat ed the alcohol module \nmore positive and bus ied themselves more with the intervention materials, hi gher overall \nacceptability in MVs than in HCPs  was inferred . The observation that  attrition was restricted to \nHCPs  supported this conclusion. Differences in  baseline motivation to change alcohol  \nconsumption, which was higher in MVs , might explain these findings  [120- 123]. Future 34 \n \nversions of the intervention should include elements that have the potential to further improve \nretention rates. Retention of less motivated participants might be improved by implementing \nvarious options to personalize the intervention experience. For example, participants could be \noffered to choose a preferred information delivery format, to define how often and ove r which \nchannels they want to be contacted, or to decide which intervention elements they deem relevant \nfor themselves and thus want to receive [124] . Improved retention might further be achieved by \nadding g amification features or social networking options to interventions . However, more \nresearch is needed to explore the benefit s of such design elements [125] .  \nIn terms of fe asibility, the pre -post pilot trial show ed that the intervention was technically and \nlogistically feasible. However, the substantial efforts needed to identify eligible subjects among \nroutine care patients  by means of systematic proactive screenings  limite d its feasibility as a \nstandalone intervention. By expanding screenings to multiple health risk factors for which \ncomputerized interventions are provided in case of positive screening  results , the cost -benefit \nratio of utilizing a proactive screening approach in routine care  might be improved [126] .  \nStudy 2 showed the importance of the sample selection when preliminary testing behavioral \ninterventions. The proactive and reactive recruitments  led to substantially different samples in \nterms of problem severity, motivation to change, pre -post intervention changes, and attitudes \ntoward the intervention. According to t he ORBIT model for developing behavioral \ninterventions [69] it is sufficient to rely on a convenience sample instead of a representative \none when preliminary testing interventions . However,  the data presented in this thesis suggest ed \nthat at least for early interventions that also address individuals not yet motivated to show a \nspecific target behavior , such an approach might lead to biased conclusions about the potential \nof interventions. To avoid this, preliminary tests  of intervent ions should be conducted with  \nthose individuals who are to be targeted by the final intervention. \n \nAssociations of the rumination subfactors brooding and reflection with symptoms of \npathological gambling  \nStudy 3 found that ruminative brooding , independently  from depressive symptoms and \nsociodemographic factors , was positively associated with SPGs, thus supporting previous \nfindings hinting at a direct link between ruminative brooding  and gambling behavior [34] . The \nresults concerning the association of ruminative reflection  and SPGs were inconclusive. \nHowever, in accordance with previous findings [34] , the data rather suggested that ruminative \nreflection  is of no special relevance in SPGs.   35 \n \nThe results of s tudy 3 provided further evidence that rumination, especially its subfactor \nbrooding, not only is an important contributor to depression [29]  but also to addictive behaviors. \nThus, the assumption that rumination may constitute a common cause of depression and \naddictive behaviors was supported. Rum inative tendencies  should be considered as a possible \ntarget for e-health interventions aiming at the treatment and prevention  of comorbid depressive \nsymptoms and addictive behaviors. In addition, study 3 provided further evidence that \nindividuals with a high tendency to ruminate , especially  to brood, should in general be \nconsidered as an important  target population for program s aiming at the prevention of addictive \ndisorders . \nStudy 3 expanded  previous findings showing  associations between rumination and addictive \nbehaviors [30-33] in that it revealed  associations between rumination and a non- substance -\nrelated addictive behavior. It has been hypothesized that substance use is a means to alleviate \nruminative thoughts and the distress associated with rumination [30- 33]. Gambling might serve \nthe same purpose. Its mind altering qualities have previously been compared to those of alcohol \nor drugs [127]  and it has been recognized as a mood enhancing activity [128- 130]. \n \n4.2 Practical implications  \nEvidence suggests that e -health interventions can be successfully utilized in the treatment and \nprevention of depressive symptoms and addictive behaviors. It is time for German health care \npolicy makers  to define how e -health interventions can be implemented into routine care.  One \nimportant question that needs to be answered is how to identify  patients that could be offered \naccess to such interventions . To be effective on a population level, interventions should be made \navailable to everyone who could benefit from them, regardless of their initial motivation to \nshow a specific health behavior [131] . As s tudies have shown insufficient recognition of \ndepressive symptoms and alcohol problems by physicians [132- 134], solely relying on the \nphysicians referral based on accidental detection will leave the potential of e-health \ninterventions to increas e public health unused.  Systematic proactive approaches could improve \ndetection of relevant health risks or disease symptoms. P rimary care patients could participate \nin annual health risk screenings conducted via tablet PC in the waiting room. In case of critical \nfindings (e.g., severe depression, dependence) that warrant immediate action by the physician , \nthe results could be directly discussed within doctor\u2019s consultation. Otherwise, w ritten feedback \nof the results could be provided via feedback letters , which, for example, coul d be handed out \nby the nurses or send to the patients\u2019 e -mail address . Based on the screening results , the 36 \n \nfeedback could include suggestions for digital interventions that address the health risks \nidentified within the screenings. Access to interventions could be provided via digital \napothecaries [135] . To enhance prevention of depressive and addictive disorders, screenings \nshould also inquire ruminative tendencies. In case of positive screening results, preventive \nefforts could include teaching mindfulness -based meditation strategies  as these have been \nshown to effectively reduce rumination [136,137] . Transferring mindfulness -based approaches \nto e-health interventions has been shown to be feasible [109,138,139] . However, the possible \neffects of mindfulness -based e-health interventions on ruminative tendencies have yet to be \ninvestigated . \n \n4.3 Limitations  \nSeveral limitations have to  be considered for the findings reported in this thesis . First, d ue to \ntechnological progress and the  ongoing extensive research activities in the field of e -health \ninterventions , the results presented in study 1 represent  only a snapshot in time . Regular updates \nare needed to identify new interventions and to keep  the information on accessibility and \neffectiveness up to date. Second, the data analyzed in study 2 and study 3 solely relied on self -\nreports, thus being prone to a social desirability bias. Third, study 2 focused on the feasibility \nand acceptability of a combined intervention addressing depressive symptoms and alcohol \nconsumption in differently recruited subsamples. Due to the lack of a control group, conclusions \nconcerning intervention effectiveness cannot  be made. The observed pre -post differences might \nrather be explained by  a regression to the mean than  the intervention. Fourth, study 2 did not \nconsider qualitative data to evaluate intervention acceptability . These could have revealed \nfurther relevant aspects not covered by the standardized assessments , which might have led to \ndifferent conclusions on intervention acceptability . Fifth, due to the small sample size of study \n2, the generalizability of the results to large populations is limited. Sixth, the association \nbetween ruminative brooding  and SPG s found in study 3 might  be better explained by other \nunmeasured factors . Seventh, a substantial part of subjects who were called in the telephone \nsurvey of study 3 refused to participate, probably leading to a selection bias in the general \npopulation sample . Eighth, study 3 failed to realize a random sample of gambling location \nvisitors and inpatients and the reactively recruited subsamples were per se self -selected. Thus, \nalthough the analyses were statistically controlled for recruitment strategy, generalization of \nfindings to the population level might not be valid. Ninth, due to the cross -sectional nature of \nthe data analyzed in study 3, a causal interpretation of the associations found is precluded.  37 \n \n4.4 Conclusions  \nIn conclusion, e-health interventions s how great potential in the treatment and prevention of \ndepressive symptoms and addictive behaviors. However, more research is needed to clarify how \nto make the most of this potential. T he results presented in this thesis show ed that 1) publicly \naccessible evidence -based e-health interventions for the treatment and prevention of depressive \nsymptoms were available. However, the supply in the German language area was low. \nTranslations and cultural adaptations of the foreign -language interventions  for German -\nspeaking populations  could facilitate  a substantial  increase of the number  of interventions  \navailable. 2) The newly developed computer -based expert system intervention simultaneously \ntargeting hazardous alcohol consumption and depres sive symptoms was technically and \nlogistically feasible and acceptable to proactively and reactively recruited samples. \nFurthermore, some substantial pre -post differences showed that the intervention might have the \npotential to reduce hazardous alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms  in differently \nrecruited subsamples, including samples unselected in terms of their motivation to change . The \nobserved differences between subsamples showed that the developers of early interventions that \nalso address  individuals not yet  motivated to show specific target behavior s should preliminary \ntest their interventions on the ir intended  target populations  to avoid biased conclusions about \nthe potential of  interventions . The results of the non- randomized pre -post pilot study  justified  \nto pilot test a refined version of the  intervention within a randomized controlled design. A \ncorresponding follow -up study has been initiated [126] . 3) Rumination, especially its subfactor \nbrooding might be important in the development and maintenance  of problem gambling . This \nfinding adds to existing evidence that rumination not only is a risk factor for depression but also \nfor addictive behaviors . As a probable underlying common cause , rumination should be \nconsidered as a target for future e -health interventions aiming a t the treatment and prevention  \nof comorbid conditions . To fully utilize the potential of e -health interventions, it is important \nto clarify how to best provide these interventions to those in need. Furthermore, it needs to be \nexplored how to optimize  intervention designs  in order to maximize their reach  and the retention \nof participants once they started an intervention. Thereby, special attention should be paid to \nindividuals that are not yet motivated to address specific health risks or disease symptoms. \nAnswering these questions may substantially improve the public health impact of e -health \ninterventions. \n   38 \n \n5.

The re-\nfore we conducted a systematic literature research. We identi\ufb01  ed 37 interventions which are mostly (51,4 %) based on methods of cognitive \nbehavioral therapy alone. For the English language area there is a broad spectrum of internet-, computer- and smartphone-based interventions \nfor patients with depressive symptoms. In the German language ar ea availability of such interventions is still scarce. Linguist ic and cultural \nadaptations of the foreign-language intervention systems would facilitate a substantial expansion of the available choices. In order to fully \nutilize the potential of computer-based interventions, it is important to clarify how to best provide these interventions to th ose in need.\nKeywords:  depression, internet-based therapy, online therapy, online intervention, review\n122 K. Krause et al.: Computergest\u00fctzte Interventionen bei depressiven Symptomen\nZeitschrift f\u00fcr Psychiatrie, Psychologie und Psychotherapie  (2016), 64(2), 121\u2013131 \u00a9 2016 HogrefeTherapien (Johansson & Andersson, 2012; Richards & \nRichardson, 2012).\nAuch bei grunds\u00e4tzlicher Verf\u00fcgbarkeit von geeigneten \ncomputergest\u00fctzten Interventionen ist eine systematische Einbindung in das profess ionelle Hilfesystem oder die \nSelbsthilfe notwendig, um eine reale Verbesserung der Versorgung Betroff  ener zu erm\u00f6glichen. Dies erfordert ein \nReferenzwerk f\u00fcr Betroff  ene und Akteure im Gesund-\nheitssystem, das die schnelle Identifi  kation qualitativ \nhochwertiger Angebote erlaubt. Es m\u00fcssen Informationen \u00fcber Inhalte, Zugangswege und Qualit\u00e4t im Sinne von Wirksamkeit gegeben werden.\nZiel dieser Arbeit ist es, einen \u00dcberblick zu internetba-\nsierten, computer- und mo biltelefongest\u00fctzten Interventi-\nonen zur Reduktion bzw. P r\u00e4vention depressiver Sympto-\nme bei Erwachsenen zu geben, deren Wirksamkeit in Studien aufgezeigt werden konnte und die zum Zeitpunkt der Entstehung dieser Arbeit f\u00fcr die \u00d6ff  entlichkeit zu-\ng\u00e4nglich waren. Deutschsprachige Programme sollen  ausf\u00fchrlicher betrachtet und in Bezug auf Medium, Ziel-gruppe, theoretischen Hintergrund, Umfang, Dauer, Zu-gangswege und Unterst\u00fctzung beschrieben werden.\nMethodik\nLiteratursuche und Auswahl \nder\u00a0Publikationen\nDie Literaturrecherche erfolgte am 30. September 2014 in \nden Datenbanken Web of Science und PubMed anhand der in Tabelle 1 aufgef\u00fchrten Suchbegriff  e. Entsprechend \nder Ziele dieser Arbeit wurden neben deutscher und engli-scher Sprache folgende Krit erien f\u00fcr auszuw \u00e4hlende Pub-\nlikationen festgelegt:\nStudientyp\nAusgew\u00e4hlt wurden randomis ierte, quasi-randomisierte, \nkontrollierte sowie nicht-kontrollierte klinische Studien, welche explizit die Auspr\u00e4gung der depressiven Sympto-matik als ein Outcome betrachten. Ausgeschlossen wur-den Arbeiten, die ausschlie\u00dflich die Entwicklung einer In-tervention oder Studienprotokolle beschreiben.\nInterventionsformen\nWir ber\u00fccksichtigten ausschlie\u00dflich Interventionen, bei \ndenen die therapeutischen Inhalte \u00fcberwiegend \u00fcber das Internet, einen Computer oder d as Mobiltelefon vermit-\ntelt oder aber, wie bei einem Expertensystem, automati-siert generiert und anschlie\u00dfend an den Patienten \u00fcber-mittelt werden. Interventionen, bei denen das Internet, der Computer und/oder das Mobiltelefon lediglich als \n Erinnerungshilfe dienen oder als Medium zur Echtzeit-kommunikation, fi  nden keine Ber\u00fccksichtigung. Des \nWeiteren werden nur Int erventionen mit Hinweisen auf \nihre Wirksamkeit ber\u00fccksichtigt, defi  niert als signifi  kante \nReduktion der depressiven Symptomatik oder mindes-tens kleinem Eff  ekt im Inter- oder Intragruppenvergleich \n(entsprechend einem d\u00a0\u2265 0.2; Cohen, 1988). Bei fehlender Angabe von Eff  ektst\u00e4rken berechneten wir diese, wenn \nm\u00f6glich, selbst. Ausgeschlossen wurden Arbeiten, in de-nen (1) die internetbasierten, computer- und mobiltele-fongest\u00fctzten Inhalte lediglic h einen Zusatz zum klassi-\nschen Face-to-Face-Ansatz darstellen und (2) deren Interventionen nicht f\u00fcr die \u00d6ff  entlichkeit zug\u00e4nglich \nsind.\nZielgruppeEs werden Interventionen mit Evaluation f\u00fcr vorrangig er-wachsene Altersgruppen ber\u00fccksichtigt.\nDie Auswahl der Publikationen erfolgte in vier Schritten \n(Abb. 1). Nach Ausschluss von Duplikaten wurden durch einen Diplom-Psychologen (KK) nicht themenrelevante Beitr\u00e4ge durch eine Sichtung der Titel aussortiert. Danach wurden die verbleibenden Beitr \u00e4ge durch den Erstautor \nund eine weitere Diplom-Psychologin unabh\u00e4ngig vonein-ander anhand ihrer Titel auf ihre potenzielle Relevanz ge-\npr\u00fcft. Dabei ergab sich eine \u00fcber Cohen's Kappa bestimm-te \u00dcbereinstimmung von \u03ba\u00a0= 0.56. Anschlie\u00dfend wurden \ndie Abstracts aller Beitr\u00e4ge, die zuvor von mindestens  einem der Beurteiler als pot enziell relevant erachtet wur-\nden, durch den Erstautor gepr\u00fcft. Bei fraglicher Relevanz erfolgte zudem eine Begutachtung des Abstracts durch die Mitarbeiterin.\nBei den nach Durchsicht der Abstracts als potenziell re-\nlevant klassifi  zierten Studien erfolgte die Pr\u00fcfung des \nVolltextes. Dabei wurde zun\u00e4chst darauf geachtet, ob eine konkrete Intervention benannt wurde. Bei Verweis auf Tabelle 1. Schl\u00fcsselbegriffe der Literatursuche.

Ergaben sich aus \nder Autorengruppe Hinweise auf eine Interventionsplatt-form, wurde dort nach der Intervention gesucht.\nNach Identifi  zierung des Interventionsnamens erfolgte \nim Internet die Abkl\u00e4rung der Verf\u00fcgbarkeit. War diese neben allen weiteren Krit erien gegeben, nahmen wir das \nProgramm in unsere \u00dcbersicht auf. Bei unklarer Verf\u00fcg-barkeit erfolgte eine Recherche \u00fcber die in der Publikation genannten Autoren oder im Internet benannte E-Mail-Ad-ressen. Beschrieb eine Publikation eine Anpassung eines verf\u00fcgbaren Programms an die kulturellen Besonderhei-ten einer Nation, wurde diese ber\u00fccksichtigt, auch wenn die Intervention in dieser Variante nicht verf\u00fcgbar war. In diesem Sonderfall wurde sie der urspr\u00fcnglichen Interven-tion zugeordnet.\nZus\u00e4tzlich erfolgte ein Abgleich mit der Beacon-Web-\nseite (Christensen et al., 2010), deren Ziel es ist, einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber Internetseiten zur psychischen Gesund-heit zu liefern. Eine Limitation dieser Webseite ist ihre fehlende Aktualit\u00e4t in Form einer weitestgehenden Be-\ngrenzung auf Arbeiten, die bis 2012 erschienen. Weiter-hin haben wir im Rahmen der Literaturrecherche gefun-dene Studienprotokolle nach in Entwicklung befi  ndlichen \ndeutschsprachigen Interventionen durchsucht und wer-den auf diese hier n\u00e4her eingehen. Programme, die in an-deren Sprachen bereits erfolgreich auf ihre Wirksamkeit untersucht wurden und f\u00fcr die eine deutschsprachige Umsetzung zeitnah erwartet wird, werden ebenfalls be-trachtet.Ergebnisse\nInternational verf\u00fcgbare Interventionen\nAnzahl an Interventionen und SprachenEine Auswertung der Abstracts erfolgte bei 418 Arbeiten. Von diesen wurden 210 f\u00fcr die Volltextanalyse ausge-w\u00e4hlt. Die zuvor defi  nierten Kriterien wurden von 86 Ar-\nbeiten erf\u00fcllt. Eine Publik ation konnte nur aufgrund des \nAbgleichs mit der Beacon-We bseite (Christensen et al., \n2010) einer Intervention zugeordnet werden. Insgesamt wurden 37 Interventionen identifi  ziert.\nUnter allen 37 Interventionen sind 30 englischsprachig. \nWeitere 5 sind in niederl\u00e4ndischer, jeweils 3 in deutscher, spanischer oder schwedischer, je 2 in fi  nnischer oder chi-nesischer und je eine in italienischer, griechischer, norwe-gischer oder arabischer Sprache verf\u00fcgbar. Von den Inter-ventionen sind 28 in nur einer Spr achausgabe erh\u00e4ltlich. \nDie verbleibenden neun Interventionen werden in zwei \n(n\u00a0 = 4) bis vier (n\u00a0 = 1) Sprachen angeboten. Eine Tabelle mit allen identifi  zierten Interventionen ist auf Anfrage bei \nden Autoren erh\u00e4ltlich.\nMedium und Zielgruppen\nUnter den 37 Interventionen wa ren 35 internet- und zwei \nsmartphonebasiert. Insgesamt 27 Programme sind an er-wachsene Personen der Allgemeinbev\u00f6lkerung gerichtet, zwei speziell an M\u00fctter mit postpartaler Depression und \njeweils eines an Paare oder Partnersuchende, Diabetiker, depressive Personen mit Substanzmissbrauch, sozial be-nachteiligte M\u00fctter mit Kindern im Vorschulalter, \u00dcberle-bende traumatischer Ereignisse, Personen mit ausl\u00e4ndi-schen Wurzeln, \u00e4ltere Personen der Allgemeinbev\u00f6lkerung und junge Erwachsene.\nTheoretischer Hintergrund\nDie Mehrzahl der Interventionen (19 Interventionen) be-nennt als theoretischen Hintergrund die kognitive Verhal-tenstherapie. Als weitere spezifi  sche Hintergr\u00fcnde werden \nProbleml\u00f6setraining, Akzeptanz- und Commitmentthera-pie, interpersonelle Therapie, Achtsamkeitstraining, das Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP, Markman, Stanley & Blumberg, 2001), die Me-thods of Levels Therapie (Carey, 2006) sowie die Metho-den der Positiven Psychologie angef\u00fchrt. Sechs Program-me verwenden unterschiedliche Kombinationen der genannten Methoden (z.\u2009B. Meyer et al., 2009). Eine Inter-vention legt das Transtheoretische Modell der Verhaltens-\u00e4nderung (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997) als wesentlichen Rahmen zu Grunde, eine weitere die sozial-kognitive The-orie der posttraumatisc hen Genesung (Benight & Bandu-Abbildung 1.

Auch f\u00fcr eine im \nWesentlichen auf Peer Support aufb  auende Webseite (Big \nWhite Wall; Lemma & Fonagy, 2013) gibt es Hinweise auf ihre Wirksamkeit.\nUmfang, Dauer und Zugangswege\nUmfang und Dauer der Interventionen variieren vom ein-maligen Besuch einer Psychoedukationswebseite (z.\u2009B. BluePages; Christensen et al., 2004) bis hin zur regel-m\u00e4\u00dfigen Bearbeitung aufeinander aufb  auender Lektio-\nnen mit erg\u00e4nzenden Aufgaben (z.\u2009B. Deprexis; Meyer et al., 2009). Einen modularen Aufb  au realisieren 27 der 37 \nInterventionen.\nBei den Zugangswegen reicht die Bandbreite von \n kostenfreien, f\u00fcr jeden zug\u00e4ngliche Interventionen (z.\u2009B.\u00a0MoodGYM; Christensen, Griffi   ths & Korten, 2002) \nbis hin zu kostenpfl  ichtigen Interventionen (z.\u2009B. \n BluesBegone; Purves, Bennett & Wellman, 2009) und jenen, die nur f\u00fcr die Einwohner bestimmter L\u00e4nder ge-\u00f6ff net sind (z.\u2009B. Mood Mechanic Course; Johnston et al., \n2014). Zu weiteren Progr ammen erhalten Patienten nur \ndurch \u00dcberweisung des behandelnden Arztes (Colour Your Life; Spek et al., 2007) oder durch die Teilnahme an Evaluationsstudien Zugang (z.\u2009B.

Zwischen den Modulen sind Hausaufgaben zu bearbeiten.\nOptional kann Deprexis mit c omputergenerierten indi-\nvidualisierten SMS-Nac hrichten erg\u00e4nzt werden (Meyer et \nal., 2015). Sie sollen die Patienten an Techniken aus dem Programm erinnern und zu ihrer Anwendung in der All-tagssituation ermuntern.\nUnterst\u00fctzung\nDeprexis ist als ungeleitetes Angebot ohne die Unterst\u00fct-\nzung eines Therapeuten nutzbar.\nWirksamkeit\nZum Zeitpunkt unserer Literaturrecherche lagen drei rando-\nmisierte Kontrollgruppenstudien (randomized con trolled trials, RCTs) vor, in denen die Wirksamkeit von Deprexis \nnachgewiesen werden konnte (Berger, Hammerli, Gubser, Andersson & Caspar, 2011; Meyer et al., 2009; Moritz, Schil-ling, Hauschildt, Schroeder & Treszl, 2012), wobei sich die gr\u00f6\u00dften Eff  ekte bei einer gest\u00fctzten Anwendung zeigten. \nMittlerweile wurden drei weitere Studien ver\u00f6ff  entlicht, \nwelche die Wirksamkeit von Deprexis belegen (Fischer et al., 2015; Meyer et al., 2015; Schr\u00f6der et al., 2014).\nVerf\u00fcgbarkeitDeprexis ist nicht im freien Verkauf erh\u00e4ltlich. Patienten k\u00f6nnen sich beim Arzt ein Hilfsmittelrezept ausstellen las-sen und dieses in einer Apotheke einl\u00f6sen. Daraufh  in er-\nfolgt durch die Entwickler- und Betreiberfi  rma (Gaia AG) \ndie Zusendung des f\u00fcr die Registrierung notwendigen Zu-gangsschl\u00fcssels. Alternativ kann sich ein Patient direkt mit der Gaia AG in Verbindung setzen. Ein Zugang kann f\u00fcr 90 Tage erworben werden. Anfallende Kosten m\u00fcssen zun\u00e4chst vom Patienten entrichtet werden. Eine R\u00fccker-stattung durch die Krankenversicherer ist im Einzelfall m\u00f6glich, jedoch nicht sicher (M. Zenker, pers\u00f6nl. Mittei-lung, M\u00e4rz 2015).\nStaerkentraining.chAufbau und wesentliche Inhalte\nDas Staerkentraining (Proyer, Gander, Wellenzohn & \nRuch, 2014) ist ebenfalls internetbasiert. Den theoreti-schen Hintergrund bildet die Positive Psychologie. Die Inhalte werden fortlaufend aktualisiert (R. Proyer, per-s\u00f6nl. Mitteilung, 10.2.2015). Die Durchf\u00fchrung der I ntervention ist in mehrere P hasen unterteilt (Gander, \nWellenzohn, Proyer & Ruch, 2014). In der Basisinforma-tionsphase sind Frageb\u00f6gen auszuf\u00fcllen, zu deren Ergeb-nissen der Nutzer am Ende des Programms eine R\u00fcck-meldung erh\u00e4lt. Um den Tr ainingsfortschritt verfolgen \nzu k\u00f6nnen, werden in der anschlie\u00dfenden Vorbereitungs-phase weitere Datenerhebungen durchgef\u00fchrt. Die dar-auf folgende einw\u00f6chige Trainingsphase dient dem Trai-ning sogenannter Charakterst\u00e4rken. Sie erfordert t\u00e4glich 5\u201315 Minuten. Nachbefragungen erfolgen bei Abschluss des Trainings sowie nach weiteren ein, drei und sechs Monaten (Nachbefragungsphase), bevor abschlie\u00dfend eine R\u00fcckmeldung \u00fcber individuelle Trainingserfolge ge-geben wird.\nUnterst\u00fctzungNutzer des ungeleiteten Staerkentrainings erhalten keine therapeutische Unterst\u00fctzung. Der Kontakt mit den Teil-nehmern beschr\u00e4nkt sich auf E-Mails, die an die Nachbe-fragungen erinnern sowie eine abschlie\u00dfende individuelle R\u00fcckmeldung der erhobenen Fragebogendaten.\nWirksamkeit\nProyer et al. (2014) konnten in einem RCT zeigen, dass die Inhalte des Trainings in einer Gruppe 50\u201379-j\u00e4hriger Frauen eff  ektiv depressive Symptome reduzieren konnten \n(Intergruppenvergleich: d\u00a0= 0.11 bis 0.78). In einem ande-ren RCT konnten Gander, Proyer, Ruch and Wyss (2013) bei einer 19\u201379-j\u00e4hrigen, \u00fcberwiegend weiblichen Stich-probe ebenfalls positive Eff  ekte der Mehrzahl der unter-\nsuchten Interventionen auf depressive Symptome nach-weisen (Intergruppenvergleich: d\u00a0= 0.01 bis 0.55).\nVerf\u00fcgbarkeit\nDie Teilnahme am Staerkentraining ist studiengebunden. Interessenten k\u00f6nnen sich online in eine Interessenten-liste eintragen.\nDie Achtsamkeit AppAufbau und wesentliche Inhalte\nDie Achtsamkeit App beinhaltet verschiedene Audiodatei-en, die dem Nutzer die Anwendung von Achtsamkeits-\u00fcbungen erm\u00f6glichen sollen (Ly et al., 2014). Dabei han-delt es sich um angeleitete und stille Meditationen unterschiedlicher L\u00e4nge (3, 5, 15 und 30 Minuten). Nutzer haben zudem die M\u00f6glichkeit, eigene Meditationen zu er-stellen (Google Play Store).\nUnterst\u00fctzung\nBenutzer der App erhalten keine Unterst\u00fctzung.\nWirksamkeit\nIn einer Studie von Ly et al. (2014) fanden sich gro\u00dfe Intra-gruppen-Eff  ektst\u00e4rken im Pr\u00e4-Post-Vergleich (BDI-II: d\u00a0 = \n126 K.

Die App zeigte vor allem bei Personen mit geringer Symptomauspr\u00e4gung Wirkung. Al-lerdings erhielten ihre Nutzer minimale therapeutische Unterst\u00fctzung in Form regelm\u00e4\u00dfiger kurzer Nachrichten und pers\u00f6nlicher Feedbacks \u00fcber ihre Arbeit mit der App. Dar\u00fcber hinaus wurde die Anwendung mit einem web-basierten Psychoedukationsteil kombiniert.

Es besteht aus f\u00fcnf interaktiven und mit \u00dcbungen angereicherten Modulen, deren Bearbeitung jeweils 30\u201345 Minuten in Anspruch nimmt. Zwischen diesen sollen Hausaufgaben bearbeitet werden.\nUnterst\u00fctzung\nBenutzer von MoodGYM erhalten keine Unterst\u00fctzung.\nWirksamkeit\nDie Wirksamkeit des Programms konnte in RCTs belegt werden (z.\u2009B.

Pr\u00e4vention von depressiver Ersch\u00f6pfung  (GET.\nON Mood Enhancer; Ebert et al., 2014), 2. Diabetes und De-\npressionen (GET.ON Mood Enhancer Diabetes; Nobis et al., \n2013) und 3. das Vorstation\u00e4re Training f\u00fcr Personen mit De-\npressionen (GET.ON Mood Enhancer-WL; Reins et al., 2013).\nDiese bestehen aus je 6 Kernmodulen, die in \u00fcblicher-\nweise 3\u20136 Wochen bearbeitet werden. Die Schwerpunkte sind Psychoedukation, Verhaltensaktivierung und Prob-leml\u00f6setraining. Im Programm f\u00fcr Diabetiker werden dia-betesspezifi  sche Themen erg\u00e4nzt. Regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Hausauf-\ngaben sollen die Integration d er erlernten F\u00e4higkeiten in \nden Alltag f\u00f6rdern. F\u00fcr eine umf assendere Darstellung der \nInhalte sei auf Nobis et al.

Die im Verlauf des Trainings dargebo-tenen Inhalte sind abh\u00e4ngig von den Antworteingaben der \nNutzer.\nUnterst\u00fctzung\nDie Kurse werden mit geringf\u00fcgiger Unterst\u00fctzung (E-Mail \noder Telefonkontakte) durchgef\u00fchrt, die vorrangig dazu dient, die Motivation der Teilnehmer aufrecht zu  erhalten. Das Programm f\u00fcr Diabetiker bietet au\u00dferdem t\u00e4gliche standardisierte SMS-Nachrichten, welche die Integration gelernter Strategien in den Alltag unterst\u00fctzen sollen.\nWirksamkeitF\u00fcr das Programm zur P r\u00e4vention depressiver Ersch\u00f6p-\nfung und das vorstation\u00e4re Training f\u00fcr Personen mit De-pressionen liegen bislang keine Studien zur Wirksamkeit vor. Zur Intervention f\u00fcr Diabetiker mit komorbider de-pressiver Symptomatik wurden erste Ergebnisse eines RCTs ver\u00f6ff  entlicht (Nobis et al., 2015), welche die Wirk-\nsamkeit belegen.\nVerf\u00fcgbarkeit\nDer Zugang ist an die Teilnahme an Studien gebunden. Interessenten k\u00f6nnen sich auf der Internetseite f\u00fcr zu-\nk\u00fcnftige Studien registrieren.\nDiskussion\nObwohl unsere Literaturrecherche f\u00fcr die letzten Jahre eine immense Zunahme der Forschungsaktivit\u00e4t zu On-\nK. Krause et al.: Computergest\u00fctzte Interventionen bei depressiven Symptomen 127\n\u00a9 2016 Hogrefe  Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Psychiatrie, Psychologie und Psychotherapie  (2016), 64(2), 121\u2013131line-Interventionen bei depressiven Symptomen zeigt, \nkonnten im Rahmen dieser Arbeit international nur 37 verf\u00fcgbare evidenzbasierte Programme identifi  ziert wer-\nden. Lediglich drei Interventionen sind in deutscher Spra-che verf\u00fcgbar. Nur bei einer kann von einer guten Evi-denzbasierung gesprochen werden (Deprexis; Meyer et al., 2009). Mit GET.ON und einer deutschen Version von MoodGYM befi  nden sich weitere aussichtsreiche deutsch-\nsprachige Angebote in der Entwicklung.\nBei Ber\u00fccksichtigung strengerer Kriterien zur Defi  nition \nder Wirksamkeit, wie sie b eispielsweise in der Evidenzba-\nsierten Medizin gefordert werden (Sackett, Rosenberg, Gray, Haynes & Richardson, 1996), h\u00e4tte eine weitaus gr\u00f6\u00dfere Anzahl an Interventionen ausgeschlossen werden m\u00fcssen. So wurden nur 23 der 37 Interventionen erfolg-reich in RCTs auf ihre Wirksamkeit untersucht. F\u00fcr vier Interventionen ist die Befundlage mit drei oder mehr RCTs besonders robust. Dies sind MoodGYM (6 RCTs; Christen-sen et al., 2004; Farrer et al., 2011; Hoifodt et al., 2013, Lintvedt et al., 2013; Powe ll et al., 2013; Twomey et al., \n2014), Beating The Blues (3 RCTs; Grime, 2004; Proudfoot et al., 2003, 2004), This Way Up Depression Course (3 RCTs; Perini, Titov & Andrews, 2009; Titov et al., 2010; Williams, Blackwell,  Mackenzie, Holmes & Andrews., 2013) und Deprexis, f\u00fcr das zum Zeitpunkt der Literatur-recherche 3 RCTs (Berger et al. 2011; Meyer et al., 2009; Moritz et al., 2012) vorlagen und f\u00fcr das seit dem drei wei-tere RCTs (Fischer et al., 2015; Meyer et al., 2015; Schr\u00f6der et al., 2014) ver\u00f6ff  entlicht wurden. In den kommenden Jah-\nren sollte der Fokus weniger auf einer Ausweitung des be-stehenden Spektrums an verf\u00fcgbaren Interventionen lie-gen, sondern eine Weit erentwicklung der Interventionen \nmit hoher Evidenzbasierung und ihre Bereitstellung f\u00fcr m\u00f6glichst weite Teile der Welt durch \u00dcbersetzungen und kulturelle Anpassungen angestrebt werden.\nDie Integration von Online-Interventionen in eine Rou-\ntineanwendung ist in einigen europ\u00e4ischen L\u00e4ndern, dar-unter Gro\u00dfbritannien (Beating the Blues) und die Nieder-lande (Colour Your Life), bereits erfolgreich vollzogen. Unter welchen Bedingungen eine Einbindung in das deut-sche Gesundheitssystem erfolg en kann, ist zum gegenw\u00e4r-\ntigen Zeitpunkt nicht gekl\u00e4rt.\nEin m\u00f6gliches Modell f\u00fcr die Implementierung von In-\nternettherapien in die Routineversorgung ist der Stepped Care-Ansatz (van Straten, Seekles, van't Veer-Tazelaar, Beekman & Cuijpers, 2010). Beim Auftreten depressiver Symptome w\u00fcrde aufgrund m\u00f6glicher Spontanremissio-nen zun\u00e4chst eine aktiv-abwartende Begleitung mit regel-m\u00e4\u00dfiger Kontrolle der Symptomentwicklung erfolgen. \nBleiben Verbesserungen aus, erhalten Patienten Zugang zu geleiteten, z.\u2009B. interne tbasierten Se lbsthilfeinterventi-\nonen. Erzielen auch diese keinen Erfolg, wird das thera-peutische Vorgehen intensiviert.Inwieweit der Einsatz v on Internettherapien auch bei \nschwereren Auspr\u00e4gungen indiziert ist, ist Gegenstand der aktuellen wissenschaftlichen Diskussion (van Straten et al., 2010). Untersuchungen konnten bereits zeigen, dass die Programme eff  ektiv vor einer weiteren Verschlechte-\nrung einer bestehenden leicht en depressiven Symptoma-\ntik sch\u00fctzen (Levesque et al., 2011) und bei unterschied-lich schweren Auspr\u00e4gungen depressiver Symptome wirksam sein k\u00f6nnen (Clarke et al., 2005, 2002; Meyer et al., 2015; Moritz et al., 2012; Proudfoot et al., 2003). In Anbetracht der bestehenden Un terversorgung depressiver \nSt\u00f6rungen stellen computer basierte Interventionen somit \neine m\u00f6gliche Minimalbehandlung dar.\nEine wichtige Frage ist, w er \u00fcber die Eignung eines Pa-\ntienten f\u00fcr die Internettherapie entscheiden soll (Brames-feld, Schafer, Stengler & Schomerus, 2014). In L\u00e4ndern, in denen computergest\u00fctzte Int erventionen bereits in das \nGesundheitssystem integr iert sind, reicht h\u00e4ufi  g eine \n\u00dcberweisung durch den Hausarzt. Aktuelle Befunde legen jedoch nahe, dass Haus\u00e4rzte d epressive Erkrankungen nur \nunzureichend identifi  zieren (Carey et al., 2014). Einen L\u00f6-\nsungsansatz f\u00fcr niederschwe llige Angebote k\u00f6nnte die In-\ntegration von Selbsttests zur Kl\u00e4rung von Fragen der Indi-kation und Kontraindikation darstellen. Es ist jedoch auch zu diskutieren, ob nicht generell ein vollst\u00e4ndig barriere-freier Zugang mit einhergehender hoher Reichweite be-vorzugt werden sollte.\nEine Limitation der vorliegenden Arbeit stellt die durch \nden technischen Fortschritt begr\u00fcndete begrenzte Dauer-haftigkeit unserer Ergebnisse dar. Entsprechend ist eine regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Aktualisierung in Hinblic k auf neue Interven-\ntionssysteme sowie Verf\u00fcgbarkeits- und Wirksamkeits-pr\u00fcfungen notwendig.\nInternetbasierte, comput er- und smartphonegest\u00fctzte \nInterventionen stellen trotz der noch off  enen Fragen ei-\nnen vielversprechenden Ans atz zur Behandlung und Pr\u00e4-\nvention depressiver Symptome dar. Ihre leichte Erreich-barkeit f\u00fcr weite Teile d er Bev\u00f6lkerung und ihr Potenzial, \nder Aufrechterhaltung und Progredienz depressiver Er-krankungen entgegenzuwirken, k\u00f6nnten sie zu einem n\u00fctzlichen Element sozialpsychiatrischer Versorgungs-modelle machen. Weiter voranschreitende technologi-sche Entwicklungen werden die M\u00f6glichkeiten von E- und M-Heal th-Interventionen in Zukunft weiter verbessern\n.\nDabei stellen die zunehmende M\u00f6glichkeit der Individua-\nlisierung und die Interaktivit\u00e4 t der Interv entionen zwei\nzentrale Ansatzpunkte f\u00fcr die Bereicherung psychiatri-\nscher Angebote dar. Um eine Verbesserung der Versor-gung von Patienten mit depressiven St\u00f6rungen durc\nh\ncomputergest\u00fctzte Interventionen zu erreichen, sc heint\ndie Frage essenziell, wie evidenz basierte Angebote f\u00fcr ge-\neignete Patientengruppen bereitgestellt werden k\u00f6nnen .\nAngesichts einer explodierenden Zahl von Health-Ap ps\n128 K.

To address the impor -\ntance of the sample selection when testing interventions, HCPs were compared to media recruited volunteers (MVs).\n \nMethod: In a multicenter screening program 2,773 HCPs were screened for hazardous drinking and depressive symp -\ntoms. MVs were recruited via media solicitation. Over a peri -\nod of 6 months, study participants received 6 individualized counseling letters and weekly short messages. Pre-post data\n \nwere analyzed for 30 participants (15 HCPs, 15 MVs). Interven -\ntion acceptability was assessed in post-intervention inter -\nviews conducted with 32 study participants. Results: MVs showed higher problem severity and motivation to change\n \nthan HCPs. Over the course of the intervention both subsam -\nples reduced regular binge drinking (HCPs: p = 0.016; MVs: \np = \n0.031) and depressiveness (HCPs: p = 0.020; MVs: p  < \nKrause et al. Eur Addict Res 2019;25:119\u2013131120\nDOI: 10.1159/0004990400.001). MVs further reduced average daily alcohol consump -\ntion (p  = 0.034). The intervention received positive ratings  \nfrom both subsamples, the alcohol module was rated more \nfavorably by MVs than by HCPs (p  = 0.012). Subsamples fur-\nther differed in terms of intervention usage (p  = 0.013). Con-\nclusion: The intervention was technically and logistically fea -\nsible, well accepted, and may have the potential to reduce hazardous drinking and depressive symptoms in different\n \npopulations. Subsamples differed in terms of problem sever -\nity, motivation to change, intervention usage, pre-post changes, and attitudes toward the intervention, showing\n \nthat intervention development should involve the intended target populations to avoid biased conclusions on interven -\ntion effectiveness and acceptability.\n\u00a9 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel\nIntroduction\nComputer-based interventions can effectively reduce \nalcohol consumption [1]. However, their impact might \nbe diminished by the concurrent existence of mental health problems. Numerous studies have shown that mental health problems are associated with cognitive and motivational patterns that could hinder individuals from successfully changing substance use behavior \n [2\u20134]\n. \nThus, in individuals with comorbid mental disorders, single-focused interventions targeting alcohol consump -\ntion might not be sufficient to change consumption pat -\nterns. Given the prevalent co-occurrence of substance use and depressive disorders \n[5], there is a need to de -\nvelop interventions addressing both alcohol consump-\ntion and depression. Evidence suggests that the com -\nbined treatment of comorbid alcohol use disorders \n(AUDs) and major depression is effective \n[6] and that \ncomputer-delivered treatments can be as effective as or even superior to therapist-delivered treatments [6\u20139]. To be effective on a population level, interventions should be made available to everyone who could benefit from them, regardless of their initial motivation to show a spe -\ncific health behavior [10]. A proactive approach that is facilitating access to interventions for every eligible indi -\nvidual can help to achieve this goal. Utilizing such an ap -\nproach in health care settings seems especially conve -\nnient. In Germany, 97% of the general adult population aged 18\u201379 have contact to a physician in in- or outpa -\ntient facilities at least once a year [11]. \nSingle-focused computer-based interventions using\n \nexpert system technology have been shown to reduce hazardous alcohol consumption [12] and depressive symptoms [13] in unselected health care samples. How -\never, it is unknown whether they can successfully be used to deliver a combined treatment addressing both\n \nconditions at once. Expert systems are fully automa -\ntized decision-making systems that utilize participant data (e.g., from telephone assessments) to produce\n \nhighly individualized feedback for participants (e.g., on drinking behavior) [14]. We developed a computer-based expert system intervention simultaneously target -\ning hazardous alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms in health care patients (HCPs). Guided by\n \nthe ORBIT model for developing behavioral treatments [15], we conducted a multicenter nonrandomized pre-post intervention trial to test the feasibility and accept -\nability of our intervention and to collect preliminary data on its potential effectiveness. By testing these as -\npects in proactively and reactively recruited subsam -\nples, we further investigated the importance of the sam -\nple selection in the early stages of developing and testing behavioral \ninterventions. Detailed descriptions of the \nstudy design, intervention, and results of the pilot study are provided.\nMaterials and Methods\nDrafting of this paper was oriented toward the reporting items \nof the CONSORT 2010 statement: extension to randomised pilot \nand feasibility trials [16] applicable to our nonrandomized \n \ndesign.\nRecruitment\nThe study was part of a conglomerate of 2 projects that si -\nmultaneously screened for participants on 3 sites across \n Germany: Greifswald (north-east, site 1, project 1 [described\n \nhere]), T\u00fcbingen (south-west, site 2, project 2), and L\u00fcbeck (north-west, site 3, recruitment only). As the pilot study aimed at providing initial descriptive and qualitative data no formal power analysis was conducted. To test the research logistics and technical functionality of our expert system, 40 participants were deemed sufficient. Two recruitment strategies were used: (1) a proactive recruitment in HCPs and (2) a media recruitment to augment the sample and to allow for comparisons with thetarget population.\nProactive RecruitmentFrom December 2015 to May 2016, patients of general hospi-\ntals and general medical practices were screened for hazardous al-cohol use and depressive symptoms. Screenings were realized us-ing handheld computers, provided to the patients at their sickbed or in the waiting room, respectively. \nThe hospital screenings on sites 1 and 3 took place from Mon-\nday to Friday. Each day, study staff was provided with a list of new patients on the wards and approached each of these. On site 2, study staff visited the clinic wards only on certain days. As they Targeting Alcohol and Depression with a \nComputer-Based Intervention121\nEur Addict Res 2019;25:119\u2013131\nDOI: 10.1159/000499040were not provided with a list of new patients to approach, they ap-\nproached all patients on the wards. At general practices, all patients in the waiting room were approached on all sites. \nOn sites 1 and 2, patients eligible for both project 1 and 2 were \nassigned to the project of the screening site. On site 3, assignment to projects was random. Due to an imbalance in the number of cases toward project 2, the assignment procedure was changed for the last 8 of 21 weeks of the field phase so that all patients eligible for both projects were assigned to project 1. Informed consent was obtained in writing.\nMedia Recruitment\nMedia recruitment took place from June to August 2016. It \nwas exclusively done for project 1. Study advertisements were placed on 3 German depression discussion boards, one local stu -\ndent discussion board, and the website of a German patient or -\nganization for individuals with depression. Additionally, the press office of the University Medicine of Greifswald published a\n \npress release that could be picked up by print media across \n Germany. Furthermore, the study was promoted on the Face -\nbook page of the University Medicine of Greifswald and in 3 re -\ngional newspapers.\nIndividuals interested in our study were able to contact us via \nE-mail or a toll free telephone number during office hours. Theywere registered and then contacted by study staff to do a comput-er-assisted telephone interview (CATI) to check for the relevantinclusion criteria. Informed consent was obtained verbally.\nInclusion and Exclusion CriteriaComputer-Based ScreeningTo be eligible for the screening, patients had to be between 18 \nand 64 years old. Exclusion criteria were being too sick to do the survey, being cognitively impaired, having insufficient German language skills or impaired senses (e.g., being blind). Hospital pa-tients in isolation (e.g., due to having a multiresistant hospital germ) were also excluded. In general medical practices we further excluded patients who had no contact with their physician, for ex-ample, when they came in only to pick up a prescription.\nStudy ParticipationTo be eligible for study inclusion, screening participants (1) \nhad to practice hazardous drinking, initially defined as drinking more than 12 or 24 g (for women and men, respectively) of pure alcohol per day on average and (2) had to have suffered at least one episode with at least subclinical depressive symptoms during the 12 months prior to the screening. The latter was the case if within a period of at least 2 weeks at least 2 DSM-IV [17] symptoms for major depression including depressed mood or anhedonia were present on more than half of the days [18]. \nAn interim analysis of 694 screenings showed that with the \nabovementioned alcohol criterion, a large proportion of individuals practicing regular binge drinking were not included. As this also rep -\nresents hazardous drinking, we adjusted the alcohol-related inclu -\nsion criterion by also including individuals who practiced binge drinking, defined as drinking 4 drinks or more per occasion for\n \nwomen and 5 or more for men [19], at least once a month. Individu -\nals were excluded if evidence for a current severe depressive episode was present (cf. Measures) and if they neither used a mobile phone\n \nnor the Internet at least once a week. HCPs were further excluded if they were seeing a psychotherapist and if there were signs of a mod -erate or severe AUD according to the DSM-5 [20]. For media re -\ncruited volunteers (MVs), we did not use these exclusion criteria. This allowed for more individuals to be included into the study, thus\n \nenabling a more rigorous testing of the feasibility and functionality of our intervention and the surrounding study logistics. However, MVs were excluded if they were not living in Germany.\nProcedures for Study Participants\nAfter the initial screening, participants were scheduled to take \npart in one baseline and 3 follow-up CATIs, 2 (T1), 4 (T2), and 6\u00a0months later. For hospital patients, the baseline assessment was scheduled 14 days after the screening to make sure they were dis -\ncharged. Patients from general practitioners offices and MVs were contacted immediately. After the final assessment, partici -\npants were invited to a post-intervention interview to assess in -\ntervention acceptability, which was conducted via telephone or face to face. Although this interview contained both quantitative and qualitative elements, this study solely focuses on quantitative data. Study participants were offered an incentive of up to 100 EUR, of which 30 EUR were disbursed after the baseline assess -\nment, and the remaining 70 EUR after the post-intervention in -\nterview. \nParticipantsThe computer-based screening was completed by 2,773 HCPs, \namong whom 55 (2.0%) fulfilled the final in- and exclusion criteria (cf. Fig.\u00a01 and online suppl. Table 1; for all online suppl. material, see www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000499040). As binge drinking initially was not considered as an inclusion criterion, 8 (14.5%) of these HCPs were not detected as eligible for study inclusion. An-other 6 (10.9%) were assigned to project 2. The remaining 41 HCPs (75.5%) were offered to participate in our study. Of the 27 (65.9%) HCPs who consented to participate, 3 (11.1%) withdrew their con-sent before baseline and 5 (18.5%) were not reachable as they did not provide sufficient contact information or did not react to con-tact attempts. The remaining 19 (70.4%) HCPs completed the baseline assessment. The media advertisements led to 40 registered contact attempts by MVs (cf. Fig.\u00a0 1). The initial screening was completed by 31 MVs of whom 15 (48.4%) were eligible for study inclusion, consented to participate, and completed the baseline \n \nassessment. \nAll 34 baseline completers were invited to participate in the \npost-intervention interview (participation rate 94.1%; 17 HCPs, 15 MVs; n = 31 via telephone, n = 1 face to face [HCP]). The overall \nattrition of those who completed the baseline assessment and thus started the intervention was 11.8%. Attrition was restricted to HCPs (n = 4, 21.1%). The final sample for our pre-post analyses consisted of the 30 participants (15 HCPs, 15 MVs) who provided data at the 6-month follow-up.\nInterventionThe intervention was a computer-based, fully automatized ex-\npert system [14] based on the transtheoretical model of behavior change [21]. Utilizing data gathered in CATIs, it generated indi-vidually tailored motivational feedback letters for participants. Af-ter baseline, T1, and T2, participants received 2 feedback letters, respectively. In addition, they received weekly individually tai-lored short messages via mobile phone or E-mail (online suppl. Fig.\u00a01). Online supplementary Table 2 summarizes the basic inter-vention characteristics.Krause et al.

Table 3). For the alcohol module, we relied \non an already existing system that has been found to reduce alco -\nhol use among HCPs [12]. The depression module was developed for this project. Based on the work of Levesque et al. \n[13], it in -\ntended to address depressive symptoms by motivating individu -\nals to implement evidence-based depression preventive or ame -\nliorating behaviors (DPBs) into their daily routine. The 5 target behaviors were (1) obviate negative thoughts \n[22, 23], (2) engage \nin healthy, pleasant activities on most days [24, 25], (3) practice stress management on most days [26\u201328], (4) exercise on most days [29\u201331], and (5) getting help (professional or nonprofes -\nsional) when needed. A detailed description of the intervention including example letters in German is provided in the supple -\nment.\nMeasuresAlcohol Consumption\nTo assess drinking behavior and to detect a moderate or severe \nAUD, we used the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test \n (AUDIT,\n \n[32]). It consists of 10 items asking for consumption patterns and experienced negative consequences of alcohol consumption. Each item can be scored from 0 to 4 with a maximum AUDIT sum score of 40. A moderate or severe AUD was assumed if the score was 20 or higher [33]. In that case, screening participants were excluded from the study and given an envelope containing contact information of institutions providing specialized care for individuals with drinking problems. The 6-month follow-up assessment included the 3 con -\nsumption items of the AUDIT (AUDIT-C, [34]) only.\nTo determine average intake of pure alcohol in grams per day, \nthe categorical AUDIT-C items were complemented by a con -\ntinuous assessment of alcohol consumption. Thus, we specifical-\nly asked how often participants drank alcohol and how many \nstandard \nunits of alcohol they typically drank at one occasion (on -\nline suppl. Table 4). Average daily intake of pure alcohol was de -\ntermined by calculating a quantity-frequency index assuming 10.5 g of pure alcohol for one standard drink. To determine binge drinking, a gendered version of the AUDIT item 3 considering thresholds defined in the respective inclusion criterion were used [35]\n. \nDepressive SymptomsDepressive symptoms were assessed with the 8-item version of \nthe Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8, [18]). At the initial screening, prior to the presentation of the PHQ-8, participants an-swered 3 screening items from the depression section of the Mu-nich Composite International Diagnostic Interview [36], which were adopted to the 12 months prior to the screening: \u201cIn the past 12 months, have you had a period of 2 weeks or longer where you \u2026\u201d (a) \u201cfelt sad, despondent or depressed almost daily for most of the time?\u201d, (b) \u201cfelt constantly tired, drawn or exhausted, even when you had not been doing hard work or have been physically ill?\u201d, (c) \u201clost interest in most things? This means, for example, hobbies, leisure, and being together with friends, that is things you usually enjoy?\u201d If at least one of these items was endorsed, the PHQ-8 was presented.\nIf participants reported that depressive symptoms were present \nwithin the past 2 weeks and the PHQ-8 sum score of their most severe episode within the past 12 months was 20 or higher, they were excluded as we had to suspect a current severe depressive episode. In that case, participants were given an envelope contain-ing contact information of institutions providing specialized care for individuals suffering from depressive symptoms. \nBaseline PHQ referred to the 2 weeks within the past 12 months \nin which the participant felt worst. At follow-up, PHQ referred to the 2 weeks within the past 6 months in which the participant felt worst. A PHQ sum score \u226510 was considered clinically relevant [18]. In addition to assessing more recent depressive symptoms with the PHQ-8, lifetime diagnosis of depression (major depres-sion or dysthymia) and count of lifetime DSM-IV criteria for ma-jor depression were assessed using the depression section of the Munich Composite International Diagnostic Interview, which was included in the 6-month follow-up assessment.\nMotivation to Change Drinking Behavior and Usage of Depression Preventive BehaviorsMotivation to change drinking behavior and usage of DPBs \nwere assessed on the basis of staging algorithms ([13, 37], online suppl. Fig.\u00a02). DPB usage was assessed for each DPB separately. Participants were classified as precontemplators, contemplators, preparators, or actors [21]. Per definition, precontemplators do not perform the target behavior and do not intend to do so anytime soon. Contemplators do not perform the target behavior but in-tend to do so in the foreseeable future. Preparators intend to begin performing the target behavior within the near future (usually the next month), and actors already perform the target behavior. \nAcceptabilityParticipants\u2019 evaluations of the intervention and intervention \nusage were chosen as main indicators for intervention acceptabil-ity. Using 5-point Likert scales, participants rated the information given in both intervention modules in terms of how helpful, com-prehensible, individualized, motivating, well formatted, interest-ing, and important they found them. Participants were further asked to grade the intervention modules and the entire interven-tion on 6-point Likert scales ranging from \u201c1, very good\u201d to \u201c6, very bad\u201d. Using 5-point Likert scales ranging from \u201c1, not at all\u201d to \u201c5, absolutely\u201d participants were also asked whether participating in the study was worthwhile for them and whether they would rec-ommend the intervention to other people. \nParticipants\u2019 reading behavior was chosen as indicator for in-\ntervention usage. Participants were asked (1) how thorough they read the letters (I read them completely/partly/I did not read them), (2) whether there were some letters they did not read at all (yes/no; only asked if [1] was answered with \u201cpartly\u201d), (3) whether they read some letters multiple times (yes/no), (4) whether they kept the feedback letters (yes/no), and (5) whether they read the short messages (yes/partly/no). \nStatistical Analysis\nAll calculations were carried out using the Stata 14 statistical \nsoftware package [38]. To test for differences between HCPs and MVs, t tests for independent samples (interval data) and chi-\nsquare tests (categorical data) were used. If expected cell counts were below 5, Fisher\u2019s exact test was applied instead of the chi-square test. To test for pre-post differences, t  tests for dependent \nsamples (interval data) and the McNemar test for dependent samples (categorical data) were used. Due to the explorative na -\nture of our analyses, \u03b1 -levels were not adjusted for multiple com -\nparisons.Krause et al. Eur Addict Res 2019;25:119\u2013131124\nDOI: 10.1159/000499040Results\nSociodemographics\nThe mean age was 35.4 (SD 13.9; Table 1) years. The \nmajority of participants was female, single, employed, and had more than 10 years of school. Age (p = 0.025) and employment status (p = 0.022) were significantly related to recruitment strategy.\nMotivation to Change Drinking BehaviorAt baseline, 3 participants (10.0%) reported that they \nhad already reduced their alcohol intake within the past 6 months (online suppl. Table 5). At follow-up, the num-ber increased to 14 participants. Among those, 71.4% were MVs, which in general tended to show a higher mo-tivation to change their drinking behavior. At baseline, but not at the 6-month follow-up, motivation to change drinking behavior was related to the recruitment strategy (p = 0.002 and p = 0.110, respectively [Fisher\u2019s exact test]). \nAlcohol Consumption\nAt baseline, the mean AUDIT score was significantly \nhigher in MVs than in HCPs (p  < 0.001; Table 2). MVs \nshowed significantly higher levels of daily alcohol intake than HCPs (p  = 0.021), there were significantly more MVs \nthan HCPs who drank more than 12/24 g of pure alcohol per day (p  < 0.001), and MVs reported significantly more \ndrinking days per month than HCPs (p  < 0.001). When excluding MVs with an AUDIT score of \u226520 (n  = 4) from \nthese analyses, that is, applying the same inclusion criteri -\non for both groups, the differences remained (AUDIT: HCPs: M 7.1, SD 3.7; MVs: M 13.7, SD 4.2; \np < 0.001; aver -\nage daily consumption: HCPs: M 8.3, SD 7.5; MVs: M 21.5, SD 3.3; \np = 0.001; participants drinking more than 12/24 g/\nday: HCPs: n  = 1, 6.7%; MVs: n  = 8, 72.7%; p  = 0.001 [Fish -\ner\u2019s exact test]; drinking days per month: HCPs: M 8.1, SD 7.6; MVs: M 17.1, SD 7.6; \np = 0.006). All participants except \none MV participant reported to binge at least once a month. Differences between subgroups were not significant (all participants: p = 1.000; AUDIT<\n 20 only: HCPs: n  = 15, \n100%; MVs: n  = 10, 90.9%; p  = 0.423 [Fisher\u2019s exact test]). \nAt follow-up, MVs showed significant declines in average daily consumption (p  = 0.034), participants drinking more \nthan 12/24 g of pure alcohol per day (p  = 0.002), and drink -\ning days per month (p  \n < 0.001), leading to HCPs and MVs \nno longer differing on these variables (p  = 0.877, p  = 1.000, \nand p = 0.733, respectively). When excluding MVs with an \ninitial AUDIT score of \u226520 from these analyses, differenc -\nes remained insignificant (average daily consumption: HCPs: M 8.7, SD 7.6; MVs: M 6.7, SD 3.6; \np = 0.424; par -\nticipants drinking more than 12/24 g/day: HCPs: n  = 1,  \n6.7%; MVs: n  = 1, 9.1%; p  = 1.000 [Fisher\u2019s exact test]; \ndrinking days per month: HCPs: M 7.8, SD 6.9; MVs: M 7.5, SD 3.6; p  = 0.881). Percentage of participants practic -\ning binge drinking at least once a month was reduced in both subsamples (HCPs: \np = 0.016, MVs: p  = 0.031). Again, Table 1.

On average, MVs fulfilled significantly more DSM-IV criteria for major depression during their lifetime than HCPs (p  = 0.006). At baseline, \nmost participants (86.7%) reported to have experienced clinically relevant depressive symptoms during their most severe episode within the past 12 months. Mean PHQ-8 score tended to be higher in MVs than in HCPs, but the dif -\nference was not significant (p  = 0.079). After the interven -\ntion, most participants (total sample: 86.7%; HCPs: 80.0%; MVs: 93.3%) reported to have experienced depressive\n \nsymptoms at least once within the past 6 months. In the to -\ntal sample, the number of participants with clinically rele -\nvant depressive symptoms during their most severe depres-\nsive episode was significantly lower after 6 months (p  = 0.007), with a significant reduction only seen in MVs (HCPs:\n \np = 0.289, MVs: p  = 0.016). Mean PHQ-8 scores showed that \nboth groups experienced significantly less severe depressive \nsymptoms during the intervention period compared to the preceding 12 months (HCPs: p  = 0.020, MVs: p  < 0.001). \nReductions in depressiveness from pre to post assessment corresponded to medium to large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s d ; \ntotal sample: d  = 0.88; HCPs: d  = 0.68; MVs: d  = 1.10).\nUsage of Depression Preventive BehaviorsAt baseline, all participants reported using at least one \nDPB. In the total sample, the mean number of DPBs used was 2.7 (SD 1.2). HCPs and MVs did not significantly dif-fer in that regard (HCPs: M 2.6, SD 1.2; MVs: M 2.8, SD 1.3; p = 0.658). At follow-up, 29 (96.7%) participants re-\nported using at least one DPB.

Thus, more extensive changes in consumption patterns of HCPs might have occurred after the completion of the study. In terms of depression, data from standardized diagnos-tic interviews showed that MVs compared to HCPs ex-perienced a higher symptom load during their lifetime. In accordance with this result, MVs tended to report more severe depressive symptoms than HCPs at base-line. However, differences did not reach statistical sig-nificance, which might be a consequence of our small sample size and the resulting low statistical power of our analyses. At follow-up, depressiveness was significantly reduced in both subsamples. Additionally, we observed significant increases in the number of DPBs used. These results give support to the idea that we can successfully confront depressive symptoms by fostering the use of DPBs with motivation-based programs [13]. \nGood intervention acceptability was shown by the pre-\ndominantly positive ratings the intervention received from both subsamples. However, acceptability was higher in MVs than in HCPs. Compared to HCPs, MVs rated the alcohol module more positive and busied themselves more with the intervention materials. Furthermore, attri-tion was restricted to HCPs. Differences in baseline mo-tivation to change alcohol consumption might explain these findings. Higher motivation to change has been shown to be related to more positive attitudes toward cer-tain elements of behavioral interventions [40]. Further-more, previous studies have shown that motivation is re-lated to treatment involvement and retention [41\u201343]. \nWith 11.8% in the total sample, attrition across follow-\nups in this study was low, underlining good intervention acceptability. High attrition often is a major limitation of E-health interventions [44]. Computer-based treatmentsfor alcohol and depression have been shown to be affectedby this phenomenon as well [45, 46]. We deem the low at -\ntrition in this study mainly a consequence of our proactiveassessment approach (i.e., actively reaching out to partici -\npants via phone when the next assessment was due). Thiscan be seen as an administrative support type for whichRichards and Richardson \n[46] have shown positive influ -\nences on attrition. This study provides strong evidence forthe benefits of making proactive assessments a fixed com -\nponent of behavioral interventions. However, utilizing pro -Table 5.

While \nthis can be handled well by research staff under experimen -\ntal conditions, implementing such approaches under rou -\ntine care conditions has been shown to be challenging [47]. \nUtilizing different recruitment strategies led to sub-\nstantially different samples in terms of problem severity, motivation to change, pre-post intervention changes, and attitudes toward the intervention. These findings ques-tion a claim made by the ORBIT model [15] according to which it is sufficient to rely on a convenience sample in-stead of a representative one when conducting prelimi-nary tests of interventions. Our data suggest that such an approach might lead to biased conclusions about the po-tential of interventions. This could lead (1) to the dismiss-al of promising intervention approaches or (2) to carrying forward intervention approaches that fail to fulfill the needs for the intended target population. To avoid this, intervention developers should preliminary test their in-terventions on those individuals who are to be targeted by the final intervention. \nIn terms of feasibility, we showed that the intervention \nwas technically and logistically feasible. However, feasibil -\nity under routine care conditions is limited due to the ef -\nforts needed to identify eligible HCPs. Given that only 2.0% of the screened HCPs were eligible for study inclu -\nsion, it seems reasonable to rely on large-scale media ad -\nvertisements to attract intervention participants. Howev -\ner, reach of reactive approaches is low (e.g., [48]) and often limited to specific groups \n[49, 50]. This reduces the public \nhealth impact of interventions. In addition, those that are reached are not always those in need [10]. The cost\u2013ben -\nefit ratio of performing systematic proactive screenings in routine care might be improved if the screenings were ex -\npanded to multiple health risk factors for which comput -\ner-based interventions are provided in case of positive screening results \n[51]. Evidence for the adequacy of such \nan approach is provided by studies showing that the vast majority of the adult population is having at least one health risk factor [52, 53] and by studies showing that these can effectively be addressed with intervention ap -\nproaches like the one described in this study [54]. \nThere are limitations of our study. First, the data ana-\nlyzed solely relied on self-reports, thus being prone to a social desirability bias. Second, this study focused on the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in differ-ently recruited subsamples. Due to the lack of a control group, it does not allow for conclusions concerning inter-vention effectiveness. Third, our evaluation of interven-tion acceptability did not consider qualitative data from the post-intervention interviews. This might have led to biased conclusions on intervention acceptability. Fourth, as this was a feasibility study, the sample size was small. Thus, the generalizability of the results to large popula-tions is limited. Fifth, due to different institutional frame-work conditions on the recruitment sites, we were not able to realize completely standardized recruitment ap-proaches across the sites. Thus, we cannot draw definitive conclusions on the reach of the intervention.\nIn summary, this study has shown that our multiple-\ncontact computer-based intervention targeting both al-cohol use and depressiveness was technically and logisti-cally feasible and acceptable to proactively and reactively recruited samples. As shown by partially substantial pre-post differences, the intervention may have the potential to reduce hazardous alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms. The differences between subsamples showed the importance of addressing the target population of a behavioral intervention when preliminary testing it. To justify efforts for systematic screening, more comprehen-sive patterns of multiple health risks have to be addressed in addition to the specific and relatively rare combination of health risks addressed in the present study. Overall, the results of this pilot study justified the testing of a refined intervention within a randomized controlled trial.

The nature of this\nrelationship remains unclear. Rumination, which is well known to be associated with depression, might act as acommon underlying factor explaining the frequent co-occurrence of both conditions. The aim of this study is toanalyze associations between the rumination subfactors brooding and re \ufb02ection and SPG. Methods: Participants aged\n14\u201364 years were recruited within an epidemiological study on pathological gambling in Germany. Cross-sectional\ndata of 506 (80.4% male) individuals with a history of gambling problems were analyzed. The assessment included astandardized clinical interview. To examine the effects of rumination across different levels of problem gamblingseverity, sequential quantile regression was used to analyze the association between the rumination subfactors andSPG. Results: Brooding ( p=.005) was positively associated with the severity of problem gambling after adjusting for\nre\ufb02ection, depressive symptoms, and sociodemographic variables. Along the distribution of problem gambling\nseverity, \ufb01ndings hold for all but the lowest severity level. Re \ufb02ection ( p=.347) was not associated with the severity\nof problem gambling at the median. Along the distribution of problem gambling severity, there was an inverseassociation at only one quantile. Discussion and conclusions: Brooding might be important in the development and\nmaintenance of problem gambling. With its relations to depression and problem gambling, it might be crucial when itcomes to explaining the high comorbidity rates between SPG and depression. The role of re \ufb02ection in SPG remains\ninconclusive.\nKeywords: rumination, pathological gambling, depression, brooding, re \ufb02ection\nINTRODUCTION\nIt has been shown that symptoms of pathological gambling\n(SPG) and symptoms of depression often co-occur ( Kessler\net al., 2008 ;Petry, Stinson, & Grant, 2005 ;Rizeanu, 2013 ).\nHowever, the nature of this relationship remains unclear. Onepossible explanation for the high comorbidity is that SPG and\nsymptoms of depression pose risk-factors for one another. As\nfor the question of which one is preceding which, there havebeen con \ufb02icting results ( A\ufb01\ufb01, Nicholson, Martins, & Sareen,\n2016 ;Kessler et al., 2008 ). Analyzing data from a longitudi-\nnal study on the relationship between gambling problems anddepression in a sample of young adults aged 18 \u201320,\nChinneck, Mackinnon, and Stewart ( 2016 ) concluded that\nthe frequent co-occurrence of gambling problems and de-\npressive disorders is not due to one of them being a risk-factorfor the other, but due to an underlying factor that bothdisorders have in common. People \u2019sr e s p o n s es t y l e s\n(Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991 ) might be such a factor.\nAccording to Response Style Theory ( Nolen-Hoeksema,\n1991 ), the way people react to depressed mood states is animportant factor when it comes to the severity and duration\nof such states. While engaging in distracting activities helpsto reduce and to shorten depressive symptoms, rumination,\nthat is to think about possible causes and implications of\none\u2019s mood, leads to an ampli \ufb01cation and continuation of\nsuch symptoms. Treynor, Gonzalez, and Nolen-Hoeksema(2003 )l a t e rr e \ufb01ned the concept of rumination. They found\nthat rumination consists of two distinct factors, which differ-entially relate to depressive symptoms. They named thesefactors brooding and re \ufb02ection. Brooding thereby re \ufb02ects \u201ca\npassive comparison of one \u2019s current situation with some\nunachieved standard \u201d(Treynor et al., 2003 , p. 256). Re \ufb02ec-\ntion on the other hand re \ufb02ects \u201ca purposeful turning\ninward to engage in cognitive problem solving to alleviateone\u2019s depressive symptoms \u201d(Treynor et al., 2003 ,p .2 5 6 ) .\n* Corresponding author: Kristian Krause, Dipl.-Psych.; Institute of\nSocial Medicine and Prevention, University Medicine Greifswald,Walther-Rathenau-Str. 48, Greifswald D-17475, Germany; Phone:+49 3834 867 722; Fax: +49 3834 867 701; E-mail: kristian.\nkrause@uni \u2011greifswald.de\nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License ,\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium for non-commercial purposes, provided the original author and\nsource are credited, a link to the CC License is provided, and changes \u2013if any \u2013are indicated.\nISSN 2062-5871 \u00a9 2018 The Author(s)FULL-LENGTH REPORT Journal of Behavioral Addictions 7(2), pp. 384 \u2013391 (2018)\nDOI: 10.1556/2006.7.2018.38\nFirst published online May 30, 2018While both factors correlate with current depression, only\nbrooding correlates with depression over time, which led\nTreynor et al. ( 2003 ) to the assumption that re \ufb02ection might\nbe adaptive in reducing depressive symptoms over time bycausing effective problem solving.\nIt has been shown that rumination is not only related to\ndepression but to several mal adaptive behaviors as well,\nincluding binge drinking, alcohol abuse, bingeeating, and self-harm ( Nolen-Hoeksema, Wisco, &\nLyubomirsky, 2008 ). There is evidence that rumination,\nespecially its subfactor brooding, might be related togambling as well. Using the Problem-Focused Styles ofCoping Inventory (PF-SOC; Heppner, Cook, Wright, &\nJohnson, 1995 ), Getty, Watson, and Frisch ( 2000 )a s s e s s e d\nthe coping styles of pathological gamblers of the Gamblers\nAnonymous (GA) and compared them with the coping\nstyles of non-pathological gambling matched controls.They found that pathological gamblers reported higherlevels of reactive (ruminative) coping and lower levels ofre\ufb02ective coping. Most importantly, the differences in\nreactive coping could not be explained by depressive\nsymptoms. While the PF-SOC does not directly assess\nrumination in the sense of the Response Style Theory(Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991 ), the results hint at the importance\nof rumination, especially brooding, in SPG, as the reactiveand re \ufb02ective coping styles measured with the PF-SOC\nshow resemblance with the brooding and re \ufb02ection sub-\nfactors of rumination ( Getty et al., 2000 ).\nGambling has long been thought of as a means to\nalleviate depressive symptoms ( McCormick, Russo,\nRamirez, & Taber, 1984 ), a notion supported by several\nstudies (e.g., Dickerson, Baron, Hong, & Cottrell, 1996 ;\nGrif\ufb01ths, 1995 ). The results by Getty et al. ( 2000 ) suggest\nthat there is a direct link between gambling and rumination,\nespecially its subfactor brooding, as well. The aim of this\nstudy is to analyze the relationship between rumination andgambling problems among subjects representing a broadrange of severity levels of problem gambling. In light of theaforementioned results, we expect that ruminative brooding(RB) but not ruminative re \ufb02ection (RR) is related to SPG,\nindependent from depression.\nMETHODS\nSample\nData were obtained from an epidemiological study on\npathological gambling [Path ological Gambling and Epi-\ndemiology (PAGE); Meyer et al., 2015 ]i nG e r m a n y .\nProactive and reactive recruitment strategies were used toreach a suf \ufb01cient number of participants representing\ndifferent levels of gambling problems. Participants were\ndrawn from the general population and from populations\nwith a high risk of gambling problems, i.e., gamblinglocation visitors, people undergoing treatment for patho-logical gambling, or volunteers responding to mediaannouncements (for further details, see Meyer et al.,\n2015 ). Participants from the gen eral population, gambling\nlocation visitors, and people undergoing treatment for\npathological gambling were pro actively recruited as studypersonnel actively reached out to them in their respective\nsettings. The remaining particip ants, e.g., those responding\nto media announcements, were classi \ufb01ed as being reac-\ntively recruited. Data were acquired in a two-step proce-dure. First, gambling behavior and criteria for pathologicalgambling were assessed in a diagnostic interview mostlyadministered through telephone. People reporting gam-bling problems (ful \ufb01lling one or more DSM-IV criteria\nfor pathological gambling) we re then invited to participate\nin an in-depth clinical interv iew conducted face-to-face.\nAdditional data were collected using paper \u2013pencil ques-\ntionnaires. Gambling locatio n visitors were offered an\nincentive of up to 20 \u20acfor their participation in the initial\ndiagnostic interview. For p articipation in the in-depth\nclinical interview, all partic ipants were offered an incen-\ntive of 100 \u20ac(c.f. Meyer et al., 2015 ).\nMeasures\nSymptoms of pathological gambling. SPG were assessed\nusing the gambling section of the World Mental HealthComposite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)\nversion 3.0 ( World Health Organization, 2009 ). In general,\nthe CIDI gambling section was administered in a comput-er-assisted telephone interview. For participants who wererecruited in inpatient facilities, it was included in theclinical interview, which was held as a computer-assistedpersonal interview at the inpatient facility. Problemgambling severity was operationalized by the number of\nDSM-IV criteria for pathological gambling. Participants\nwere classi \ufb01ed as at-risk (1 to 2 DSM-IV criteria), problem\n(3 to 4 DSM-IV criteria), or pathological gamblers (5 ormore DSM-IV criteria).\nRuminative brooding and re \ufb02ection. Rumination includ-\ning its subfactors brooding and re \ufb02ection was assessed\nusing the German version of the 10-item Rumination\nResponse Scale ( Treynor et al., 2003 ;G e r m a nv e r s i o n\nRSQ10-D, Huffziger & K\u00fchner, 2012 ). Each subscale is\nassessed with \ufb01ve items, which are answered on a Likert\nscale ranging from 1 \u2013almost never to 4 \u2013almost ever.\nBoth subscale scores thus range from 4 to 20. Huffzigerand K\u00fchner ( 2012 ) reported acceptable internal consis-\ntencies (Cronbach \u2019s\u03b1)o f \u03b1=.60\u2013.75 for the brooding\nsubscale and \u03b1\n=.56\u2013.75 for the re \ufb02ection subscale. For\nour sample, we found acceptable to good internal consis-tencies of \u03b1=.80 for the brooding subscale and \u03b1=.73\nfor the re \ufb02ection subscale. The RSQ-10D was adminis-\ntered as a paper \u2013pencil questionnaire.\nDepressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were\nassessed using the depression section of the Munich Com-posite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI;Wittchen et al., 1995 ), a German language version of the\nWHO CIDI. The M-CIDI depression section was adminis-tered face-to-face. To determine severity levels of depres-sion, a count of DSM-IV major depression symptoms\n(range: 0 \u20139) was calculated.\nStatistical analysis\nAll calculations were carried out using the Stata 14\nstatistical software package ( StataCorp, 2015 ). Means\nJournal of Behavioral Addictions 7(2), pp. 384 \u2013391 (2018) |385Gambling, depression, and the role of ruminationwere calculated for RB, RR, and the number of depressive\nsymptoms for participants classi \ufb01ed as at-risk, problem,\nand pathological gamblers. Mean differences between\nthese groups were tested using one-way analyses ofvariance with subsequent Bonferroni adjusted post-hocpairwise comparisons. To ana lyze the relationship be-\ntween SPG (dependent variable) and both ruminationsubfactors (independent variables), we ran quantileregressions (QRs) using Stata \u2019sqreg procedure. QR\nallows to model the conditional median or any other\nquantile, whereas ordinary least squares (OLS) regressionprovides estimates of conditional means ( Koenker, 2005 ).\nThe estimation of QR coef \ufb01cients is based on minimizing\nthe absolute residuals rather than the sum of the squaredresiduals as in ordinary regression. QR was preferred over\nOLS regression because of the multimodal and left-\nskewed distribution of SPG as the dependent measure inour sample. This is in contrast to the right-skewed distri-bution in the general population and a consequence of thesampling design including additional recruitment chan-nels with an increased prevalence of individuals with\nsevere gambling problems. While normality is a critical\nassumption in OLS, QR allows to adequately analyzesuch skewed and non-normal data. Another advantage ofQR is that it allows us to explore associations along thewhole distribution of the dependent variable by running aseries of separate QRs for different quantiles ( Cameron &\nTrivedi, 2009 ).\nIn this study, we \ufb01rst analyzed the association of SPG\nwith the rumination subfactors and each of the othercovariates using univariate m edian regression analysis.\nThen, a multivariate median regression was computedwith depression severity ( number of DSM-IV symptoms),\nsociodemographics (age, sex, education level, marital\nstatus, and migration background), and recruitment strat-\negy (proactive vs. reactive) included as covariates besidesboth rumination subfactors. Finally, the multivariate QRwas repeated with quantiles re presenting the number of\nSPG in our sample. To determine those quantiles, wecalculated the cumulative percentages of participantsreporting the respective number of symptoms. This quan-\ntile selection allows us to speci \ufb01cally analyze the rele-\nvance of the independent variables at any severity levelrepresented by the dependent variable. For each quantile, aseparate multivariate QR was conducted. Finally, theestimates of the QR coef \ufb01cients for ruminative brooding\nand re \ufb02ection from those analyses were plotted with 95%\ncon\ufb01dence intervals to visualiz e the variability across\ndifferent levels of problem gambling severity.\nEthics\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review\nBoard of the University of Greifswald. All participantswere informed that their participation was voluntary and\nthat consent could be withdrawn at any time. Oral consent\nto participate and to store contact data was obtained duringthe telephone interviews. An informed consent form wassigned by all participants during the clinical interview andby parents of minors.RESULTS\nDescription of the sample\nParticipant \ufb02ow and sociodemographic characteristics. Our\nanalysis is based on a data set consisting of data from506 individuals. Table 1provides an overview on the\nsociodemographic characteristics of the sample and the\nnumber of participants recruited via proactive and reactiverecruitment strategies. Figure 1shows the participant \ufb02ow.\nA total number of n=15,775 participants completed the\ninitial diagnostic interview. Among them, 95.23% had beenrecruited by the general population sample contacted\nthrough landline or mobile phone, 1.92% from gambling\nlocations, 1.77% from treatment facilities for pathologicalgambling, and 1.07% through media announcements. Of then=15,775 individuals, 1,796 (11.39%) reported at least one\nSPG and were therefore eligible for the in-depth clinicalinterview. Of those eligible, 1,188 (66.15%) individualsconsented to participate in the in-depth clinical interview.\nFor logistic reasons, the interviews were restricted to\n594 (50%) of those individuals. After exclusion of partici-pants with incomplete data, 506 (85.2%) participantsremained in the \ufb01nal analysis sample. For further details\non the selection process, see Meyer et al. ( 2015 ).\nSymptoms of pathological gambling and depression.\nParticipants reported a mean of 6.74 ( SD=2.96) SPG. The\nmajority of the sample ( n=375, 74.11%) has to be classi-\n\ufb01ed as pathological gamblers (5 \u201310 SPG), followed by\nat-risk (1 \u20132 SPG; n=70, 13.83%) and problem gamblers\n(3\u20134 SPG; n=61, 12.06%; c.f. Table 2).\nDepressive symptoms were reported by 352 (69.57%)\nparticipants. Percentage of individuals with at least one\ndepressive symptom is highest among pathological gam-\nblers (73.33%, n=275), followed by problem (59.02%,\nn=36) and at-risk gamblers (58.57%, n=41).

In the univariate\nmedian regression analyses, RB but not RR was signi \ufb01cant-\nly associated with SPG. The association was positive,meaning that at the median, an increase in RB was associ-ated with an increase in the severity of gambling problems.The absolute number of depressive symptoms, low educa-tion level, being unmarried, male sex, and being reactivelyrecruited also showed signi \ufb01cant positive associations with\nSPG at the median. Being employed showed a signi \ufb01cant\nnegative association with SPG, meaning that at the median,being employed was associated with less SPG. Age andhaving a migration background showed no signi \ufb01cant asso-\nciations with SPG at the median (c.f. Table 3).\nMultivariate median regression analysis. In the multi-\nvariate median regression, RB remained signi \ufb01cantly asso-\nciated with SPG when controlling for RR, depressivesymptoms, employment status, education, marital status,age, sex, and recruitment strategy. The association waspositive, meaning that an increase in RB was associatedwith an increase in the severity of gambling problems. Thedata revealed no signi \ufb01cant association of RR with SPG at\nthe median. As in the univariate median regression, the\nabsolute number of depressive symptoms remained signi \ufb01-\ncantly positively associated with SPG after controlling forthe remaining variables (c.f. Table 3).\nQuantile regression with quantiles related to number of\nsymptoms of pathological gambling\nTable 4provides detailed results of the QR analyses with\nquantiles related to the number of SPG. When controllingfor RR, depressive symptoms, sociodemographic variables,and recruitment strategy, RB was signi \ufb01cantly associatedwith SPG at all quantiles except the lowest quantile related\nto one SPG. The association was positive for all of these\nquantiles, meaning that an increase in RB was associated\nwith an increase in the severity of gambling problems atalmost every severity level of problem gambling. At thequantile related to one SPG, the association was also posi-tive but failed to reach statistical signi \ufb01cance ( p=.079).\nFor RR, there was a statistically signi \ufb01cant association\nwith SPG only at the quantile related to six SPG when\nincluding RB, depressive symptoms, sociodemographic\nvariables, and recruitment strategy into the model. Thisassociation was negative, meaning that an increase in RRis associated with a decrease in the severity of gamblingproblems at this quantile (c.f. Figure 2).\nWhen controlling for RB, RR, sociodemographic vari-\nables, and recruitment strategy, the absolute number of\ndepressive symptoms was signi \ufb01cantly associated with SPG\nat the quantiles related to four and seven or more SPG. All ofthe signi \ufb01cant associations were positive. At lower levels of\nproblem gambling severity, no signi \ufb01cant associations be-\ntween the absolute number of depressive symptoms and\nSPG were found when controlling for covariates.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study aimed at analyzing the relationship between the\nrumination subfactors brooding and re \ufb02ection and SPG. The\nmain \ufb01ndings of this analysis are that (a) RB and SPG are\nassociated and that (b) especially at subclinical levels ofgambling problems, RB seems to have a larger impact ongambling behavior than depressive symptoms.\nIn our sample, problem and pathological gamblers\nreported signi \ufb01cantly higher RB scores compared to at-risk\ngamblers. Univariate median regression analysis showed asigni\ufb01cant association between RB and SPG that, in a\nmultivariate model, could not be fully explained by depres-sive symptoms or other covariates. When looking at quan-tiles related to the number of SPG, RB was independently\npositively associated with SPG at all but the lowest severity\nlevel of problem gambling. Our \ufb01ndings suggest that RB\nTable 3 .

( 2000 ), who found\nthat compared to non-pathological gamblers, pathological\ngamblers had higher levels of an emotion-focused reactivecoping style even after symptoms of depression were con-trolled for. While RB, in our sample, was associated withSPG at all but the lowest level of problem gamblingseverity, depressive symptoms were associated to SPG\nmainly at the more severe levels. This indicates that RB\nmight be particularly important in the development ofgambling problems, and at least for individuals with a hightendency to brood, that depression seems to be rather aconsequence than a cause of an increasingly problematicgambling behavior.\nThe results concerning the association of RR and SPG\nare inconclusive. Mean RR scores in our sample were higher\nin individuals with more pronounced gambling problems,with single comparisons showing signi \ufb01cantly higher levels\nof RR in pathological compared to at-risk gamblers.

However, this\npart of our analysis was explorative as we did not adjust formultiple testing. Hence, these \ufb01ndings may be rather seen as\nan indication of no substantial independent association ofSPG and RR, which would support the results reported byGetty et al. ( 2000 ). In conclusion, available data rather\nsuggests that RR is of no special interest in SPG, but more\nresearch is needed to further clarify its role.\nSeveral limitations have to be considered for this analysis\n(c.f.Meyer et al., 2015 ). First, the association between RB\nand SPG found in this analysis could be better explained byother factors that were not taken into account in our analysis.\nSecond, as the data collection primarily relied on self-reports,\na reporting bias cannot be ruled out. Third, a substantial partof the subjects who were called in the telephone surveyrefused to participate, probably leading to a selection bias inthe general population sample. Fourth, we did not realize arandom sample of gambling location attenders and inpatients,\nand the reactively recruited participants were per se self-\nselected. Thus, although our analyses were statistically con-trolled for recruitment strategy, generalization of \ufb01ndings to\nthe population level might not be valid. Finally, causalinterpretation of the associations found in this study isprecluded by the cross-sectional nature of our data.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study revealed that RB is associated with SPG and thatit might be particularly important in the development ofgambling problems. Furthermore, with its relations to de-pression as well as to gambling behavior, RB seems to be acrucial factor when it comes to explaining the high comor-\nbidity between depressive disorders and gambling disorders\n(Kessler et al., 2008 ;Petry et al., 2005 ;Rizeanu, 2013 ).\nDiagnoses and treatment of ruminative tendencies should bean inherent part in the treatment of gambling problems.Depressive rumination should further be considered in theprevention of gambling disorders. However, future researchbased on longitudinal data is necessary to gain more insights\ninto the underlying causal mechanisms connecting gambling\nproblems, rumination, and depression.\nFunding sources: Data collection was funded by the 16\nGerman federal states as part of the Pathological Gamblingand Epidemiology (PAGE) program.

Graphical representation of the staging algorithms used to assess participants motivational stage to change their drinking \nbehavior  (left) and to use each of the depression preventive behaviors (right).   \nS14 S15 \n \nDescription of the combined expert system intervention  \n \nThe intervention was a computer -based, fully automatized expert system [1]  that generated \nindividually tailored motivational feedback letters for participants based on data gat hered in \ncomputer -assisted telephone interviews. The software platform of the  intervention was \nMicrosoft Access (Microsoft Office 2010). Supplementary t able 1 provides an overview on the \nbasic intervention characteristics.  \nThe intervention consisted of an alcohol and a depression module, both based on the \ntranstheoretical model of behavior change [2] . For the alcohol module , we rel ied on an already \nexisting system that has been found to reduce alcohol use among health care patients  [90]. \nMinor modifications have been done to the system for the  combined intervention. The \ndepression module was newly developed. It was based on the  work of Levesque et al. [3]  who \naddressed depressive symptoms by motivating individual s to implement evidence -based \ndepression preventive or ameliorating behaviors (DPBs) into their daily routine. We adopted \nthis approach but made adjustments concerning the scope of the intervention. Instead of creating \na lengthy workbook, we used external links to websites to provide additional information. The \nprimary aim of the intervention was to trigger self -help behavior with a minimal intervention \nformat. Thus, comprehensibility and simplicity were leading principles in choosing and \ndefining DPBs. The  five target behaviors chosen were largely congruent to Levesque et al.: 1) \nobviate negative thoughts [91,92] , 2) engage in healthy, ple asant activities on most days \n[93,94] , 3) practice stress management on most days [95- 97], 4) exercise on most days [98-\n100], and 5) getting help (professional or non- professional) when needed. The main differences \nto Levesque et al. concerned behaviors 1 and 5. Cognitive restructuring was not made a topic \nof the current  intervention. We deemed it too complex for an unguided intervention not \nproviding extensive auxiliary material, for example, a workbook in which this st rategy could \nbe thoroughly explained. Instead, we aimed at motivating individuals to apply positive \npsychology exercises (e.g., the three good things exercise [101] ) and to engage in individually \nmeaningful activities (e.g., hobbies or rewarding social behaviors) despite the presence of \nnegative thoughts. We further used a broader definition of help- seeking. In the current  \nintervention, help- seeking also included seeking help from non- professional sources (e.g., \nfriends and family). Moreover, we wanted to motivate participants to seek help not only for \nmental health problems but also for other hassles of daily l iving (e.g., financial) that unresolved \nmight facilitate the development of mental health problems.  S16 \n \nThe alcohol module contained feedback on 1) motivation to change drinking behavior, 2) \ncurrent drinking behavior, 3) personal risk of experiencing (health related, psychological, \nsocial) negative consequences of consuming alcohol, 4) experienced pros and c ons of \nconsuming alcohol (alcohol related decisional balance), 5) processes of change, and 6) self -\nefficacy to resist drinking alcohol in highly tempting situations. The depression module \ncontained feedback on 1) experienced depressive symptoms, 2) partici pants\u2019 motivation to use \neach DPB, 3) outcome expectations concerning DPBs, 4) processes of change, and 5) \nparticipants\u2019 self -efficacy to use DPBs. Outcome expectations were chosen over perceived pros \nand cons of using DPBs because it allow ed giving strate gy specific feedback with less time \nconsuming assessments. Participants preparing to reduce their alcohol intake or to adopt a DPB \nfurther received tips on how to plan the behavior change.  \nAfter baseline, the first ( T1), and second follow -up assessment ( T2), participants received two \nhighly individualized feedback letters  each (cf. Supplementary figure 1). These were created \nbased on a total of 2902 text modules ( baseline: n = 727, T1: n = 1095, T2: n = 1080) , which \nwere combined by applying predefined rules . The interval between letters was 7 days. Feedback \nwas split to avoid that participants had to read and process too much information at once. Letters \nwere divided into two parts. Part 1 focused on depression and DPBs, part 2 on alcohol \nconsumption. Both modules were linked by information about the interrelation of depression \nand alcohol consumption. Supplementary t able 2 provides an overview on the different sections \nof the letters and the variables they wer e tailored by. Letters contained written and visual \nfeedback elements. Their length ranged from three to five pages. Beside the letters, participants \nreceived weekly individually tailored short messages via mobile phone or e -mail. These \nincluded one welcom ing and one farewell message, 15 messages on DPBs (three for each DPB), \nand nine messages on processes of change (six alcohol -related, three depression -related). The \npool of short messages contained 872 messages. Letters and short messages contained severa l \nnormative feedback elements. At T1 and T2, they also provided feedback on whether and what \nindividual changes have occurred.  S17 \n \nReferences to the supplementary materials  \n \n1.
