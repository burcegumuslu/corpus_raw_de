An ethyl acetate extract from aerial parts of Artemisia argyi showed promising activity and was submitted to HPLC-based activity profiling to track the active compounds. From the most active time window, three guaianolides (1, 2, and 5) and two seco-tanapartholides (3 and 4) were identified and, in a less active time window, five new sesquiterpene lactones (8\u201311, 17), along with six known sesquiterpene lactones and two known flavonoids. The absolute configurations of compounds 1, 2, 5\u201310, 13\u201315, 17, and 18 were established by comparison of experimental with calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. For seco-tanapartholides B (3) and A (4), ECD yielded ambiguous results, and their absolute configurations were determined by comparing experimental and calculated vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra.
