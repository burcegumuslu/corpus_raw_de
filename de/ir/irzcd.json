Despite well-documented responses of cortisol (C) and testosterone (T) to strength and endurance exercises, the scarce of data regarding the monitoring of T/C still exist in the intermittent sport games\n[[1]](#ref1), [[2]](#ref2). We aimed to describe the course of T/C in high-level male athletes throughout basketball season.\nMaterial/Methods: This study was conducted on six male basketball players during consecutive 37 weeks. The duration of practices was accounted in minutes, subdivided in categories and expressed as weekly load\n[[3]](#ref3). Involved athletes were recruited for the Euroleague matches as well for Lithuanian and Baltic championships matches. To study the hormonal fluctuations during the basketball season, blood samples were carried out 11 times. First blood sample was taken before the first practice after off-season and represents reference value. Second and third sampling occurred during pre-season preparation. To avoid any confounding effects of variations in circadian rhythm and food intake on hormonal secretion, athletes provided blood samples at same time (09.00\u201309.30) after overnight fasting. All the venous blood samples were drawn via antecubital venipuncture in semirecumbent position. Serum T and serum C concentrations were assayed using Immulite 2000 analyser and immunoassay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerfield, IL, USA).\nResults: The individual dynamic of both measured hormones are highly varying through the period of observation. The individual coefficients of variation are in range between 0.16 and 0.26 for T/C. Also the number of cases when the change of T/C was above the personal coefficient of variation differs among investigated athletes. The Figure 1\n[[Fig. 1]](/static/en/meetings/esm2011/11esm089.shtml_996222145.shtml) represents accumulated data of T/C during 37 weeks of observation. The decreasing of T/C values occurs after beginning of regular practices and remains relatively stable with exception of the last measure through the period of observation. The elevation of last measured T/C was statistically significant and associated with 5-day taper before beginning of play-offs. The Friedman test was used for one-way repeated T/C measures analysis. Significance was set at p<0.05 a priori.\nConclusion: Our results showed that T/C balance through the in-season remains stable suppressed and probably reflect the cumulative impact of regular training rather than effects of the last load. The 5-day tapering is sufficient to elevate T/C ratio in male basketball players.\n[\nReferences\n] [1.]\n- Kraemer WJ, Ratamess NA.
