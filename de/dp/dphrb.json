The claims are false: both international and indigenous health experts said there was no scientific basis for the purported medicine as effective Covid-19 cure and they warn the public against falling prey to such fraudulent claims.\nThe Facebook post published on May 9, 2021\n[here](https://perma.cc/74H5-BBBT) claims an indigenous medicine practitioner in Sri Lanka has discovered a medication to cure Covid-19.\nThe post\u2019s Sinhala language caption translates to English as:\n\u201cAngampora weda medura' (translation: Angampora Treatment Center') located in Katuwana has announced that a medicine that can cure the Corona pneumonia by 95% has been discovered. Upon the announcement, a large crowd has been gathering to get this medication.\n[Angampora](https://lakpura.com/pages/angampora) is a technique of Sri Lankan martial arts that combines combat techniques, self defense, sports, exercise, meditation taught alongside indigenous medical practices as well. [Katuwana](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Katuwana/@6.2647719,80.6824584,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3ae156eeb5ee4053:0x5a5866207ef35e25!8m2!3d6.2636238!4d80.6909448) is a village located in Southern Sri Lanka.\nThe same claims and images have also been shared on Facebook such as seen\n[here](https://perma.cc/XYH2-QJ6F) and [here](https://perma.cc/ZQ3X-UBUX).\nThe claims and images circulated after a Facebook account named Angampora Weda Gedara, which has since been deactivated, shared the same images and claimed they had discovered an indigenous medication with the ability to cure Covid-19 induced pneumonia with some 95 percent efficiency.\nBelow are screenshots of Angampora Weda Gedara\u2019s claims on Facebook taken by AFP on May 10, 2021 before the account was deactivated:\nThe lengthy captions of the misleading posts translate to English in part as: \u201cThe drug that can save from Covid Pneumonia up to 95% is being made at the Angampora Weda gedara these days...Order soon... Those who bring the necessary herbs will not be charged.\u201d\nHis posts also claimed the pneumonia will be cured through the administration of a porridge made out of plants with a high oxygen concentration.\nThese claims surfaced while Sri Lanka battles a surge in the Covid-19 infections in a third wave of the pandemic. As of\n[May 17, 2021](https://hpb.health.gov.lk/covid19-dashboard/) Sri Lanka has recorded 142,746 infections, with more than 100 deaths during the past week alone.\nThe claims, however, have been dismissed as false by medical experts who told AFP there was no scientific basis behind those claims.\nSri Lanka Health Promotion Bureau Registrar\n[Dr. Ashan Pathirana](https://www.facebook.com/hpbsrilanka/) told AFP the public should not fall prey to fraudulent \u2018cures\u2019.\n\u201cThere is no scientific basis behind these claims. Believing in them will only cause grave repercussions. For example, a Covid-19 positive patient resorting to a false cure instead of seeking immediate medical care if the condition takes a turn for the worse can end up in a fatality,\u201d Dr. Pathirana said.\n[Dr. L. P.A. Karunathilake](https://iim.cmb.ac.lk/academic-staff-shalya-shalakya/), a senior lecturer of Indegenous medicine at the [University of Colombo](https://cmb.ac.lk/ ) told AFP the purported \u2018cure\u2019 is fraudulent.\n\u201cIndigenous medicine and ayurveda treatments follow methods that have been codified since over a thousand years ago. No individual can claim any such discovery. Moreover, to proclaim the efficacy of any medication, necessary clinical trials have to be followed. In this case there is no scientific data to back the claims,\u201d Dr. Karunathilake told AFP.\nAFP also contacted a traditional Angampora practitioner Samantha Gunarathna to verify the authenticity of an angampora medication being able to cure Covid-19 pneumonia.\nSpeaking to AFP on May 10, 2021 he said the claim is a falsehood because although their treatment manuals provide instructions on administering liquid oxygen via herbal treatments, it is not viable at present due to a lack of necessary herbs.\n\u201cSome of the herbs are endemic to India and they are unavailable locally. As a result, the manufacturing process of certain medications has been halted for a long time now,\u201d he told AFP.\nThis is not the first of false cures for Covid-19 circulating online in Sri Lanka. AFP has debunked several claims including\n[a \u2018miracle syrup\u2019 by a faith healer](/sri-lankan-faith-healer-touts-false-miracle-cure-covid-19-prompting-pushback-doctors) and a [falsely touted supplement](/sri-lankan-faith-healer-touts-false-miracle-cure-covid-19-prompting-pushback-doctors).
