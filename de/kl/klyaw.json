When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Verizon Communications Inc. (\n[NYSE:VZ](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/telecom/nyse-vz/verizon-communications?blueprint=2682926&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=intro&utm_source=yahoo)) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n[ Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/telecom/nyse-vz/verizon-communications?blueprint=2682926&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=cta&utm_source=yahoo)\nHow Much Debt Does Verizon Communications Carry?\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2023 Verizon Communications had debt of US$157.3b, up from US$151.2b in one year. However, it does have US$4.92b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$152.4b.\nA Look At Verizon Communications' Liabilities\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Verizon Communications had liabilities of US$51.4b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$232.0b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$4.92b and US$23.7b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$254.8b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\nThe deficiency here weighs heavily on the US$139.9b company itself, as if a child were struggling under the weight of an enormous back-pack full of books, his sports gear, and a trumpet. So we definitely think shareholders need to watch this one closely. At the end of the day, Verizon Communications would probably need a major re-capitalization if its creditors were to demand repayment.\nIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\nWith net debt to EBITDA of 3.2 Verizon Communications has a fairly noticeable amount of debt. On the plus side, its EBIT was 7.2 times its interest expense, and its net debt to EBITDA, was quite high, at 3.2. Sadly, Verizon Communications's EBIT actually dropped 7.7% in the last year. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Verizon Communications's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward.

So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the last three years, Verizon Communications recorded negative free cash flow, in total. Debt is usually more expensive, and almost always more risky in the hands of a company with negative free cash flow. Shareholders ought to hope for an improvement.\nOur View\nMulling over Verizon Communications's attempt at staying on top of its total liabilities, we're certainly not enthusiastic. But on the bright side, its interest cover is a good sign, and makes us more optimistic. After considering the datapoints discussed, we think Verizon Communications has too much debt. While some investors love that sort of risky play, it's certainly not our cup of tea. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the\n[ 2 warning signs we've spotted with Verizon Communications](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/telecom/nyse-vz/verizon-communications?blueprint=2682926&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&utm_source=yahoo) .\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.
