Results: On average, 78.3% of the participants felt more integrated and connected, 84.2% perceived themselves as more calm and balanced, and 50% felt vitalized after SCFM sessions, while only 5% or less felt more agitated or depressed after the sessions. SCFM was not significantly different from MM. The positive effect of SCFM correlated positively with mindfulness self-ratings.
