Because of the clinical relevance, the development of a vaccine against HCMV has gained top priority in biomedical research. The immunogenicity of non-infectious subviral particles, so called Dense Bodies (DBs), renders them a promising basis for vaccine development. DBs are released in large amounts in vitro from infected primary fibroblasts (HFF) and can easily be purified from HFF culture supernatants by gradient centrifugation. Vaccine production in primary cell cultures like HFF is, however, associated with several restrictions. Permanent cell lines established by transfection of the transforming functions of DNA tumor viruses provide an attractive, alternative cell substrate for vaccine manufacturing. The lines that had been tested for this purpose thus far have, however, been notoriously resistant to HCMV replication and progeny production. The main goal of this work was to test the CAP cell line for its suitability to replicate HCMV and to release infectious virus as well as DBs. CAP cells were provided by Cevec Pharmaceuticals GmbH. They had been immortalized by the adenovirus type 5 early proteins E1A and E1B. Initial testing showed that HCMV was able to efficiently penetrate CAP cells and to start its immediate early (IE) gene expression. Infectious virus could indeed be detected in the culture supernatants of CAP cells. This was the first time that productive infection of HCMV could be demonstrated in cells transformed by adenoviral proteins. The infectious titer and the number of DBs were, however, substantially lower compared to what was normally seen in HFF cultures. Subsequent analyses were therefore conceived to address the reasons for this discrepancy. It could be demonstrated that HCMV infection of CAP cells leads to the disruption of ND10 domains. These structures are part of the innate, antiviral response and their dissolution is a prerequisite for the initiation of productive HCMV infection. Viral early and early-late gene expression could be demonstrated in further analyses. This showed that the basic mechanisms of permissive HCMV infection are supported by CAP cells. There were, however, again marked quantitative differences to HFF infection noted. A reflection of the restricted replication of viral genomes and the low-level expression of viral structural proteins was the low number of viral particles that were detectable in late-stage infected CAP cells by electron microscopy. Further analyses indicated that differences in cell-cycle control between CAP cells and HFF were at least in part responsible for the low productivity of the former. The cell cycle stimulation mediated by adenoviral E1-proteins was identified as being putatively inhibitory to HCMV replication in CAP cells. It could be demonstrated that CAP cells were preferentially cycling through S-phase at the time of HCMV infection. The S-phase is, however, restrictive to immediate-early gene expression of HCMV, thus preventing high level viral replication. These results showed that adenoviral E1-proteins expressed in CAP cells do not block HCMV infection. Yet their influence on the host cell at various levels is likely restrictive to HCMV replication. Targeted intervention with E1A/E1B functions may provide an attractive strategy to support HCMV replication in CAP cells. This work has provided valuable knowledge for the adaptation of HCMV on CAP cells and for the optimization of DBs-production in these cultures.\n610 Medical sciences\n[https://ror.org/023b0x485](https://ror.org/023b0x485) [http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-4551](http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-4551) [urn:nbn:de:hebis:77-diss-1000003756](https://nbn-resolving.org/urn/resolver.pl?urn=nbn:de:hebis:77-diss-1000003756) [https://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/](https://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/) [JGU-Publikationen](/handle/20.500.12030/2)\nFiles in This Item:\n|File||Description||Size||Format|", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["#content", "https://ub.uni-mainz.de", "#", "/mydspace", "/profile", "#", "/advanced-search", "/community-list", "/browse?type=author", "/browse?type=title", "/browse?type=dateissued", "/browse?type=dateavailable", "/browse?type=subject", "/browse?type=type", "/browse?type=department", "#", "https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/4553?locale=en", "https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/4553?locale=de", "#", "/help-faq", "/help-research", "/help-faq-search", "/help-publish", "https://www.ub.uni-mainz.de/de/dissertationen", "/contact", "/", "/handle/20.500.12030/1", "/handle/20.500.12030/2", "/browse?type=author&value=Kr%C3%B6mmelbein%2C+Natascha", "https://ror.org/023b0x485", "http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-4551", "https://nbn-resolving.org/urn/resolver.pl?urn=nbn:de:hebis:77-diss-1000003756", "https://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/", "/handle/20.500.12030/2", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/4553/1/100000375.pdf", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/4553/1/100000375.pdf", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/4553/1/100000375.pdf", "/handle/20.500.12030/4553?mode=full", "/handle/20.500.12030/4553/statistics", "/imprint", "/privacy", "/contact", "/guidelines", "https://doi.org/10.18452/24678", "https://www.uni-mainz.de/"]}
