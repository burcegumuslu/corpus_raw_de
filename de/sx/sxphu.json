Author and leading economist Richard Koo explains the unique political and economic pitfalls that stand in the way of recovery from this rare type of recession that was largely overlooked by economists. Koo anticipated the current predicament in the West long before others and issued warnings in his previous books: Balance Sheet Recession and The Holy Grail of Macroeconomics. This new book illustrates how history is repeating itself in Europe while the United States, which learnt from the Japanese experience, is doing better by avoiding the fiscal cliff. However, because of the liberal dosage of quantitative easing already implemented, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan may face a treacherous path to normalcy in what Koo calls the QE Trap. He argues that it is necessary to understand balance sheet recession in order to resolve the Eurozone crisis, particularly the competitiveness problems. Koo issues warnings against those who are too ready to argue for structural reforms when the problems are actually with balance sheets. He re-examines Japan's two decades of experiences with this rare recession and offers an insider view on the Abenomics. On China, readers will gain a very different historical perspective as Koo argues that western commentators have forgotten their own history when they talk about the re-balancing of the Chinese economy.\n* Learn from Japan which experienced the same predicament afflicting the West fifteen years earlier\n* Discover how unwinding of quantitative easing will affect the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, as well as the emerging world\n* Examine solutions to the Eurozone problems caused by two balance sheet recessions eight years apart\n* Gain insight into China's problems from the West's own experiences with urbanisation\nKoo, who developed the concept of balance sheet recession based on Japan's experience, took the revolution in macroeconomics started by John Maynard Keynes in 1936 to a new height.

This book presents his latest thinking in a clear and powerful way. Agree or disagree his work deserves close study if the next decade in the industrial world is going to be better than the last.\"\n- Lawrence Summers, President Emeritus and Charles W. Eliot University Professor, Harvard University; former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury\n\"This is an important, stimulating, exciting and timely book. Guided by the ideas in this book, growing numbers of experts are appreciating the parallels between the current world-wide crisis and the crisis Japan experienced 15 years ago. The basic insight - that in the presence of persistent liabilities, the private sector minimizes debt - is one that needs to be fully appreciated in order for appropriate policies to be devised. This is a must-read for all those seeking to respond to the current economic malaise.\"\n- Dennis J. Snower, President, Kiel Institute for the World Economy; Professor of Economics, Christian-Alberchts University, Kiel\n\"Koo's The Escape from Balance Sheet Recession and the QE Trap provides the most insightful guide to current macroeconomic policy available today. Koo's concept of 'balance sheet recession' adds depth and detail to observations of the 'liquidity trap' and 'zero lower bound' of interest rates. He explains what needs to be done now and how long it could take. Everyone concerned with macroeconomic policy needs to read this analysis to learn how the world economy can be revived.\"\n- Peter Temin, Elisha Gray II Professor Emeritus of Economics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\"I have always liked the Richard Koo style - succinct theories, razor-sharp points, self-sustaining logic, and, more importantly, a set of workable solutions. It's definitely a worthy read.\"\n- Gao Xiqing, Professor, School of Law, Tsinghua University; former Vice Chairman and President, China Investment Corporation.\n\"In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, governments and financial institutions have instituted a wide range of changes in such areas as risk management, regulation, market organization, and fiscal and monetary policy. Unfortunately, however, these measures have suffered from a lack of a unified recognition of the fundamental problem. In a clear, engaging and penetrating way, Richard Koo has diagnosed the core nature of the challenge and the appropriate response. The Escape from Balance Sheet Recession and the QE Trap is an essential guide for anyone interested in the future of the global economy.\"\n- Jeffrey E. Garten, Juan Trippe professor of international trade and finance and former Dean, Yale School of Management; former Undersecretary of Commerce\n\"When the history of this depression is written, policymakers who ignore Koo's finding will be judged harshly for imposing unnecessary suffering on their societies.\"\n- Richard Duncan, Author, The Dollar Crisis", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["#main", "https://www.wiley-vch.de/de/fachgebiete/finanzen-wirtschaft-recht/volkswirtschaftslehre-13ec/makrooekonomie-13ec1/the-escape-from-balance-sheet-recession-and-the-qe-trap-978-1-119-02812-3", "/en/areas-interest/finance-economics-law/economics-13ec/macroeconomics-13ec1/the-escape-from-balance-sheet-recession-and-the-qe-trap-978-1-119-02812-3", null, "/", "/de/", "#", "/de/shop/neuerscheinungen", "/de/fachgebiete", "/de/shop/bookfinder", "/de/shop/journals", "/de/shop/ebooks", "https://www.wiley-vch.de/de/shop/cart", "/de/shop/zusatzmaterial-vergriffener-titel", "#", "/de/fachgebiete/computer-und-informatik", "/de/fachgebiete/finanzen-wirtschaft-recht", "/de/fachgebiete/geistes-und-sozialwissenschaften", "/de/fachgebiete/hobby-und-freizeit", "/de/fachgebiete/hotelfach-und-gastronomie", "/de/fachgebiete/ingenieurwesen", "/de/fachgebiete/kunst-und-kultur", "/de/fachgebiete/mathematik-und-statistik", "/de/fachgebiete/medizin-und-gesundheit", "/de/fachgebiete/naturwissenschaften", "#", "/de/service/publizierende", "/de/service/bibliotheken", "/de/service/buchhandel", "/de/service/presse", "/de/service/anzeigen", "/de/service/industrie-und-firmen", "/de/service/dozierende", "/de/service/lizenzen-rechte", "/de/service/privatpersonen", "#", "/de/ueber-wiley/verlag-u-seine-geschichte", "/de/ueber-wiley/kontakt", "/de/ueber-wiley/wiley-weltweit", "/de/ueber-wiley/impressum", "/de/ueber-wiley/agb-widerrufsbelehrung", "/de/ueber-wiley/gesellschaften-und-partnerschaften", "/de/karriere", "http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/24/11190281/1119028124-45.pdf", "/de/ueber-wiley/agb-widerrufsbelehrung#versandkosten", "#product-description", "#product-tab1-content", "#product-tab2-content", "/de/info/worlwide", "/de/info/gesellschaften-und-partner", "/de/ueber-wiley/agb-widerrufsbelehrung", "/de/ueber-wiley/impressum", "/de/newsletter/wiley-vch-alerting-service", "https://www.facebook.com/WileyVCHVerlag", "https://twitter.com/WileyVCH", "https://www.youtube.com/user/Passion4Publishing", "https://de.pinterest.com/wileyvch/", "/de/social/social-media", "/de/ueber-wiley/impressum#datenschutz", "#", "http://www.wiley.com/go/copyright", "http://www.wiley.com", "http://2glux.com/projects/jumi"]}
