The description focuses on rhetoric and aesthetic processes of plausibility gaining within the field of alternative medicines. An Ayurveda centre and ayurvedic tea packages serve as examples to analyse main attractors and the process of establishing \u2018new\u2019 medical knowledge: harmony, flexibil-ity and the holistic approach taking into account the individuality of a person, her cosmological em-beddedness and her psychosomatic unity have the most impact on the rise of Ayurveda and similar healing movements. The outcome of this article is a double one: a methodology of plausibility pro-cesses and the specific attractors of Ayurveda. Both of them are the background for medical ethics, its discursive societal context and the court in which medical ethics have to proof they are \u2018plausible\u2019. https://www.zfme.de/index.php/text.html?param=3&ausgabeid=28&contentid=348\nLoading Preview\nSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
