Within the fieldof tension between happiness (eudemonia) and liberty (autonomy) he sounds out the feasibility ofleading a successful life. For happiness and morality, which are contradictory at first sight, can complement each other. Leading a happy life can imply living in accordance with morality.\nIs it possible to lead a happy life and still live in accordance with morality? This question already\narises in daily life. At the same time it raises the question of the worldly wisdom of ancient culturesand above all of philosophy. As long as one interprets happiness as well-being in a purely subjectivesense, it will at best accord with morality by coincidence. But if one uses \u201chappiness\u201d to mean thequality of a successful life, i.e., that one\u2019s own existence is successful, then that implies attitudes thatundoubtedly have a moral character and can be termed virtues.\nIn the three major sections of this book Otfried H\u00f6ffe guides the reader through the questions of\nphilosophical ethics. Using lucid and generally understandable language he lays out definitions ofhappiness and freedom. He points out not only the aberrations in the history of philosophy but alsothe difficulties owing to the questions themselves. Does the good take precedence over that which iscorrect, or is it the other way around? Does freedom always mean anarchy, and is it conceivable thatfreedom could be increased through morality? Is morality just a nicer word for stupidity? Do peoplehave a good or a bad character? Does evil exist?\nAlthough Otfried H\u00f6ffe\u2019s philosophically enlightening thoughts offer a fundamental orientation, they\nare not a set of instructions. But then, a person who leads an autonomous life would also refuse totolerate instructions of any kind.\nOtfried H\u00f6ffe is professor of philosophy and director of the Research Center for Political Philosophy at\nthe University of T\u00fcbingen.

A long article on intellectualintegrity attempts to shed light on this posture from various historical and systematic perspectives.Religion, which enjoyed only a marginal existence alongside mysticism in his previous book, nowalso comes to the fore. Tugendhat\u2019s theory holds that religion is a fundamental human need but thatit founders on the question of intellectual integrity.\nAccording to the proposition put forward in this book, whatever \u201cmetaphysics\u201d may entail it can be\nreduced to anthropology because all metaphysical topics turn out to be elements of human under-standing. Following that, Ernst Tugendhat arrives at yet another explanation for the primacy ofanthropology. Everything historical loses its validity for us if it can be substantiated only through theconcept of tradition. Thus, if everything that belongs only to tradition is pulled aside like a curtain,what remains is the question of mankind\u2019s being.\nBut what is philosophical anthropology and how does it differ from empirical anthropology? Ernst\nTugendhat\u2019s book examines questions such as these and additionally devotes itself to individualanthropological topics such as free will, intellectual integrity, morality, religion and our relationshipto death.\nErnst T ugendhat was born in Br\u00fcnn in 1930 and\ncurrently resides in T\u00fcbingen.

Both of them, the primordial fish and its stalker,have achieved global renown: Hans Fricke as a scientist, filmmaker and author, and the lobe-finnedfish as a \u201cliving fossil\u201d that is an ancient and distant predecessor of mankind.\nEven as a young man, biologist Hans Fricke dreamed of tracking down the enigmatic lobe-finned\nfish and investigating its life under water. With the help of two submersibles, \u201cGeo\u201d and \u201cJago,\u201dwhich he financed from his own resources, his research dream was finally fulfilled. Fricke and hiscrew pursued \u201cQuasti,\u201d as they had meanwhile lovingly nicknamed the fish, down to great depthsand came ever closer to the secret of this dinosaur among sea dwellers. Fricke made the lobe-finnedfish world famous through television films and magazines \u2013 it even appeared on the front page ofthe New York Times. But profiteers and swindlers were also on the trail of the ur-fish. This suspensefully written book recounts one of the last great science adventures of our times.\nHans Fricke was born in 1941. He is an honorary\nprofessor of zoology at the University of Munichand has directed research projects at the MaxPlanck Institute in Seewiesen. Dr. Fricke has authored two books, numerous scientific publications, and articles for \u201cGeo\u201d and \u201cNationalGeographic.\u201d His more than 30 documentary andtelevision films have earned him numerous international prizes and distinctions, among themthe golden \u201cNautilus Award.\u201d\n320 pages, 80 color illustrations, hardcover, EUR 19.90C.H.BECK 5 Natural ScienceG\u00fcnter Brakelmann\nHelmuth James von Moltke\n1907 \u2013 1945\nEine Biographie\nHelmuth James von Moltke\n1907 \u2013 1945.A Biography\nG\u00fcnter Brakelmann has written a vivid description of Helmuth James von Moltke\u2019s unusual journeythrough life. As the founder and mastermind of the Kreisau Circle, von Moltke was one of the mostfascinating figures of the German resistance against Hitler. This book draws on numerous new sources to present a lively picture of von Moltke\u2019s charismatic personality, and it explains histhoughts and actions \u2013 which elude ideological categorization of any kind \u2013 within the context of histimes. Following a long interval, the publication of this comprehensive biography now makes a standard work on Helmuth James von Moltke available once again.\nBorn and raised on the Kriesau estate in Silesia, Helmuth James von Moltke enjoyed a liberal, \nprimarily British upbringing through his mother. Even at an early age the dedicated, prospectivelawyer self-confidently established ties with politicians and intellectuals, openly expressed criticismof Hitler\u2019s rise and finally renounced a career as a judge so that he would not have to join the Naziparty. He was brilliantly successful as an attorney in Berlin and London and equally so as the squireof Kreisau who saved the indebted demesne. The estate was shielded, as it were, by the aura of thePrussian General Field Marshall von Moltke so that after the war began it became a meeting placefor a group of Nazi opponents. Simultaneously von Moltke utilized his assignment a specialist ininternational law at the Wehrmacht high command for subversive activities, which led to his arrestearly in 1944. On January 23, 1945, Helmuth James von Moltke was executed in Berlin\u2019s Pl\u00f6tzenseeprison.\nG\u00fcnter Brakelmann presents a forceful description of the life of this equally pensive and \ncourageously determined resistor. He succeeds masterfully in shedding light on the \u2013 increasinglyreligious \u2013 motives of von Moltke\u2019s thoughts and deeds. In addition, the author\u2019s grand biography isan impressive portrait of the Kreisau Circle.\nG\u00fcnter Brakelmann was born in 1931 and is\nprofessor of Christian social ethics and contemporary history at the University of Bochum.His many publications on the German resistancehave earned him a reputation as a leading authorityon the Kreisau Circle.\n430 pages, 50 illustrations, hardcover, EUR 24.906C.H.BECK BiographyJoseph Croitoru\nHamas\nDer islamische Kampf um Pal\u00e4stina\nHamas\nThe Islamic Struggle for Palestine\nRadical Islam is fighting for Palestine on various fronts: through Hezbollah from without, and from\nwithin the country through Hamas, which took office surprisingly in 2006. Joseph Croitoru haswritten a highly graphic history of Hamas and its jihad against Israel, which is pursued not onlythrough numerous suicide attacks but also a far-reaching charity network. Not least, the author raises the disquieting question of what it means for the West when Islamists reconcile themselveswith democracy.\nOriginally developing as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine, Hamas held\nits ground as a religious alternative to the secular PLO. Along with its terrorism, Hamas feigns pragmatism in the opposition and as the governing party, but its ultimate goal remains to reconquerthe entire territory of historical Palestine and to found an Islamic Palestinian state. As part of thiseffort its social and educational network serves not only charitable purposes but also the ideologicalpreparation of the jihad against Israel. Israel, in turn, views Hamas exclusively as a terrorist organization and retaliates with all severity \u2013 but with limited success. Drawing on numerous sources which had been previously unknown in the West, Joseph Croitoru impressively revealsHamas\u2019s goals and mode of operation. His masterfully written book is a must for anyone who wantsto understand how the Islamists, now enjoying democratic legitimacy, are fundamentally changingthe political coordinates in the Near East.\nJournalist Joseph Croitoru was born in Haifa in\n1960 and holds a doctoral degree in history. He hasbeen living in Germany since 1988 and is a regularcontributor to the \u201cFeuilleton\u201d of Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.

Niklaus Largier develops this theory over the course of 14 chapters which he illustrates with examples from cultural history, literature, art and cinema. Hedraws an arc that reaches from the evocation of seductive images in the legends of medieval saints tothe films of Luis Bu\u00f1uel and the literature of Charles Baudelaire, Joris-Karl Huysmans and GeorgesBataille, from the spiritual exercises of Ignatius von Loyola to the pornographic fantasies of theMarquis de Sade, and from the artistic pleasure of early modern still lifes to the cult of sensual experience in postmodern cuisine.\nThe theme of this book is the cult of exquisite, decadent pleasure, eccentric enjoyment of choice \ndelicacies, intense abandon to the stimulation of artificial paradises, and the preference for sensualdelights. The legendary pleasure derived from a bottle of Chateau d\u2019Yquem with Roquefort. Themood of exquisite melancholy evoked by the \u201cStabat Mater.\u201d A lascivious touch. And above all thelong history of the pleasure of asceticism, which in the judgment of the enlightened Modern Age wascharacterized as \u201coverwrought.\u201d The decadent literati of the late 19th century who took an imaginary, morbidly decaying Rome as their model and read the legends of medieval saints withenthusiasm, were also in agreement that the most delicate pleasures can only be found where theyare accompanied by a rebellion against nature, as in asceticism. Only in the apotheosis of desire dothe ascetic and the sybarite find the ability to conquer the measured pleasures of the bourgeois emotional disposition and the melancholy ennui of modern life through a synthetic paradise.\nNiklaus Largier is professor of German literature\nat the University of California, Berkeley.

But how can order emerge from chance\nand chaos? What do science and philosophy have to say on the subject? In this book Klaus Mainzerintegrates multidisciplinary insights from the fields of mathematics, physics and information technology with evolutionary theory, brain research, economics, and the social and cultural sciences.He shows how we can learn to live with coincidence \u2013 in nature and society.\nWhat role do coincidence and risk, crisis and new chances play in nature and society? The notion of\na deterministic world with a clearly predestinate past, present and future is a fiction. Coincidenceturns out to be the central theme of the modern natural and social sciences.\nMany single coincidental events together can have noncoincidental characteristics. In this manner\nnew orders arise within a sea of random fluctuations. The universe itself serves as an example: generations of stars and galactic structures form within the cosmic stream of entropy. But life, too,arose on the margins of coincidence. Evolution shows how chance mutations of DNA informationand environmental conditions determine the characteristics of organisms.\nKlaus Mainzer describes the role of chance in every conceivable context: in mathematics and \nprobability theory, in roulette and on the stock exchange, in thermodynamics, quantum physics,computers and information theory, brain research, economics and society. This book shows that ourexposure to coincidence is fundamental. We do not live in a world where everything gets better byitself. Nothing will get better unless we are attentive and sensitive to changes.\nKlaus Mainzer is professor of philosophy and the\nphilosophy of science at the University of Augsburg,director of the Institut f\u00fcr Philosophie (Institute forPhilosophy), and director of the Institut f\u00fcr Interdis-ziplin\u00e4re Informatik (Interdisciplinary Institute forInformatics).

Whether it was the Emperor who\nhoped to be crowned in Rome, or the bishop who wanted to receive his crook there, the Pilgrimwho longed to pray before the relics of the apostles, the artist seeking to perfect his skills by studying the ancients, or the erudite who sought to find their own identity in Roman history \u2013 theEternal City drew them all. The force of its attraction was so strong that people from the northernside of the Alps would assume the costs and hardships of weeks and even months of travel in orderto reach the goal of their desires. Today, trains, automobiles and airplanes have reduced the trip toRome to a matter of a few hours. It has become the result of a momentary decision and no longerthe focus of planning one\u2019s life. \u201cWhereas a journey here was once a pilgrimage and surely an eventin a person\u2019s life, nowadays it is dispatched in the shortest of times,\u201d wrote Ferdinand Gregorovius,a 19th century and Rome admirer.\nFor a long time Christian Jostmann dreamed of journeying to Rome on foot, and when the \nopportunity suddenly presented itself he made a few practical arrangements and set out fromMunich carrying the vital necessities on his back, with two months of time and the Alps before him.In this book he recounts his experiences on this journey over timeworn but long forgotten paths toan ancient destination. He tells of companions and predecessors, of great battles and extinct languages, a German military doctor at the Po River and a hobby archaeologist in the Apennines, ofchanting monks and unrecognized prophets, hospitality and solitude, in short, his moving encounters with Italy\u2019s past and present as only a wanderer experiences them.

In addition to poetical homage these rules provided for the production of aportrait of the beloved such as Petrarch had supposedly commissioned of his Laura. The imaginaryLaura was now replaced by young ladies who were real and were painted in equally real portraits.The game was invented by Lorenzo de\u2019Medici and was quickly imitated in Italy\u2019s better society, withnot only the great lords and princes as dedicated players but Cardinals as well. Yet matters didn\u2019talways stop with idealized love, with adoration from afar. The ritual gave rise to genuine feelingsleading to relationships and sensual fulfillment. The gallant game of an elite society in which ideallove was commingled with sensual passion came to an end in the Counter-Reformation which reestablished the insuperable dichotomy of (forbidden) sexuality and its (permissible) practice inmarriage. We are indebted to this ritual for some of the greatest masterworks of the Italian Renaissance \u2013 such as Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s portraits of Ginevra Benci or Cecilia Gallerani \u2013 andsome its most beautiful love stories.\nIngeborg Walter has published extensively on the\ncultural, artistic and social history of the ItalianRenaissance.

He outlines the fundamental changes in European societies since 1945, tracking notonly the significant differences within Europe but also Europe\u2019s commonalities and special socialcharacteristics up to the present.\nIn this social history of Europe Hartmut Kaelble devotes himself to the many volatile topics that are\ncurrently the subject of public discussion. He examines the changes in family structure, the workplace, educational systems, consumer behavior, migration streams and social security systems inthe individual countries, but he also raises questions pertaining to common European values andsocial inequality. Beginning with the postwar era he describes the period of economic expansionduring which mass consumerism established itself, while modern cities and the welfare state alsotook shape.

He has written extensively onhistory and literature. Most recently, C. H. Beckpublished his \u201cDas unaufhebbare Nichtbescheidwis-sen der Mehrheit. Sechs Reden \u00fcber Literatur undKunst\u201d (\u201cThe Irrevocable Ignorance of the Majority.Six Essays on Literature and Art\u201d: 2005).\n112 pages, 4 illustrations, softcover, EUR 12.0014C.H.BECK History of LiteratureEva Kessler\nVon der Kunst, liebevoll zu erziehen\nSinnvoll Grenzen setzen und gute Laune bewahren\nOn the Art of Raising \nChildren with Love\nSetting Meaningful Limits and Staying ina Good Mood\nEva Kessler has become known through her lectures and seminars. At the request of her audienceshe has written down what she considers to be the essentials of contemporary child-rearing. Onlywhen we understand what children experience and the way they feel are we also in a position toensure the right kind of confident and benevolent upbringing.\nContact is as important for children as breathing, eating and sleeping. If it is absent they feel lost\nand become afraid. This condition can take on extremely threatening forms particularly in youngchildren. Many children and adolescents who suffer from a lack of physical, verbal or visual contactattract attention to themselves by overstepping limits.\nPeople who know and recognize these relationships are also able to understand children\u2019s uncons-\ncious behavioral strategies. Many provocative, annoying, conspicuous and conflicted behaviors thenappear in a new light. It now becomes possible not only to understand them but also to exert a positive influence \u2013 by taking a loving approach to childrearing that allows children ample room toexperience the world but likewise provides support and a sense of safety. It is an approach whereone additionally does not hesitate to act decisively and set meaningful, reasoned boundaries, therebyhelping children to orient themselves in the world.\nEva Kessler was born in 1953 and has been in \nprivate practice as a family and child counselor inFlintbek near Kiel since 1993. She additionallyworks in a supervisory capacity for institutions inthe fields of education, social pediatrics, child andadolescent psychiatry, and remedial education. Sheconducts continuing education seminars and lectures on pedagogical topics.\n272 pages, softcover, EUR 16.00C.H.BECK 15 EducationPeter Gruss, editor\nDie Zukunft des Alterns\nDie Antwort der Wissenschaft\nEin Report der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft\nThe Future of Aging\nScience RespondsA Report by the Max Planck Society\nThis book presents readable, generally understandable information on the current status of agingresearch and the relevant biological processes. The authors are internationally recognized scientists,primarily affiliated with the Max Planck Society. Their insights help readers to gain a fundamentalunderstanding of the \u201caging\u201d phenomenon.\nIn affluent nations people are living to ever greater ages. Along with the rise in average lifespan,\nsales of anti-aging products are booming. Indeed, everyone wants to live a long life, but also stayyoung while they do so. Yet it is astonishing how little we know about the background and causesof the aging process. This book addresses the following issues:\n- What is aging? \n- Is the human lifespan limited at all? - What influences cellular aging? - What is the effect of diet, stress or infections on the aging process? - Which pathologies accompany aging, and which prophylactic or therapeutic measures can be \ntaken? \n- What can an aging brain still accomplish? What kinds of work can it perform perhaps even better \nthan a younger brain? \n- How can we craft a new inter-generational contract? - Does life have a specific purpose during old age? \nPeter Gruss , the editor, was born in 1945. He is a biologist and has been president of the Max Planck\nSociety since 2002. Peter Gruss has received numerous prizes and awards for his scientific research including the \u201cNieders\u00e4chsischer Staatspreis\u201d (State Prize of Lower Saxony), the \u201cLeibniz Prize,\u201d the \u201cLouisJeantet Prize for Medicine,\u201d and the \u201cZukunftspreis des Deutschen Bundespr\u00e4sidenten\u201d (German President\u2019s Future Prize).\nContributing authors include:\nProfessor Paul B.

Coincidence, structural strains and the \nactivities of \u201cselfish genes\u201d don\u2019t account for everything. The appearance of the human brain on theevolutionary stage represented a caesura. Ever since then the play and its production have acquireddecisive new dimensions.\nAlthough human evolution rested on a genetic basis, genetics alone do not sufficiently explain it.\nHeredity and the brain each contributed and still contribute in their own thoroughly competitivefashion to the dynamics of the evolutionary process. Even in their chronological dimensions they dif-fer momentously. The contribution of the genome to evolution is measured in thousands to millions ofyears or in hundreds to thousands of generations, the contribution of the brain, however, in minutes,days, years or in a single generation.\nThe human brain is capable of fashioning something entirely different from its interactions with the\nenvironment than genes are able to produce. The majority of what it produces are autonomousaccomplishments for which the genome has no instructions on hand. Internationally renowned evolutionary biologist Wolfgang Wieser outlines a new, revolutionary concept of evolution where thebrain plays a second leading role alongside the \u201cselfish gene,\u201d and where hereditary transmission ofacquired characteristics is also an important factor.\nWolfgang Wieser is professor emeritus of \nzoology at the University of Innsbruck. His book\u201cDie Erfindung der Individualit\u00e4t\u201d (\u201cThe Inventionof Individuality\u201d) earned him the 2005 Anna Kr\u00fcgerPrize of the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin (BerlinInstitute for Advanced Study).\n320 pages, hardcover, EUR 24.90C.H.BECK 17 Natural ScienceRafael Ferber\nWarum hat Platon die \u201eungeschriebene\nLehre\u201d nicht geschrieben?\nWhy Didn\u2019t Plato Write the\u201cUnwritten Doctrines\u201d?\nThe debate over Plato\u2019s \u201cunwritten doctrines\u201d which he communicated only to a small circle of trusted disciples has caused a stir among philosophers in recent decades. Rafael Ferber assumes adifferentiated position in this controversy. He is convinced that the \u201cunwritten doctrines\u201d actuallydid exist but that Plato, for reasons inherent in the process of gaining knowledge, was unable tocommunicate these doctrines even to his closest disciples. In this book Ferber outlines the discussionand summarizes the standpoints of greatest interest.\nEver since Aristotle we have known that Plato did not put his most important teachings into writing,\nbut instead communicated them only orally to the inner circle of his disciples. While the extant dialogues merely pass down Plato\u2019s \u201cexoteric\u201d doctrines, his most important \u201cesoteric\u201d insights werenot meant for the general public. In the meantime, the contents and significance of Plato\u2019s \u201cunwritten doctrines\u201d have become the subject of debate in philosophical circles.\nFifteen years ago, at the height of the controversy over the \u201cunwritten doctrines,\u201d Rafael Ferber\nentered the fray with a small book. He proposed that Plato was also unable to communicate the\u201cunwritten doctrines\u201d because the highest principles (i.e., the subject of the \u201cunwritten doctrines\u201d)cannot be known through logical operations due to an epistemological paradox. Ferber\u2019s differentiated position met with great respect and acceptance, although in individual cases it wasalso rejected.\nFerber\u2019s new book again presents the text of 1991, but significantly expands it through new \nperspectives and an outline of the discussion it triggered. In this book the reader learns what ismeant by Plato\u2019s \u201cunwritten doctrines\u201d and what the controversy is actually all about.\nRafael Ferber is professor of philosophy at the\nUniversity of Lucerne and a titular professor at theUniversity of Zurich.

Werner von Koppenfels traces the European destinies of a vital and adaptable literary genre from its ancient origins to theskepticism of the Enlightenment and the horror visions of the Modern Age. This reader-friendly andattractively illustrated book is an invitation to rediscover both classic and unfamiliar texts.\nAt the beginning stands the legendary Greek anti-philosopher Menippos from the school of the\ncynics, whose subversive fantasy bestowed his name on an often misunderstood genre that hasremained effective from the skepticism of antiquity to the experience of catastrophe in the ModernAge. \u201cMenippean satire\u2019s\u201d outside view exposes the madness of normality, the questionability of alldogma and the insanity of heroism. An equally humorous and drastically orchestrated paradoxycharacterizes all of the often interrelated texts that participate in this European dialogue \u2013 fromLucian to Erasmus, Morus, Rabelais, Swift and Jean Paul all the way to Kafka and science fiction.Werner von Koppenfels recounts this literary history of the slanted view in a generally accessible andriveting style. He opens up new perspectives on an illustrious tradition of freethinking which is anything but uncontemporary.\nFrom the contents: The View from the Top; On the Humor of Ultimate Things; Animal Standpoints;\nUtopian Counter-Worlds; Metropolis as Necropolis; Varieties of Menippean Dialogue.\nWerner von Koppenfels is a retired professor of\nEnglish and comparative literature at the Universityof Munich.

In addition, his rendering of the history of events and politics in Late Antiquitydiffers in many respects from the account presented in the first edition. He begins with the crisis ofthe Roman Empire under the soldier emperors (235 \u2013 284) and recounts developments up to the endof Justinian\u2019s rule (565). He describes the internal conditions of the Empire \u2013 government, society,economy, education, cities, religion \u2013 and sheds light on the interpretations of Late Antiquity overtime. The comprehensive appendix features, among other things, lists of rulers, genealogical tables,overviews of late Roman society and the administration of the empire during Late Antiquity, and adetailed chronological chart. For this completely revised edition the current status of research litera-ture since 1989 was reviewed and, when necessary, analyzed and incorporated; this applies in particular to archaeological research findings.\nUntil his retirement, Alexander Demandt was a\nprofessor at the University of Berlin.

At one time a situation arose in which Rafa hadbeen faced with deciding between Pascal and Per. She had chosen Per but he never learned what really transpired between Rafa and Pascal.\nNow everything comes to the surface again, the tensions of the past are compounded by tensions of\nthe present, such as the offers Pascal makes to Rafa, and Per\u2019s desire for the cool but very enticingInita. Two days in the house will turn everything upside down. A boy who is roaming about in thevicinity will cause a stir, and Inita will disappear \u2026\nThomas Lang\u2019s new, subtly narrated novel is cleverly arranged on two time levels. The author \ncreates a kind of laboratory situation: he endows his characters with the language of people who areinformed and yet delivers them to even greater ignorance. A suspenseful, precise and atmosphericallydense narrative, \u201cAmong Couples\u201d tells of relationships and affairs, of love in the present tense, thepower of the material world and the powerlessness of alienated emotions.

And there is a brighter, baroque,more urbane past that existed before the most recent, tormenting period of German history. In everything that Hans Pleschinski has written to date one senses a desire to reconnect with this pastand arrive at a modern, contemporary tone that extends and conveys the candor, magnanimity, elegance and perhaps even the playful lust for life that is our legacy, whether we choose to believe itor not.\nThe stories and essays in this book, whether they tend toward fiction or autobiography \u2013 which is\nespecially touching \u2013 manifest the very attitude that also marks a generational change. Not least thismeans enchanting and captivating the world, eliciting its beauty and transforming it with beautyeven when the world presents itself as dry and provincial. An apocalyptic negation of the world isalien to Hans Pleschinski. Instead, this knowledgeable and educated author who is full of self-ironyand wit recommends the once aristocratic virtues of comeliness, generosity and cosmopolitanism \u2013and a little less sobriety.\nHans Pleschinski was born in 1956.

Zvi Yavetz, professor emeritus ofancient history at the University of Tel Aviv, describes his childhood and early youth in Czernowitz.Born the son of Jewish parents in 1925, he grew up in an age of upheaval. A lively literary scene andthe coexistence of languages and peoples still shaped daily life in Czernowitz, but the \u201cold world\u201d ofthe Dual Monarchy was drawing to a close. The author makes the long lost world of the 1930s and40s come alive with emotionally charged images. Using the impressive language of \u201cCzernowitz German\u201d he tells how people lived together, but he also notes their differences in a city that producedsuch diverse poets and scholars as Paul Celan, Rose Ausl\u00e4nder, Erwin Chargaff or Josef Schumpeter.What arises before the reader\u2019s eye is the picture of a long lost world and a cultural center thatremains unequaled.\nZvi Yavetz was born in Czernowitz in 1925.

The biblical Psalms, which continue to influence all spiritual poetry to this day,are patterned after ancient Oriental literature. And who could feel more called upon to take up thisvenerable form of religious song and prayer and imbue it with new meaning in a contemporary formthan SAID, whose lyrical language always draws on Persian tradition as well.\nNothing in his psalms is to be taken for granted, not even his relationship to the God he invokes;\neverything is radically open and new. SAID\u2019s psalms leave no one cold, and they leave nothing out,not the catastrophes and conflicts of history, not the language of the present, not the distress of everyday life, not lust or yearning or the fear of death.\nAfter the demise of the great utopias and the universal triumph of the marketplace, people are \nimperiled by world powers and global corporations. More than a few of them yearn for a purposethat transcends consumerism and the physical. Many of them are falling back on conventional traditions and rituals, including those of religion, despite the fact that these are highly contestable. Inhis psalms SAID moves in a religious space that remains open to all of the questions we have in thisrealm, and he omits not a single one of them.\nSAID was born in T eheran in 1947.

His point of departure is the theory that federalism must not be understood solely asthe legal distribution of state and national competencies. Rather, it involves the growing importanceof national minorities and regional awareness, which are occasionally fanned by militant identitypolitics and shift the inner balance of federal states, even within the European Union. But Klaus vonBeyme also compares the economic and social successes of federal states with those of centralizedcountries, and federalism does not always come off well.\nKlaus von Beyme is professor emeritus of \npolitical science at the University of Heidelberg.C.
