The simple plausibility of this model demonstrates that common discussions of decision making and action are constrained within metaphysical frameworks that are at best questionable. The model, in turn, enables a model of free will that is consistent with contemporary physics and likely, from an evolutionary perspective, to have emerged.\nDescription The Phenomenology of Sex, Love, and Intimacy presents a phenomenological exploration of love as it manifests itself through sexual desires and intimate relationships. Setting up a unique dialogue between psychology and philosophy, Susi Ferrarello offers a perspective through which clinicians can inform their practice on diverse issues of human sexuality.\nContinuum Philosophical Dictionaries\n2012 \u2022\nThe majority of Pf\u00e4nder scholars (including Husserl himself) have focused more on Motives and Motivation than on the Phenomenology of Willing: in the former work there is a clear delimitation of the sphere of voluntary acts as opposed to other acts of striving, such as desiring. The question that I ask in this article is both more general and more specific, and is one which scholars have not paid sufficient attention to. I mean the question of whether what makes a striving into a striving\u2014and thus also a willing\u2014is an element that has the nature of a feeling or not. If it is such an element, one might get the idea that strivings are nothing more than an aggregate of a representative experience and a feeling. Emulating Husserlian terminology, we might say that the \"character of striving\" of an experience of striving would then have the nature of a feeling. If, however, that is not how things are, then experiences of striving would be a specific type of experience, different from experiences of representation and feeling. In my view, this is a highly interesting question. The reconstruction of these two positions, defended by Pf\u00e4nder in the Phenomenology of Willing and Introduction to Psychology, respectively, casts light on a difficult question, i.e. that of the relationship between affective intentionality and the intentionality of the will.\nThe Shorter Logical Investigations\n2001 \u2022\nHusserl Studies, 31, pp. 45-64\n2015 \u2022\nHusserl seldom refers to feelings, and when he does, he mainly focuses on their axiological character, which corresponds to a specific kind of value apprehension. This paper aims to discuss the role of feelings in Husserl from a different angle. For this purpose it makes a detour through Husserl\u2019s early account of attention. In a text from 1898 on attention the aspect of interest, which is said to have a basis in feeling, plays an essential role. Although Husserl argues here that every specific interest is dependent on an objectifying act of perception, he at the same time states that every act of perception necessarily has to be accompanied by an interest of some sort. In the latter sense, the genuine motivational force and necessity of this feeling aspect, namely interest, is emphasized. This ambiguity \u2013 or even contradiction \u2013 shall be the point of departure for the following considerations. The paper argues that it is possible to interpret the role of feelings in intentionality in a different way, namely not as an effect of current perception but as a cause of further perceptions. This tendency is first indicated in the text from 1898 and elaborated further in Husserl\u2019s genetic approach in Experience and Judgment. In Experience and Judgment Husserl develops a broader notion of interest, defining it as a general perceptual drive. This general drive (as a general interest in perceiving) \u2013 so the paper will argue \u2013 expresses itself in concrete perception as a specific preference: it discloses or makes manifest what is relevant for an individual subject at a given time.\nIn this chapter, I will focus on Husserl\u2019s ethics and its potential use for psycho- therapy and psychiatry. In particular, I will examine the notion of volitional body in relation to time and society. As I argued in Husserl\u2019s Ethics and Practical Intentionality (2015), Husserl\u2019s phenomenology of ethics is a science grounded in the ontological region of the volitional body, and a praxis experienced in the form of practical intentionality.\nEtudes ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nologiques\n2002 \u2022\nLoading Preview\nSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
