The social behaviour was examined as \nwell as the marching and milking order of three herds with 24, 35 and 39 lactating ewes. \nIn all three herds a marked social ranking could be proven. The social rank was correlated with both the age and \nthe weight of \u00dcie animal. A significant relationship was found in two of the three herds between rank and milk \nyield. As well as this, it was proven that East Friesian dairy sheep have quite a marked marching and milking \norder. Each animal constantly takes on more-or-less the same position in the order. \nThe close bond of this breed with human beings seems to be a result of intensive contact with the animals. No \nreason was found to prevent the East Friesian dairy sheep being kept in groups of around 40 animals. This can be \ndone on condition that the animals have adequate room and access to the resources satisfying their needs. \nKey Words: sheep, social behaviour, marching order, milking order, animal husbandry, intervening \nZusammenfassung \nTitel der Arbeit: Das Sozialverhalten Ostfriesischer Milchschafe in gr\u00f6\u00dferen Gruppen \nOstfriesische Milchschafe gelten teilweise als Einzelg\u00e4nger und Individualisten.

Introduction \nThe East Friesian dairy sheep is a breed which can be found in sixteenth Century \nliterature (UBBEN, 1530). It was always well-known for being very fertile \n(GNAPHEUS, 1553) and for having a particularly high milk yield (CREMNER, 1932; \nSCHWINTZER, 1985). For this reason they have been being kept, since the beginning \nof the 20th Century, not only in the area from which they originate (East Friesian), but \nalso in areas far away from where they were originally bred, above all in the Ruhr \nValley (ZEEB, 1932; SCHWINTZER, 1985). 422 \nGR\u00c4SER-HERRMANN, SAMBRAUS: The social behaviour of East Friesian dairy sheep in larger groups \nIn the first half of the past Century, the number of stock being kept increased greatly. \nThe East Friesian dairy sheep was known as \"the small man's cow\" (ZEEB, 1932). \nAbove all, during and following the two World Wars, during the economy crisis and in \nthe \"Third Reich\", when a distinctive striving for autarky dominated, the ownership of \nthese animals became widespread (KORN et al., 1986). As the milk served a self-\nsufficiency purpose, the number of animals being kept was always very low (ZEEB, \n1932; HERBERG, 1997). \nEast Friesian dairy sheep have an annual milk yield of ca. 600 kg with 5.5 - 6.0 % fat \n(the sheep breeders association, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, 1997). The breed are well-\nknown in three aspects: they are early mature, fertile and fast growing. Furthermore, it \nis known to be good at forming bonds with humans. In contrast to other sheep, it \nseeks contact to human beings and is known to be a loner. This estimation eulminates \nin a statement from SCHWINTZER (1983): \"The dairy sheep is - in contrast to other \nbreeds - not an animal with herding instinets, but rather a loner, which needs and thus \nseeks mankind's caring hand. In its absence, it will suffer. It can easily be kept as an \nindividual animal, not, however in large groups.\" \nThe East Friesian dairy sheep does indeed vary significantly in its behaviour to that of \nthe other breeds. It was, however, never clarifted whether or not this was a result of \nhabituation, that is through the constant contact which they have with human beings. \nThe other possibility is that, that particular reaction of the East Friesian dairy sheep \nhas arisen from the selection of desired characteristics and is thus genetically \nestablished. Modification or mutation, that is the question in this instance. Those \nsupporting the theory that they are lone animals, give no biological reason why \nkeeping them in larger groups is impossible. There are probably ways which makes \nkeeping this breed in larger herds possible (JATSCH, 1985). \nSince the beginning ofthe 80's, in connection with greater ecological awareness, the \nnumber of East Friesian dairy sheep in Germany has risen significantly (VDL, 1988). \nNew to this development, was the fact that larger herds were being kept now, with 40 \nand more individuals. A Situation such as this affects, above all, the social behaviour \nofthe animals. In the following piece of work, the social structure of larger groups of \nEast Friesian dairy sheep shall be analysed. In the examination, the marching and the \nmilking order were taken into consideration. In this respect, it deals with a behavioural \narea which could be influenced by social behaviour. \n2. Animals, Material and Method \nObservation took place on the following three East Friesian dairy sheep farms. All \nthree were full-time farmers . \nA. Sulzhof: This is a farm with herd-book animals, which lies in the Northern \nRhineland h\u00fcls. The farm contains, amongst other animals, 50 ewes which were kept \nin sub-groups (separated depending on the lambing date). For the following \nexamination, a group of 24 lactating animals were studied. The age of these ewes lay \nbetween one and six years. At the start of the period of Observation, the animals had \nalready been being kept together as a closed unit for the past two months. \nThe experimental herd were kept in a deep litter barn. The surface area ofthe pen was 423 Arch. Tierz. 44(2001)4 \n38.5 m2. An automatic drinker, a salt lick, and several feeding racks were installed. \nThe feeding racks allowed all animals to feed at the same time. In the adjoining area of \nthe sheep house there was a milking parlour with 12 milking points. \nFirst of all, pelleted concentrate was fed in the morning, then soaked sugar-beet chips. \nFollowing this, the feeding racks were all filled with lucerne-hay. Occasionally, the \nsheep were additionally given a b\u00fccket of whey. \nAn hour later, the milking began for the first twelve animals. When the gates were \nopened, the animals ran, without being driven, into the milking area. In the milking \nparlour, they received grain, altematively barley, wheat, and oats. Whilst the first \ngroup of twelve animals were being milked, the other twelve were kept shut into a \nseparate part of the pen. After the second group had been milked, the dividing gate \nwas opened so that the animals had access to the whole of the pen again. The evening \nroutine on the farm was similar to that in the morning. No sugar-beet chips was fed in \nthe evening, however. \nObservation of the animals' behaviour took place on the farm from the beginning of \nMarch to the beginning of April 1997. The periods of Observation took place on five \ndays ofthe week and lasted from 0700 - 1130 h and from 1530 - 2000 h. The total \nlength of Observation time was 171 hours. \nB. Reinfelderhof: This farm was located in the swabian mountains. The total number \nof sheep stock was roughly 70 animals, but only the experimental herd of 39 ewes \nwere being milked. At the beginning of the period of Observation, the animals had \nalready been living together as a herd for about a month. The age of these ewes lay \nbetween one and nine years. The trial herd was housed in part of an open stall which \nhad been used in the past for cattle. The pen had a surface area of 107 m2. The animals \nhad straw bedding. During milking, the pen was divided into separate folds. On the \nlong side of the pen there was a feeding trough. It was long enough to allow room for \nall the animals. It was not, however, filled in its whole length with fodder. The fittings \nwithin the animals\" housing were complemented by an automatic drinker. \nWhen the weather allowed it, the sheep were let out at night onto the meadow. Before \nthe morning milking, they were first brought into the cote and fed with grass silage \nand hay. After having driven all the animals into a separate part of the fold, this was \nthen penned off. The milking parlour was located in immediate vicinity to the pen. The \nanimals received concentrate in the milking parlour. \nAfter milking, the animals returned to the empty section ofthe pen and the next group \nentered the milking parlour. When the milking was finished, the fittings sub-dividing \nthe pen were removed. The morning and evening routine was the same. \nThe data were gathered from the beginning of May to mid June 1997 on this farm. \nBecause of the routine on the farm it was not possible to maintain equal periods of \ntime. There was a morning and an evening period of Observation here too. Observation \ntook place on six days of the week. The total length of the period of Observation was \n152 hours. \nC. Naafbachtalsch\u00e4ferei: This farm was located in Bergisches Land. As well as the \nram and lambs there were 36 ewes. The experimental herd enclosed 35 of these female \nsheep with an age of one to six years. The herd had already existed in this way for 424 \nGR\u00c4SER-HERRMANN; SAMBRAUS: The social behaviour of East Friesian dairy sheep in larger groups \nroughly five months. In the morning and the evening prior to milking the animals were \nin a run with 195 m2 surface area. In this run they had access to water, a mineral salt \nlick and three feeding troughs. There was not enough room at the feeding troughs for \nall the sheep at the same time. \nIn the morning and in the evening the animals were lured from the meadow. They ran \nvoluntarily towards the milking parlour. Once all the animals were in the area in front \nof the milking parlour, the entrance was penned off. The sheep were milked in two \ngroups, each of which contained 18 animals. They received concentrate within the \nmilking parlour. When the milking was finished, the whole group received sugar-beet \nout on the paddock. \nThe period of examination on this farm stretched from mid July 1997 until the drying \noff of the animals at the beginning of September. The sheep were observed on every \nday of the examination period for several hours, both in the morning and in the \nevening. The total length of time in which the animals were observed was 111 hours. \nRecording ofthe data: Before the start ofthe Observation, the sheep were marked with \nnumbered, plastic collars. In order to establish the social ranking, all kinds of dominant \nbehaviour were recorded by hand. Results of fights, driving other animals away and \navoiding other animals were used as indicators in establishing the social ranking. \nFurthermore, the marching order from the meadow into the cote and the order in which \nthey entered the milking parlour were recorded. \nEvaluation of the data: With the help of the acquired data, the rank index of each \nanimal was determined. It was calculated using the method developed by \nSAMBRAUS (1975). Aecording to this method, the rank index ofa sheep is acquired \nby dividing the number of animals beneath it by the number of clarified social ranking \nrelationships. The rank index acquired in this way lies between 0.0 and 1.0. \nThe milking order was determined by noting the order in which the sheep entered the \nmilking parlour. All animals entered the milking parlour voluntarily. On the farm at \nSulzhof, data were collected 43 times during milking, at Reinfelderhof 74 times and at \nNaafbachtal Sch\u00e4ferei 82 times. The average milking position of each animal was \ndetermined by adding all positions taken by one animal and dividing it by the number \nof times being milked. \nThe marching order was the order in which the animals arrived in the area in front of \nthe milking parlour, after having walked a certain distance. This order could only be \ndetermined on the two farms with regul\u00e4r outdoor grazing (Sulzhof and \nNaafbachtalsch\u00e4ferei). The marching order must not necessarily correspond to the \nfollowing milking order. After having reached the area in front ofthe milking parlour, \nwhilst waiting, the order could change. \nThe age and the weight ofthe animals as well as the milk yield were recorded on every \nfarm. These values were available on Sulzhof farm, which was a herd-book farm. On \nReinfelderhof farm, the exact age of the sheep was known. Their weight was \nestablished with the aid of an animal weigher. The milk yield could be established by \nmilking by hand on one occasion into a measuring beaker. It was established in the \nsame way on Naafbachtalsch\u00e4ferei farm. A shepherd established the dental age ofthe \nsheep on this farm as well as their weight through estimination. Arch. Tierz. 44(2001)4 425 \nStatistical methods: With the aid of PEARSON's (PRECHT and KRAFT, 1993) \ncorrelation calculations, correlations between all recorded parameters were \ndetermined: \n1 n \nThe correlation co-efficient r was split up into three groups: 0.3 and under; 0.3 to 0.6; \nas well as 0.6 to 0.9 i.e 1.0. Aecording to these three groups for r, weak, medium and \nstrong correlations shall be spoken of. \ncould be established in this way. In a herd of n animals, different rank 3. Results \n3.1 Social behaviour \nDuring the period of Observation, there was an abundance of social clashes with rank \nsignificance in all three herds. Thus, an essential part ofthe social rank relationships \n\u00ab(rc-l) \nT \nrelationships are imaginable. Within the individual herds, a significant amount of them \ncould be determined (Table 1). A certain amount of clashes remained contradictory. \nHere, both individuals involved won clashes in the course of time, none of which, \nhowever, twice as often as the other. The corresponding rank relationships were \ncounted as unresolved. Most ofthe clashes occurred during feeding time, at the drinker \nand at the beginning ofthe rest periods. There was no change in the rank order in any \nofthe three herds during the whole length ofthe Observation period. \nTable 1 \nKnown Rank Indices in the three Herds observed (Gekl\u00e4rte Rangindices in den drei beobachteten Herden) \nFarm \nBetrieb Number of Animals \nAnzahl Tiere \nOi) Number of possible \nRank Relationships \nAnzahl m\u00f6glicher \nRangverh\u00e4ltnisse \nnCn-l) \n2 known \ngekl\u00e4rt contradictory \nwiderspr\u00fcchlich \nSulzhof \nReinfelderhof \nNaafbachtal\u00ad\nsch\u00e4ferei 24 \n39 \n35 276 \n741 \n595 251 \n547 \n466 90.94 \n73.82 \n78.32 24 \n171 \n116 8.69 \n23.08 \n19.50 \nAnimals with a lower social ranking moved much more carefully and with greater \nawarencss than animals with a higher social ranking in all three herds. Usually they \navoided other members of the herd, keeping a distance of 2 m. Often, when close \ncontact had occurred, (e.g. due to a narrowing) the subdominant animals stood still or \nchanged direction. In most cases, the higher ranked animal did not usually even make \na threat. \nWhether or not the subdominant animal avoided others, did however depend on the \nSituation. At the feeding trough, whilst lying down or during herd fleeing, the lower 426 \nGR\u00c4SER-HERRMANN; SAMBRAUS: The social behaviour of East Friesian dairy sheep in larger groups \nrank animals became careless. \nOccasionally, group fights developed, having been triggered off by one fighting pair. \nIn this case, several animals clubbed together against a few or one single member of \nthe herd. On the Sulzhof farm, a clash was observed in which nine sheep were \ninvolved. \nWithin two of the flocks (Sulzhof and Reinfelderhof), herd members were observed \ntaking on an intervening function. They pushed in between opponents and thus ended a \nclash. The \"intervenors\" tended to be animals in the upper third ofthe rank order (n=8) \ncompared to the lower third (n=4). Nine of the intervening animals took up a medium \nrank position. \nIn all three herds, the age played a highly significant role in deciding the social ranking \n(Table 2; p<0.01). The relationship of ranking to weight was similar, though only \nsignificant for the Sulzhof herd (p<0.05). The relationship between social ranking and \nthe milk yield varied. Whereas a medium correlation of high significance could be \nestablished in the Sulzhof herd, there was no significant correlation (p>0.05) for the \nherd at the Reinfelderhof farm. In the third herd, (Naafbachtalsch\u00e4ferei) there was a \nmedium correlation between social ranking and milk yield which was significant \n(pO.05). \nTable 2 \nCorrelation between Social Rank, Age, Weight and Milk Yield in the three Dairy Sheep Herds (Korrelationen \nzwischen sozialem Rang und Alter, Gewicht sowie Milchleistung in den drei Milchschafherden \nFarm \nBestand \nSulzhof \nReinfelderhof \nNaafbachtal\u00ad\nsch\u00e4ferei Rank and Age \nRang und Alter \nr P \n0.6U \n0.584 \n0.479 0.002 \n0.000 \n0.004 Rank and Weight \nRang \nr \n0.436 \n0.785 \n0.583 und Gewicht \nP \n0.033 \n0.000 \n0.000 Rank and Milk Yield \nRang und Milchleistung \nr P \n0.542 \n0.121 \n0.336 0.006 \n0.462 \n0.048 \n3.2 Marching and milking order \nIf the sequence ofthe marching order was arbitrary, then all animals, seen as a whole \nwould have to have a medium position with a high Standard deviation. A medium \nposition means the following for both herds: \nFarm Number of animals theoretical medium position \nin the marching order \nSulzhof 24 (1 + 24) : 2 = 12.5 \nNaafbachtalsch\u00e4ferei 35 (1 + 35) : 2 = 18.0 \nFor most of the animals the medium marching order position varies significantly from \nthe value expected from a coincidental marching sequence. As to be expected, there \nare, however, several animals in each herd which have a medium marching order \nposition corresponding, to a large extent, to the theoretical medium value. However, Arch. Tierz. 44(2001)4 427 \nthe Standard deviation is significantly less than that expected from an arbitrary \nsequence for all animals in all three herds (Tables 3 and 4).This means that all animals, \nmore-or-less faithfully, repeatedly took up the same position in the marching order. \nTable 3 \nAverage Milking and \n(Durchschnittliche Melk \nSheep No. \nSchaf-Nr. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n25 \nmean Standard \nDeviation \nMittlere \nStandardabw.

Discussion \nMost of the situations dealing with social ranking were not fights, rather than that, \nsituations displaying threatening and avoiding behaviour. This is typical for \nestablished rank orders, as it is their very purpose to avoid fighting situations. In only \none ofthe herds, fights repeatedly took place. This was traced back to the high density \nof the herd (1.6 m / animal), which often forced the animals to reduce the distances \nused to avoid others. The existence of social ranking is also a requirement for sheep, \nwhich ensures life in a herd is a low aggression environment (SQUIRES and DAWS, \n1975; ECCLES and SHACKLETON, 1986). This almost aggression-free behaviour \namongst sheep is seen as a result of the particularly long domestification time (GRUB \nand JEWELL, 1966). The sheep was the first farm animal to be domesticated \n(BOESSNECK, 1985). \nThe existing relationships of dominance were not respected in all situations. \nSubdominant dairy sheep obviously ignored the rank order when the resource was \nespecially desirable for them: food (especially concentrate), water and a place to lie. In \nparticular, hunger can lead to increased aggressiveness amongst sheep (SCOTT, 1948; \nARNOLD and MALLER, 1974). 431 \nArch. Tierz. 44(2001)4 \nIt should be noted, that sheep are small compared to cattle or horses and on top ofthat, \nEast Friesian dairy sheep are hornless. Physical attacks by animals ofa higher rank are \nhardly painful for these woolly animals. The high percentage in contradictory results, \nin comparison to those of larger species of animals can be interpreted in this way \n(WAGNON, 1965; SAMBRAUS, 1970; REINHARDT, 1973). The observations done \nby, amongst others, DOVE (1974) and SQUIRES (1975) contradict the results to hand. \nAecording to them, the higher ranked animals always have access to food and water. \nAs well as the effect of the breed, the number of feeding places could be significant \nhere. \nMeaningful results can only be obtained when more than 25% ofthe rank relationships \nhave been determined (BEILHARZ and ZEEB, 1982). This minimum percentage has \nbeen well exceeded in the examination to hand. There were large individual \ndifferences. For many sheep more than 90%, for some 100%, ofthe rank relationships \nto other members of the herd were known. There was, however, one sheep (at \nReinfelderhof farm) for which only 50% of the dominance relationships were \ndetermined. The minimum level required by BEILHARZ and ZEEB has, however, \neven in this individual case, been well exceeded. \nFor the high correlation between social rank and weight, the weight is seen as the \ncause, and the rank as the result. The fighting power of an animal increases with \nincreasing bodyweight and thus increasing amount of muscles. It is less probable that \nthe higher ranked animals acquire better access to the food and thus gain in weight. \nIn all three of the herds there was an obvious connection between social ranking and \nthe age ofthe animals. For sheep, there are no results available for the significance of \nage. It should be remembered that young sheep which enter an established herd, are, \nlighter, have to find their way in an until now unknown territory and have to cope with \nmany new herd members. At first they take on low positions in the rank order. In \nanalogy with cattle, it can be expected that the social ranking shall stay reasonably \nconstant (SAMBRAUS and OSTERKORN, 1974) and thus the rank position of \nneweomers later barely alters. \nThe results show that the twice daily marching order was not eoineidence. Each \nmember of the herd keeps, as far as possible, a certain place in the marching order. \nHere , the social ranking is unimportant, and even the milk yield, which could be the \ncause of a stronger desire to be milked does not appear to have an influence. In one of \nthe herds, the weight of the animals is significant, in another, the age. The latter is a \nreminder ofthe leader function ofthe older, experienced animals amongst others. For \nthese herds, the results of DONALDSON et al. (1967) could be confirmed, which \nrevealed that the lower ranked animals took up the first positions in the ranking order. \nIt could be proven that the milking order, from one milking to the next, was quite \nconstant. Thus, KESZTHELYI and MAROS 's (1992) results were confirmed, who \nverified, with a herd made up of many different breeds, a significant repetition of the \nmilking order occurred. The factors defining the milking order, are to a great extent \nunknown. Only on the farm at Sulzhof, did the results show that lower ranked animals \nappeared earlier in the area in front of the milking parlour. As these are not high \nranked, older or heavier animals, this phenomenon remains unresolved. It is \nimaginable that the concentrate they reeeive in the milking parlour is enough of an 432 \nGR\u00c4SER-HERRMANN; SAMBRAUS: The social behaviour of East Friesian dairy sheep in larger groups \nincentive to encourage them to appear there as early as possible. \nA phenomenon of particular interest is \"intervening\". In this way, aggressive \nbehaviour is nipped in the bud and this aids the maintenance of a peaceful atmosphere \nwithin the cote. Intervening has only been seen amongst goats up until now (KEIL and \nSAMBRAUS, 1998). \n5. Final analysis \nEast Friesian dairy sheep have a distinct social ranking in herds of up to at least 40 \nanimals. This rank order depends on recognition of individuals and thus, is presumably \nnot the case in larger herds of several hundred sheep. The social rank order in \nconnection with the \"intervenors\" has a calming effect on this breed. However, as far \nas the way in which the animals are kept, it should be taken care that even the lower \nranked members of the herd are able to satisfy their needs in every functional sphere. \nThis means a sufficient number of places at the feeding trough easy access to the \ndrinkers and a not too high density among the herd should exist. \nIt is imaginable that East Friesian dairy sheep kept as individuals and those in smaller \ngroups may have a slightly higher milk yield than those in larger groups. This is \nhowever not the result of increased social stress and a lack of bonding with human \nbeings. East Friesian dairy sheep kept as individual animals are often better tended and \nreeeive larger amounts of concentrate. In larger groups, when concentrate was offered \nmore often, the highly ranked animals would sueeeed in acquiring a larger unequal \nproportion. This potential imbalance can be regulated during lactation by providing \nthem with concentrate in the milking parlour aecording to their milk yield. \nReferences \nARNOLD, G.
