Harmon1* , Becky G. Fasth2, Misha Yatskov3, Douglas Kastendick4, Joachim Rock5 \nand Christopher W. Woodall4\nAbstract \nBackground: Recent increases in forest tree mortality should increase the abundance coarse woody detritus (CWD) \nand ultimately lead to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, the time course of carbon release from CWD \nis not well understood. We compiled CWD decomposition rate-constants (i.e., k) to examine how tree species, piece diameter, position (i.e., standing versus downed), canopy openness, and macroclimate influenced k. To illustrate their implications we modeled the effect of species and position on estimates of decomposition-related carbon flux. We examined a subset of currently used models to determine if their structure accounted for these factors.\nResults: Globally k of downed CWD varied at least 244-fold with interspecies variation at individual sites up to 76-fold. \nWhile k generally decreased with increasing piece diameter, under open canopies the opposite occurred. Standing \nCWD sometimes exhibited little decomposition, but sometimes had k  values up to 3 times faster than downed CWD. \nThere was a clear response of k  to mean annual temperature of \u2248 2.6 times per 10 \u2103 ; however, there was consider -\nable variation for a given mean annual temperature related to species, diameter, and position. A key feature of carbon \nrelease from CWD after disturbance was the \u201cevolution\u201d of the ecosystem-level k  value as positions and species mixtures \nof the remaining CWD changed. Variations in decomposition caused by disturbance (e.g., changes in species, positions, sizes, and microclimate) had the potential to cause net carbon fluxes to the atmosphere to be highly nonlinear. While several models currently being used for carbon accounting and assessing land-use/climate change would potentially capture some of these post disturbance changes in fluxes and carbon balances, many would not.\nConclusions: While much has been learned in the last 5 decades about CWD decomposition, to fully understand the \ntime course of carbon release from increased mortality and other aspects of global change a new phase of global CWD \nresearch that is more systematic, experimental, and replicated needs to be initiated. If our findings are to be fully applied in modeling, an approach acknowledging how the rate of carbon release evolves over time should be implemented.\nKeywords: Coarse woody detritus, Decomposition, Forest carbon balance, Forest disturbance consequences, \nHeterotrophic respiration, Tree mortality effects\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

Consequently, in the last decade, considerable \neffort has been made to estimate the amount of mortal\n-\nity related to forest disturbance particularly in temperate and boreal regions (e.g., [4]. For example, recent out\n-\nbreaks of bark beetles have killed trees on 6 to 11\u00a0 mil -\nlion ha in North America in a little over a decade [5]. Fire incidence and severity has been observed to increase in the western US as well as Amazonia in response to cli\n-\nmatic drying [6, 7].

Carbon Balance Manage            (2020) 15:1 \na major tree die off in the Southwestern US [2, 8], west -\nern Canada [9, 10], and southern Europe [11]. While it \nis not completely certain, hurricane incidence and inten -\nsity appear to have both increased; these storms can kill a \nconsiderable amount of live tree biomass with hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita creating 43.9 and 37.9 Tg C of woody \ndetritus, respectively [12]. The resulting influx of detritus can affect stand development processes for decades in some locations [13]. However, a changing climate is not \nthe only factor leading to recent increases in tree mortal\n-\nity: Invasions of diseases such as sudden oak disease (Phy -\ntophthora ramorum) [14] and insects such as the emerald \nash borer (Agrilus planipennis ) [15, 16] and hemlock \nwoolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) [17] are causing wide spread mortality of their new host tree species. Moreo\n-\nver, there is increasing evidence that small scale mortal -\nity (i.e., so-called regular or background mortality) has been increasing in western North America [18, 19] and \nsouthern Europe [11]. In addition to mortality events, if rates of stand development accelerate in response to climate change [20], one would expect greater density-induced tree mortality with concomitant dead wood creation. Taken together, these studies indicate consider\n-\nable amounts of woody carbon are being transferred from live to dead pools by these various causes of mortality and that this process is likely to increase in the future.\nIn addition to \u201cnatural\u201d disturbances, management-\nrelated disturbances can also create woody detritus. Removal of woody detritus after either type of distur\n-\nbance can have major impacts on forest carbon stores as well as the timing of carbon emissions following disturbance. Compared to natural disturbances, man\n-\nagement activities such as salvage harvest have the potential to remove a higher proportion of disturbance generated woody detritus [21]. As salvaged wood is often converted into products (e.g., paper and energy) with a shorter life-span than woody detritus, the gen\n-\neral impact of salvage harvest is to reduce carbon stores [22\u2013 24] and speed the release of carbon to the \natmosphere [25, 26]. The degree to which the stores \nand rate of carbon release are impacted depends on the differences between natural decay-related carbon release versus release from forest product carbon emis\n-\nsions; although we note that because of the paucity of data these life-spans are often assumed to be the same [26]. Given the potential variation in the rate of woody \ndetritus decomposition [21, 27], the specific carbon \npolicy implications of salvage for products and/or fuel reduction are likely to vary widely. Hence, more fully understanding the factors controlling decomposition of woody detritus is important to developing a science-based carbon management policy for forests.Since the time course of mortality-related carbon release \nis not well understood, two simplifying assumptions are commonly used, both of which equate mortality with car\n-\nbon release. The first is to assign mortality to a \u201ccommitted emission\u201d that eventually will be released (e.g., IPCC Tier \n1 guidelines [28]). While undoubtedly true, the influence \nof mortality on the carbon balance depends on the time course of emissions versus uptake by the ecosystem. The second is to assume the system is in steady-state, which \nimplies that the amount being added to the dead pools \nvia mortality is equivalent to the amount being lost to the atmosphere (e.g., [29]). However, since the rate of this dis\n-\nturbance-related mortality appears to be increasing over broad regions, the steady-state assumption is not valid in many cases. Estimating the effect of mortality, therefore, requires one to examine the transient response which is in turn dependent on the decomposition rate of dead wood generated by disturbance-related mortality. The same is true for fully understanding the impact of management actions such as salvage, fuel reduction, and biomass energy production. Moreover, since carbon released earlier to the \natmosphere has more potential to influence climate than \nlater [30], the specific timing of decomposition-related carbon emissions is important.\nWhile decomposition is a fundamental ecological pro\n-\ncess, it is not well understood relative to other processes such as production [21]. Decomposition losses can be divided into those associated with respiration, fragmen\n-\ntation, and leaching [31]. While respiration represents a transfer to the atmosphere, fragmentation and leaching represent transfers within the ecosystem and a change to a smaller size or dissolved form, respectively. The pro\n-\nportion of carbon flowing through these sub-processes is not well quantified, although it is often assumed that respiration comprises the majority. Though it is possible to quantify these processes [32, 33], most studies exam\n-\nining the decomposition of woody detritus quantify the changes of overall mass, density (i.e., mass/volume), and/or volume. To estimate the overall rate of decomposition a single negative exponential model has widely been used:\n where M is the metric of choice (mass, volume, or den\n-\nsity), t is time, and k is the rate-constant of decomposi -\ntion [27]. Although other models have also been used to \ndescribe the course of decomposition to capture the het -\nerogeneous nature of woody detritus or time lags associ -\nated with decomposer colonization [27, 34], the use of \nthe single negative exponential model and the rate con -\nstant k has been widespread as it provides a simple, inte -\ngrated index of this complex process.(1) Mt=M0e\u2212ktPage 3 of 21\n Harmon\u00a0et\u00a0al. Carbon Balance Manage            (2020) 15:1 \nOur objective is to provide insight into the nature of \ntransient emission of carbon from coarse woody debris \ndue to disturbances to refine our understanding of how recent increases in tree mortality could affect the global carbon balance. To achieve this we first review what \nis currently known about the decomposition of coarse \nwoody detritus (CWD) in boreal, temperate and tropi\n-\ncal forests. CWD, defined here as dead woody material \nat least 1 m long and greater than 10\u00a0cm diameter at the thinner end, is the largest share of the dead wood carbon pool generated by major disturbances. Thus, while distur\n-\nbance also generates dead branches as well as dead coarse roots, our analysis focuses on the larger-sized wood. Our review of available data is based on published and unpublished rates of CWD decomposition that we have gathered over the course of several decades. The decom\n-\nposition of dead organic material involves mechanical and chemical processes and depends on decomposer community structure, their development and succession over time, and all the factors influencing their activity ([35\u201338]. Since information on this detailed level across the breadth of global sampling is very scarce, we exam\n-\nined general factors that influence the rate at which CWD decomposes including tree species, size, position (i.e., standing versus downed), canopy openness, and cli\n-\nmate. Finally, we explore the implications of observed decomposition rates on modeling carbon release, exam\n-\nine a range of current modeling approaches, and make suggestions for the next steps in quantifying and mod\n-\neling this important process.\nData sources and\u00a0methods\nThe estimates of CWD decomposition rates used in our analysis were based on both published and unpublished data. For published studies of decomposition rates we selected those based for the most part on individual pieces of CWD. Therefore, studies that estimated decom\n-\nposition rate solely based on inventories of stores/stocks (e.g., [39]) or models (e.g., [40\u201343] were not included. As an exception, we used estimates based on the ratio of mortality and an assumption that the observed store was in steady-state. For unpublished data we used our own databases which have been gathered over the course of several decades. We provide summary estimates based on these data for the many species and locations we have examined. The course of decomposition can be \ndescribed using volume, mass, or density loss of a piece \nof CWD; moreover, different equation types can be used to determine a rate of loss. We analyzed all k values found, because the rate-constants calculated from these different combinations differ less than between studies (ceteris paribus) or species. The influence of the different factors analyzed on k is also irrespective of the way the rate-constant was estimated. As the comparison for all the factors except climate was within a study, this method would not have influenced the relative differences. For climate, we acknowledge that this method may have somewhat reduced the proportion of variance explained by the climatic variable examined.\nThere are three basic methods for determining decom\n-\nposition rates of individual CWD pieces and each may give a different estimate: (A) Chronosequences are the most common and involve a substitution of space for time. While this method can span a considerable time period (i.e., hundreds of years in some cases), there are uncertainties related to the initial condition of the pieces, the dating of mortality, and the uniformity of environ\n-\nmental conditions. (B) Time series (i.e., following indi -\nvidual pieces over time) is an ideal method in terms of knowing the date of mortality and the initial condition of the pieces. These studies typically are short term rel\n-\native to the lifespan of CWD; typically lasting less than 30\u00a0 years. C) Decomposition vectors combine aspects of chronosequences and time series by sampling a wide range of ages (or in some cases decay stages) over two points in time [44]. Since the pieces are resampled, the rate of change over time is more certain than for a chron\n-\nosequence, and since a wide range of states is examined the long-term trend is better represented than for the typical time series. However, since the decomposition vectors for resampled pieces do not estimate an overall rate of change for a species, estimates from the various stages have to be averaged, usually by weighting by the relative time in each stage or state that is examined. This provides estimates similar to chronosequences and time series, but there is uncertainty in terms of the residence time of each stage. Finally, for a population of dead wood pieces one may estimate decomposition rate-constants from the ratio of dead wood input to stores. This assumes that the dead wood store has reached steady-state and is typically applied to forests which have not been subject to major mortality events for considerable time periods.\nIn addition to compiling data on decomposition-rate \nconstants for CWD, we also used site description data when provided by the articles. Climate was character\n-\nized by mean annual temperature (MAT) and average total annual precipitation (TAP). In many cases tem\n-\nperature was described as a range (typically the average for the coldest and warmest months), which we aver\n-\naged to approximate the MAT. When more than one site was used and the decomposition data were reported by site we used the site-specific climate data. Otherwise we averaged climatic data for the sites. For articles that did not provide climatic data, but the location was described adequately, we used the location to search online for cli\n-\nmate data to approximate temperature and precipitation Page 4 of 21 Harmon\u00a0et\u00a0al. Carbon Balance Manage            (2020) 15:1 \ntypically from a nearby meteorological station. However, \nthere were some studies in which the location was too vague to do this and they were excluded from the analy\n-\nses involving climate. To provide a more consistent esti -\nmate of precipitation and temperature we also used the location given by the studies and the WorldClim2 data\n-\nbase [ 45] at a 2.5\u00a0 min resolution to determine monthly \nvalues that were then either summed or averaged to give TAP and MAT, respectively.\nAlthough other studies have used involved statistical \nanalysis such as linear mixed modeling to derive relation\n-\nships between variables such as species, size, and climate versus decomposition rate-constants (e.g., [40\u201342]), we feel the overall sampling design with respect to the fac\n-\ntors we examined is severely unbalanced, that differences in field and laboratory methods influence the results of analyses and that these statistical methods, despite their high level of sophistication, are thus inappropriate. For example, while using meta-analysis would be desirable, it requires a degree of randomization not present in most of the studies we analyzed. Moreover, even computa\n-\ntion of a regional or global average and dispersion sta -\ntistics would be misleading given the subjective nature of the overall sampling design. We therefore used alter\n-\nnative methods to document the effect of the factors of interest. We first noted whether a factor had been exam\n-\nined and an effect had been reported. The next step was to quantify the sign and magnitude of the effect. In the case of the species effect we used the ratio of the fastest to the slowest decomposition-rate constant. For position effects, we used the ratio of standing dead to downed dead decomposition rate-constant as the index. For size, we only noted the sign of the effect given that range of sizes examined was so variable that a comparison of mag\n-\nnitude could be misleading. For the comparison of open- versus closed-canopy sites (i.e., those with and without overstory trees) we also noted the sign of the effect in part because there were few studies that actually made this comparison and hence an average magnitude would be too uncertain.\nIn the case of three variables, initial wood density \n(IWD), MAT, and TAP , it was possible to use regres\n-\nsion analysis to assess an effect; however, even here caution must be exercised in interpretation as many other factors (e.g., species decay resistance, size, and position) could be confounded with these variables. For IWD statistical models we used linear regression (proc GLM, [46]) for the k  estimates with associated \nIWD to determine the relationship for the entire data\n-\nset as well as for each major forest biome (i.e., boreal, temperate, tropical). In the case of TAP we used linear and polynomial regression (proc GLM, [46]) to assess a relationship with k  and did not examine the effect of seasonality. For MAT we used non-linear regres\n-\nsion (proc NLIN, [46]) to determine the Q10 (Quotient 10) for the dataset as a whole, standing versus downed CWD, and species with low decay resistance versus those with moderate to high decay resistance. While there are other models of temperature response, Q10 is perhaps the simplest in that it determines the increase in a biological process with a 10 C increase in tempera\n-\nture. Analysis of the climate variables was done for the values reported, those indicated by WorldClim2, and for a hybrid set of values that replaced WorldClim2 precipitation predictions when local estimates with high levels of confidence were available.\nAfter synthesizing what is known about decomposi\n-\ntion rates of CWD and its controls across global forest biomes we explored their implications for modeling car\n-\nbon release. In particular we used a sensitivity analysis to explore the potential effects of species differences and the transfer of CWD from one position (standing) to another (downed). While theoretical, this analysis was guided by the differences observed in the dataset between species and positions. Two aspects of species effects were exam\n-\nined: the difference among species in terms of 1) k and 2) abundance. We modelled decomposition for a total of 10 \u201cspecies\u201d with a ratio of fastest to slowest k ranging \nbetween either 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. The first ratio indicated all species had identical k\u2019s, whereas the latter indicated up to a 16-fold difference among species. For all simula\n-\ntions the unweighted average k was kept at 0.05 per year and species k\u2019s were assigned at equal intervals (i.e., 0.1 \nthe difference between the fastest and slowest k;  Addi\n-\ntional file\u00a0 1: Figure S4). Five different abundance patterns \nof species were assessed: (1) uniform (i.e., all the species contributed the same amount of input), (2) a normal dis\n-\ntribution in which the species with average k\u2019s made the greatest contribution, (3) bimodal distribution in which fastest and slowest decomposing species made the great\n-\nest contribution, (4) a \u201cslow\u201d biased distribution in which slowest decomposing species made the greatest contri\n-\nbution and (5) a \u201cfast\u201d biased distribution in which the fastest decomposing species made the greatest contribu\n-\ntion (Additional file\u00a0 1: Figure S5). To assess the effects of \nvariation in k and species abundance we used the relative difference in carbon flux between a particular case (e.g., twofold difference in maximum and minimum k and uniform distribution) and the reference case in which all species had the same k.\nTo assess the impact changes in microenviron\n-\nment associated with changes in position we modeled the common situation in which a disturbance cre\n-\nated standing dead trees (i.e., snags) and these snags fall over time. Snag fall rate was simulated by assum\n-\ning snags either started to fall immediately or needed a Page 5 of 21\n Harmon\u00a0et\u00a0al. Carbon Balance Manage            (2020) 15:1 \n10-year period for snag fall to begin. Once snags began \nto fall three time frames for the majority of snags to fall were explored: 15\u00a0years, 30\u00a0years, and 60\u00a0years. It was assumed that the k of maximum decomposition was \n0.05 per year. In one case, representing the situation in mesic to arid climates, it was assumed that snags would decompose slower than logs (i.e., downed wood) and the ratio of snag to log decomposition k \u2019s was either 1, \n0.5, 0.25, 0.125, or 0. In the other case it was assumed that snags would decompose faster than logs and the log to snag decomposition k  ratio was either 1, 0.5, 0.25, \n0.125, or 0. The latter case represents a common situa\n-\ntion in boreal forests in which the soil is saturated and mosses quickly over top logs [47]. To assess the effect of transitions between positions, we quantified the timing and magnitude of the maximum carbon flux.\nOur analysis focused primarily on the release of carbon \nfrom CWD. However, to understand the impact of this release on the overall ecosystem carbon balance one has to also consider net uptake via net primary production (NPP). We present some preliminary, but useful exam\n-\nples by using a relatively simple model to examine the effects of mortality on forest ecosystem carbon balance as indicated by net ecosystem production (NEP). There were two pools, live and dead, that represented the store of wood carbon at the landscape to regional level (Addi\n-\ntional file\u00a0 1: Figure S11). The NPP base-level was assumed \nto be 2 MgC/ha/year, which represented an average over succession. The mortality base-level was assumed to be 0.01 per year, which corresponded to a maximum tree life-span (at least for 99% of the trees) of 460\u00a0years. Three base-levels of decomposition rate-constants were used: 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 per year to correspond the majority of observed values in boreal and temperate forests. NEP was calculated as NPP minus decomposition-related losses which were assumed to be primarily from respiration.\nNet changes in live stores were modeled as NPP minus \nmortality losses. The latter was calculated from the mor\n-\ntality rate-constant and the live store in the previous time step. Net changes in dead stores were modeled as the mortality losses from live stores minus the decomposi\n-\ntion loss. The latter was calculated from the decomposi -\ntion rate-constant and the dead store in the previous time step. NPP , mortality, and decomposition were altered using a step function (smoothed by a 20\u00a0 year window) that indicated the duration and magnitude of the change (Additional file\u00a01: Figure S12).\nTo provide a sense of how CWD-related carbon is \nmodeled in global change-related analyzes, we con\n-\nducted a short review of how this pool is treated in for -\nest and vegetation models currently used (e.g., in carbon accounting under either the Kyoto Protocol or European Union legislation [48]). We also looked at models used in in the \u201cInter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project\u201d (ISIMIP) \u201cforests\u201d and \u201cbiomes\u201d sectors. The full list of these models can be found at [49]. ISIMIP is \na scientific community-driven \u201cframework for consist\n-\nently projecting the impacts of climate change across affected sectors and spatial scales\u201d aimed at improving information about possible futures by delivering compa\n-\nrable projections based on different models, but identi -\ncal input data [49]. Results derived from the models we reviewed have been cited in the previous IPCC Assess\n-\nment Reports, and results from current efforts using the models are very likely to be cited in the next Assessment Report (AR 6). Therefore, we were interested in how decomposition of woody detritus was treated in these models and we used the information presented or cited on the respective models\u2019 ISIMIP web page [49] availa\n-\nble 18th December 2019. Based on the structure of these models (e.g., highly aggregated soil-based models to many CWD-related pools), we considered the degree to which models could mimic the variation in decomposi\n-\ntion rates, temporal fluxes, and balances of carbon in dis -\nturbed forests we found in our analysis.\nResults and\u00a0discussion\nGeneral description of\u00a0studies\nLocation of\u00a0estimates\nGeographically the majority of estimates (61%) have been \nin temperate forests, with the highest concentration in North America (Fig.\u00a0 1, Additional file\u00a0 2: Table S-1). Esti\n-\nmates from boreal forests comprised 25% of the total, the largest share of these were from Scandinavia and north\n-\nwestern Russia. Despite some of the earliest estimates of CWD decomposition rates having been made in tropi\n-\ncal forests [50], very few estimates have since come from tropical forests (14%). This lack of estimates may be in part due to the aggregation of species. Another notable geographic pattern was the lack of data from the south\n-\nern hemisphere, although Australia and New Zealand represent a notable area of concentrated work in that hemisphere.\nClimatic conditions examined\nThe climatic conditions in the studies examined in our synthesis were quite broad (Fig.\u00a0 2). Based on the val\n-\nues reported in studies, MAT ranged from \u2212  3.2 to \n27\u00a0\u2103 and TAP ranged from 216 to 4200\u00a0mm per year. \nFor the WorldClim2 database MAT ranged from \u2212 1.81 \nto 26.8\u00a0\u2103 and TAP ranged from 490 to 4058\u00a0 mm per \nyear. Although there was a strong relationship between the climate reported by studies and WorldClim2, some notable exceptions existed particularly for precipitation in mountainous regions (see Additional file\u00a0 1). While \nmany regions of climatic space appeared well sampled, Page 6 of 21 Harmon\u00a0et\u00a0al. Carbon Balance Manage            (2020) 15:1 \nthere was a sparsity of data from subtropical (17 to \n22\u00a0\u2103) as well as warm, moist sites (> 1500\u00a0 mm TAP). \nIn addition, temperate-arid woodlands such as those in the southwestern US were poorly represented, although this region has also been subject to considerable recent disturbance [8 ].\nEstimation method and\u00a0uncertainty\nA total of 295 estimates of CWD decomposition rate-constants (i.e., k ) from 78 different data sources were reported (Additional file\u00a0 2: Table S-1). Of these, 71% \nwere chronosequence-based, 20% were time series-based, 5% were decomposition vector-based, 3% were based on steady-state estimates, and 1% relied on a mix of methods. Change in density (48% of cases) and mass (50% of estimates) were used most to determine decom\n-\nposition rates and volume the least (< 1% of cases). For \nroughly one-third of the estimates the standard error of k was reported, with an average relative value of \n23%. There was considerable range in this index of k \nestimate variability: the lowest was 1% and the highest 300%. Seven (6%) of the estimates had a relative stand\n-\nard error of over 50%, either because of low values of k (4 cases) or low sample size (3 cases). The vast majority of estimates (78 cases or 70%) of k  had a relative stand\n-\nard error of less than 20%. Moreover, a large share (46 cases or 40%) had relative uncertainty less than 10%. This suggests that when adequately sampled k differ\n-\nences of more than 20% could be putatively viewed as significantly different.\nRange of\u00a0estimates\nThe slowest rate of decomposition occurred in snags of conifer species, with a k of effectively zero, but for some species (e.g., Eucalyptus camaldulensis) downed pieces also had very slow rates of decomposition (0.004 per year) [51]. The fastest rate of decomposition (0.975 per year) was estimated for the tropical species Heliocarpus \nFig. 1 Location of studies that have determined coarse woody detritus decomposition rates (forests indicated by green shaded land areas)\nFig. 2 Climatic conditions of decomposition studies for coarse \nwoody detritus based on climate reported by studiesPage 7 of 21\n Harmon\u00a0et\u00a0al. Carbon Balance Manage            (2020) 15:1 \nappendiculatus (Malvaceae) [52] (Additional file\u00a0 2: Table \nS-1). This data suggest that downed CWD decomposition \nrates can globally vary at least 244-fold. Expressed as the time required to decompose 95% of the initial mass, these data indicate downed CWD could last as short as 3\u00a0years or as long as 750\u00a0 years. The longevity based on these studies may be underestimated given that well decom\n-\nposed Thuja  logs in western Canada have been dated to \nhave died at least 1200\u00a0years before present [53] implying a decomposition rate-constant below 0.0025 per year as the potential minimum. This suggests that downed CWD longevity can vary almost 400-fold globally.\nFactors influencing k\nSpecies controls\nA total of 114 species in 59 genera of trees have had some \nestimate of k determined, although this is an underesti -\nmate in that several tropical studies have reported val -\nues for an aggregate of species. As a reference, there are approximately 60,000 tree species in approximately 4370 genera worldwide [54]. Of the approximately 247 plant families containing trees, 29 have been sampled, with the majority (53%) of observations in one: Pinaceae. Of the 36 studies in which multiple species were sampled, all found species differences in k which ranged from as little as 30% difference (marginally significant given the rela\n-\ntive uncertainty reported) to a 76-fold difference among species. In the Pacific Northwest of USA, a \u2248 10-fold dif\n-\nference has been observed with Alnus  and Thuja  having \nk\u2019s of 0.08 and 0.007 per year, respectively [55]. In North Carolina, hardwood species had k\u2019s ranging from 0.015 to 0.261 per year, equating to a 17-fold difference [56]. In dry tropical forests a 76-fold difference was observed [57]. Although the species were not identified, [58] reported a 44-fold difference among species. These large differences were typically at sites having genera with high decay resistance present (e.g., Manilkara , Thuja , Junipe\n-\nrus, Robinia ). However, even when the decay resistance \nof the genera was low (e.g., Betula and Pinus ), at least \na two-fold difference in decomposition rate-constants commonly occurred.\nThere are likely multiple factors influencing tree species \ndifferences including variations in maximum size, ana\n-\ntomical structure, chemical nature, and the decomposers present. One hypothesis to explain tree species differ\n-\nences is that initial density is related to decomposition rates, with lower density species decomposing faster than denser ones [59]. Regression analysis indicated this to be the case for tropical species; however, the opposite was true for boreal and temperate species (Fig.\u00a0 3, Table\u00a0 1). \nConsidering all species together there was no significant relationship between wood density and k. The negative \nrelationship in tropical tree species may have had several causes. First, density is often increased by the presence of extractives some of which are toxic to decomposers [36]. Second, softer, lower density wood is probably more attractive to termites and other invertebrate decompos\n-\ners [60, 61] and the presence of these insects can greatly \nincrease decomposition rates ([31, 37]. The positive \nrelationship suggested by the analysis of temperate and boreal species may have been related in part to the gener\n-\nally lower density of conifer species, which tend to have lower decomposition rates than angiosperms. For exam\n-\nple, while some low density temperate woods had rela -\ntively high k\u2019s, one of the lowest density conifers (Thuja ) \nalso had one of the lowest values of k.\nWhile the studies we examined generally did not deter -\nmine the effects of decomposers (see [62] for an exception and [37] for a general review on invertebrate decompos\n-\ners), the most obvious cause of interspecific variation in terms of decomposition is related to the presence of decay inhibiting extractives in heartwood. The sapwood for most species at a site decomposes at relatively similar \nFig. 3 Relationship between initial wood density and coarse woody \ndetritus decomposition rate-constant for boreal, temperate, and \ntropical species\nTable 1 Linear regression models for\u00a0 the\u00a0 relationship \nbetween\u00a0 initial wood density (IWD) and\u00a0 decomposition \nrate-constant (k)\nThe form of the regression model was: k = a + b* IWDBiome A b r2P N\nOverall 0.083 (0.037) 0.009 (0.075) 0.001 0.903 199\nBoreal \u2212 0.0480 (0.027) 0.211 (0.065) 0.147 0.002 62\nTemperate \u2212 0.050 (0.023) 0.224 (0.046) 0.187 0.058 102\nTropical 0.892 (0.098) \u2212 1.043 (0.157) 0.588 < 0.0001 33Page 8 of 21 Harmon\u00a0et\u00a0al. Carbon Balance Manage            (2020) 15:1 \nrates, whereas heartwood decomposition rate varies to a \nmuch larger degree [63]. Since sapwood and heartwood have very similar anatomical structure and mostly dif\n-\nfer in terms of extractives, this difference in tissue type is likely due to the latter. For example, when studying the decomposition of 13 species in Europe, [36] found the strongest negative correlations with decomposition rates for heartwood presence and organic extractives. Although the decomposition of relatively few tree species have been estimated (see above), considerable knowledge exists on the decay resistance of many commercial spe\n-\ncies used in wood products and construction [64]. We compared the natural durability ratings of heartwood compiled by [65] to the decomposition rate-constants observed (Fig.\u00a0 4). This indicates there was considerable \nvariation for species with low to no decay resistance and less for those that were highly decay resistant for each of the climatic zones. This may be caused by the fact that as decay resistance increases, it overtakes other factors such as position and climate as controls. However, some of this variation may also be caused by the fact that decay rat\n-\ning systems tend to combine species that are quite differ -\nent in the least resistant class (e.g., species in the genera Betula, Fagus , Populus, and Pinus  are all considered the \nsame). Hence, while wood of these genera is not particu\n-\nlarly decay resistant as building materials, it did differ in terms of k\u2019s often by a factor of 2 or more. Another prob\n-\nlem is that decay ratings are based on heartwood, but the proportion of resistant heartwood relative to total wood in a species is also important. For example, although Quercus species have similar heartwood decay resistance, Quercus prinus boles decomposed almost twice as fast as Quercus coccinea, because the former has substantially more sapwood than the latter [66].Effect of\u00a0piece size\nOf the 27 studies that have tested for a size effect (typi -\ncally expressed as diameter), 22 (81%) identified an effect. The general theoretical prediction is that decomposition should decrease with increasing diameter given that the decrease in surface area to volume ratio with increasing diameter limits exchange of gasses, decomposer access, etc. In addition, the larger the diameter, the more time required to colonize a CWD piece and the more heart\n-\nwood that is present, both of which could decrease decomposition rates [27]. For 16 (62%) of the studies, k decreased with increasing diameter. However, k did not always decrease with increasing diameter; 5 (19%) studies found a positive effect of increasing diameter. These were all for open areas following harvest. One found a size effect, but an increase for one species and a decrease for the other [67]. The lack of size effect might be explained by the limited range of diameters examined. The surface area to volume ratio changes most for diameters that are less than 10\u00a0 cm. For example, between a diameter of 1 and 10\u00a0 cm the surface area to volume ratio changes an order of magnitude from 4 to 0.4. A similar order of mag\n-\nnitude change occurs in going from 10 to 100\u00a0cm (0.4 to 0.04). This indicates that if the CWD diameter range for some studies were too limited (e.g., 10 to 20\u00a0cm) or too high (e.g., 50 to 100\u00a0 cm), a size effect would have been hard to detect. Despite the general theory, there is no reason that decreasing the surface area to volume ratio should always decrease decomposition rates. The posi\n-\ntive effect of diameter in dry environments may also have been related to the surface area:volume ratio, but in this environment decreasing surface area to volume may slow drying. Hence, smaller pieces dried faster than larger ones and their decomposition was more limited by insuf\n-\nficient moisture in dry environments.\nStanding versus\u00a0downed position\nMortality causes have very different profiles in terms of the degree they create standing versus downed CWD (i.e., the position). Given that standing CWD is more exposed to drying and subject to lower precipitation input, stand\n-\ning CWD is generally drier than downed dead wood. However, given that moisture may be too low or too high to support decomposition, the effect of position could be dependent on the overall climate [21]. Therefore, under\n-\nstanding the degree to which CWD position influences decomposition across a wide range of climates is critical to understanding CWD dynamics across a host of dis\n-\nturbance agents. Unfortunately there have been only 7 studies in which the decomposition rates of these two positions have been compared and reported. Of the 23 species comparisons we found, 7 indicated standing CWD decomposed faster than downed CWD; 3 indicated < 10% \nFig. 4 Relationship between decay resistance rating of heartwood \n(according [65]) and decomposition rate-constant for three \nclimatic zones. Decay resistance ratings: 0 = no to little resistance, \n1 = moderate resistance, 2 = resistant, and 3 = highly resistantPage 9 of 21\n Harmon\u00a0et\u00a0al. Carbon Balance Manage            (2020) 15:1 \ndifference between positions; and 13 indicated stand -\ning CWD decomposed slower than downed CWD. The \nmagnitude of the position effect can be substantial and approached that of the effect of species. Standing CWD decomposition rate-constants can be more than 3 times that of downed CWD (1 case) or less than 1/3rd (7 cases). Lower decomposition rates of standing relative to downed CWD was generally assumed to be related to lower mois\n-\nture content of the former position. In dry climates this restricts the colonization and activity of decomposers. In some cases standing CWD density and/or mass appeared to slightly increase over time (i.e., the k  was negative), but \nthis was likely due to shrinkage of the wood and not an actual gain in mass. However, there are also particular genera (e.g., Betula) which have bark that appear to retain moisture regardless of climate or position and these spe\n-\ncies had either little difference between positions or had faster standing than downed CWD decomposition. Alter\n-\nnatively it may be that species with particularly fast colo -\nnization by decomposers (e.g., those in the genus Abies) were less influenced by the drier condition of standing dead stems than ones with slower colonization.\nEffect of\u00a0canopy openness\nAs indicated under the analysis of size effects, the amount of tree canopy remaining after disturbance can influence decomposition responses. A more open condi\n-\ntion will lead to more solar radiation hitting the surface of the CWD leading to potential photodegradation [68] and in addition should lead to warmer and drier condi\n-\ntions that could either favor or retard decomposition. Despite these important potential effects, there were only two studies that specifically examined the effect of can\n-\nopy cover on CWD decomposition by comparing open versus closed sites. In one case, representing a moist tem\n-\nperate forest, there was little difference between sites that had been clear-cut with those that remained intact [69]. In the second study, representing boreal forests, open sites had higher decomposition rates than closed forest [70]. These differential responses may be due to several factors. For CWD that takes centuries to decompose, open conditions may only be present a small proportion of the decomposition processing time. Moreover, large understory plants can provide substantial reductions in \nthe solar radiation hitting downed CWD despite the lack \nof tree cover. Hence, closed canopy conditions may be effectively created by plants other than trees. The effect of canopy openness may interact with climate: in cold, wet climates opening the canopy might warm the CWD more than it dries it, thus speeding decomposition [70]. In a dry, warm climate, opening the canopy might dry and heat the CWD to the point decomposition is reduced (e.g., [71]).Climatic controls\nAlthough climate is an important control of CWD decomposition rates [72], it has been difficult to estimate the effect in many broad-scale studies (e.g., [70, 73]. This \nis partly due to the fact tree species often have limited climatic ranges which suggests that climatic responses within a species might be limited. Examining multiple species over a larger climate gradient avoids this prob\n-\nlem, but may confound species effects with climatic ones. There appears to have been a positive relationship between MAT and CWD k  (Fig.\u00a0 5); however, there was \nconsiderable range of k  for a given temperature related \nprimarily to species and positional differences. This range appeared to broaden as MAT increases, which suggests that species without decay resistance were more respon\n-\nsive than those with high decay resistance. When all spe -\ncies and positions were examined, non-linear regression indicated a Q10 of 2.50\u20132.60 with a base value of k  of \n0.058\u20130.061 per year at 10\u00a0 \u2103 depending on the climatic \ndataset used (Table\u00a0 2). After reducing the data to only \nCWD in the downed position, non-linear regression esti\n-\nmated a Q10 of 2.50\u20132.59 with a base value of k  of 0.059 \nper year at 10\u00a0 \u2103. Further reducing the data to only spe -\ncies with minimal decay resistance gave a Q10 of 2.68\u20132.75 with a base value for k  of 0.064\u20130.065 per year at \n10\u00a0\u2103 depending on the climatic database used. The value \nof the parameter estimates did not change greatly as the data were narrowed from all observations to just species with low decay resistance; however, the amount of varia\n-\ntion explained by the models increased. The fact that the parameter estimates did not vary is likely due to the highly unbalanced sample \u201cdesign\u201d dominated by downed CWD with low decay resistance. This indicates that an overall analysis of controlling factors could be highly misleading and likely to find that the factors with greater sampling \nFig. 5 Relationship between mean annual temperature and \ndecomposition rate-constant k for species of different decay \nresistance (0 = lowest; 3 = highest)Page 10 of 21 Harmon\u00a0et\u00a0al. Carbon Balance Manage            (2020) 15:1 \nwould account for the majority of variance. For example, \nusing the limited number of cases (24) in which standing CWD k was estimated indicated a Q10 of less than 1, an \nindication that as MAT increased standing CWD became drier. The Q10 for species with some decay resistance (64 cases) was 1.57\u20131.61 with a base value of k  of 0.051\u20130.053 \nper year at 10\u00a0 \u2103. While this is consistent with the hypoth\n-\nesis proposed by [73] that species with a higher decay resistance have a lower Q10, the low sample size leads to considerable parameter uncertainty. The few species examined with very high decay resistance suggest that the Q10 approached 1; however, without more data, par\n-\nticularly in warmer climates, this response was difficult to estimate with any certainty. Additional data, particularly in the tropics, would give considerable insight into the generality of Meentemeyer\u2019s [74] hypothesis of the sub\n-\nstrate quality-climatic interaction being the key control of global decomposition patterns.\nRegression analysis indicated there was no significant \nlinear or polynomial relationship between k and TAP for any of the climatic databases we examined. The range in k appeared to increase greatly once precipitation exceeds 1000\u00a0mm (Fig.\u00a0 6). However, this could also be related to \nthe diversity of species found at these wetter sites as well as the general correlation between MAT and TAP for the sites of CWD decomposition studies (Fig.\u00a0 2). From this \nanalysis we do not necessarily conclude that precipita\n-\ntion per se is an unimportant control of decomposition; rather that other aspects such as seasonality and mois\n-\nture balance should be explored more fully.\nInteraction of\u00a0factors\nGiven the unbalanced nature of the overall experimen -\ntal design of the data we compiled, we largely examined, with several notable exceptions such as the effects of ini\n-\ntial wood density and climate variables, the relative range of k\u2019s for a given factor. In comparing factors one can consider either the degree it influences the CWD decom\n-\nposition process or the uncertainty in the range within a factor. Based on our analysis it would appear that the relative range within a factor, in terms of influence, ranks approximately as follows: species > climate > posi\n-\ntion > size > canopy openness. We acknowledge that for \ncanopy openness, the paucity of data likely underesti -\nmate the potential range in this factor. We rank the fac -\ntors examined in terms of uncertainty as follows: canopy openness > position > species, climate, and size. Our rank\n-\ning of uncertainty is strongly influenced by how widely a factor has been examined. The lower relative uncer\n-\ntainty related to species, climate, and size should not be interpreted that additional information, particularly at the mechanistic level, is not warranted. Rather, it means that so little data on canopy openness and position exist that insights into sign and magnitude of their controls are scant.Table 2 Q10 relationship between\u00a0mean annual temperature (MAT) and\u00a0decomposition rate-constant (k)\nThe general form of the model was k = k10Q10((MAT\u221210)/10)\na Reported indicates that the MAT reported by a study was used; WC2 signifies WorldClim 2 dataModel k10 Q10 r2p N\nAll/reporteda0.058 (0.006) 2.60 (0.21) 0.557 < 0.001 289\nAll/WC2a0.061 (0.006) 2.50 (0.20) 0.542 < 0.001 289\nDowned/reported 0.059 (0.007) 2.59 (0.22) 0.562 < 0.001 263\nDowned/WC2 0.062 (0.007) 2.48 (0.21) 0.546 < 0.001 263\nStanding/reported 0.013 (0.008) 0.575 (0.33) 0.500 < 0.010 24\nStanding/WC2 0.013 (0.009) 0.509 (0.40) 0.500 < 0.010 24\nLow decay resistance/reported 0.063 (0.007) 2.75 (0.23) 0.620 < 0.001 228\nLow decay resistance/WC2 0.065 (0.007) 2.68 (0.22) 0.601 < 0.001 228\nSome decay resistance/reported 0.051 (0.008) 1.61 (0.25) 0.552 < 0.001 64\nSome decay resistance/WC 0.053 (0.008) 1.57 (0.24) 0.548 < 0.001 64\nFig. 6 Relationship between mean total annual precipitation and \ndecomposition rate-constants of coarse woody detritus for species of \ndifferent decay resistance (0 = lowest; 3 = highest)Page 11 of 21\n Harmon\u00a0et\u00a0al. Carbon Balance Manage            (2020) 15:1 \nWhile assigning the individual factors importance \nin terms of the degree of process control and uncer -\ntainty has value, it misses a major finding of our analy -\nsis: the evidence that many, if not all the factors interact \nin important ways. Hence, while species rates of CWD decomposition in tropical forests can range up to 76-fold, MAT can restrict this range to several-fold in boreal forests. Similarly, if the relationship we found between MAT and standing CWD decomposition rates were proven real, then warming and drying of the climate would cause standing CWD to decompose more slowly than downed CWD to the degree that the two positions would markedly diverge. Position is also likely to interact with size, particularly in drier climates, with small diam\n-\neter standing CWD being more limited by low moisture than larger diameter standing CWD. Although the effect of canopy openness is not clear, it is likely that climate, size, and position interact with this factor. This suggests that responses as divergent as a decrease, an increase, and no response of decomposition rate to increased canopy openness are all possible. Our conclusion is that while additional information about individual factors is warranted, the major uncertainty is associated with interactions.\nTime course of\u00a0disturbance\u2011related fluxes\nTo give a sense of the potential variation in the time course of carbon release following forest disturbance, we used decomposition data to model two cases: a hurricane in which the majority of CWD created was downed, and a beetle-kill in which the majority was created as standing CWD. In both cases, we assumed that all decomposition losses were associated with respiration and not fragmen\n-\ntation and leaching. We acknowledge that both of the latter occur, but for illustrative purposes we assumed res\n-\npiration was the only pathway of loss.\nCarbon release after\u00a0hurricane\nHurricane Fran, which occurred in 1996, added 48\u00a0 Mg of dead tree mass per ha [75]. We used the composition of the forest in North Carolina found by [75] to estimate the proportion of species killed and then applied their k\u2019s to estimate the respiration flux over time. This indi\n-\ncated that many genera decomposed within the 20\u00a0year measurement period (Acer, Carya , Fagus , Liriodendron, \nand Liquidambar), but others (Juniperus  and Quercus) \nwould take at least twice as long. The effect of the spe\n-\ncies mix changed after disturbance causing the decom -\nposition rate-constant to \u201cevolve\u201d in a non-linear manner over time. Initially, the weighted average k for this site was 0.151 per year, but at 9\u00a0years after disturbance it was 0.09 per year and at 50\u00a0years it was 0.057 per year. This highlights the problem of using the average k of species: the overall k converged over time toward that of the slow\n-\nest decomposing species. Similarly the decomposition flux evolved over time: for 9\u00a0years after the disturbance decomposition-related flux was larger than if the forest were entirely comprised of slower decomposing genera, but after that point in time the flux was higher than if the forest were entirely comprised of faster decompos\n-\ning genera (Fig.\u00a0 7a). Using the initial average k, even if \nweighted for species abundance, did not address these non-linear effects. The large range in species-related decomposition observed suggests that for many locations the mixture of the species dying can have a very large impact on subsequent release of carbon. Specifically, when abundant species differ by an order of magnitude in terms of k\u2019s (which based on our analysis was not an uncommon situation), the potential for non-linear tem\n-\nporal patterns of carbon release was high. Although we did not examine the effect of size on temporal dynam\n-\nics, we expect the effect on evolution of the k would have been similar to that of species.\nCarbon release after\u00a0beetle\u2011kill\nOur beetle-kill example occurred in Fraser Experi -\nmental Forest, Colorado where between 2004 and 2009 \u2248 100\u00a0 Mg/ha of live tree biomass was killed, a live \nstore typical of an older stand in these forests [76, 77]. \nSince there was some downed CWD before the beetle-kill, we assumed an initial downed store of 20\u00a0 Mg/ha. We also assumed that standing Pinus  CWD began to fall \nafter 10\u00a0 years (consistent with our observations during sampling) and that it would take an additional 30\u00a0 years for the standing CWD to fall completely [78]. Based on our unpublished k estimates [52] (Additional file\u00a0 2: Table \nS-1), the decomposition rate of standing dead Pinus  trees \nwas 10% of the downed ones. This difference in posi\n-\ntions was likely caused by the dry climate present at the site, which experiences an extended summer drought. Because of this difference in standing and downed k\u2019s and the lag in snag fall, a delay in the decomposition-related flux occurred, with the peak loss to the atmosphere 25\u201328\u00a0years after the disturbance (Fig.\u00a0 7b). In this exam\n-\nple the decomposition-related flux was highly non-linear and did not stay within the bounds defined by the loss that would have occurred if all the CWD remain standing or start in the downed position. As with the North Car\n-\nolina hurricane example, the k evolved over time as the mixture of standing versus downed CWD pools changed. Therefore, using an average k gives a very misleading pre\n-\ndiction of decomposition-related fluxes both in terms of value, but also in terms of temporal complexity. Although in this example decomposition rates increased with snag fall, there are likely situations in which the opposite is true. On hydric sites dead trees may become waterlogged Page 12 of 21 Harmon\u00a0et\u00a0al. Carbon Balance Manage            (2020) 15:1 \nafter they fall slowing or arresting decomposition. For \nexample, in moist boreal forests with relatively fast moss growth, downed wood can be buried and accumulate over time [47]. If standing CWD k\u2019s are also low, then it is possible that decomposition-related fluxes would be minimal after disturbance at these sorts of sites. It is also possible for disturbance to alter hydrology sufficiently to create site conditions that favor waterlogging of CWD [79].\nImplications of\u00a0results for\u00a0modeling\nThe previous examples indicated that the differences in species and positions can cause the ecosystem level k to evolve over time. In this section we further examine the implications of this behavior on modeling the trajectory of carbon release from CWD from a wider set of cases. It should be noted that we did not examine the effect of size differences; however, these would be analogous to that of species although of smaller magnitude given that difference in sizes was generally less than an order of magnitude.\nSpecies influences\nSubstantial relative differences occurred from the ref -\nerence case in which species all had the same k (Fig.\u00a0 8). \nAs might be expected, when the slowest decomposing species was most abundant the initial flux was between 18 and 45% slower than the reference case depending on the fastest to slowest k ratio. Conversely, fluxes after 20-40 y were in some cases over 100% higher. The oppo\n-\nsite temporal pattern occurred for distributions in which the fastest species was most abundant. While the effects of the other distributions were less dramatic, there were also notable deviations from the reference case even when distributions resulted in an average k close to that of the reference case (e.g., uniform, normal, and bimodal distributions). Although the absolute differences between the cases after 50\u00a0years was low because \u2248 8% of the car\n-\nbon remained at that point in time, the deviations occur -\nring earlier were large in both a relative and absolute sense (Additional file\u00a0 1: Figure S6). This indicates that \none needs to model dead wood carbon release in a man\n-\nner that accounts for both the differences in k among species (or classes of species) and the relative abundance of the species.\nPosition influences\nWhen snag k was lower than that of logs, the time to reach the maximum carbon flux exhibited a lag that increased as the difference between the two positions in terms of k increased and as the time for snags to com\n-\npletely fall increased (Fig.\u00a0 9a). The occurrence of a lag \nbefore snags begin to fall also increased the lag in tim -\ning of the maximum flux even when the time of complete snag fall was similar. The value of the maximum carbon flux was also influenced by the rate of snag fall, but not the snag to log k ratio, at least for values less than 0.5 (Fig.\u00a0 9b). When the snag k was higher than that of logs \na very different response was observed because there was no lag in the maximum flux (Additional file\u00a0 1: Figure \nS10). The amount left after 100\u00a0years (i.e., the time when 99% of the carbon would have been released with a k of \nFig. 7 Temporal patterns of decomposition-related carbon flux from CWD following major disturbance: examples of a.

It should be noted that while this analysis focused on standing versus downed CWD, similar responses would likely have occur if one contrasted downed and buried CWD.\nEffect on\u00a0carbon balance\nWhen we varied the duration of the mortality increase (in this particular experiment the increase was set to be 10% higher than the base level), we found that if the mortal\n-\nity increase lasts the entire simulation period (200\u00a0years), then NEP remains negative during the entire period (Fig.\u00a0 11a). In contrast, when elevated mortality was a tem\n-\nporary phenomenon (50 or 100\u00a0years), then the period of negative NEP was followed by a positive period as the for\n-\nest landscape recovered. Regardless of the duration of ele -\nvated mortality, the timing was strongly influenced by the \nFig. 10 Effect of log:snag decomposition rate-constant ratio and \ntiming of complete snag fall on the amount of carbon in CWD caused \nby a disturbance left after 100 years in the case in which snags k is higher than that of logs\nFig. 11 Hypothetical responses of net ecosystem production (NEP) to increases in mortality as mediated by CWD decomposition.

Carbon Balance Manage            (2020) 15:1 \ndecomposition rate-constant: forests with higher decom -\nposition rate-constants responded faster than those with \nlower ones. As might be expected, the magnitude of the mortality increase influenced the magnitude of the NEP response; however, the decomposition rate-constant con\n-\ntrolled the timing of the response (Fig.\u00a0 11b). Specifically, \nthe most negative value of NEP was reached first by the forest with the fastest decomposition. It also approached zero (i.e., carbon balance) earliest, although in no case was a NEP of zero actually reached, suggesting that the impacts of increased tree mortality could last centu\n-\nries in many boreal and temperate forests. The response of decomposition to mortality had a major impact on temporal changes in NEP (Fig.\u00a0 11c). If, on one hand, the \ndecomposition rate-constant decreased because, for example, standing dead CWD was created or open condi\n-\ntions reduced decomposition rates (in this case by 20%), then the initial response to increased mortality would be a positive increase in NEP at least until conditions favoring decomposition return. Once decomposition resumed its initial rate-constant value, NEP would become more neg\n-\native than when decomposition rate-constants remained constant. If, on the other hand the decomposition rate-constant increased by a similar amount as mortality (20%), the NEP response would be more complex. Specifi\n-\ncally, at first it was more negative than when decomposi -\ntion rate-constants remained constant. This was followed by a period in which it was less negative, due to the fact that CWD was re-accumulating following the period of elevated decomposition. Changes in decomposition could interact with changes in NPP as well (Fig.\u00a0 11d). If NPP \nalso decreased temporarily (in this case by 20%) due to increased mortality (perhaps due to lags in tree regenera\n-\ntion), then NEP became much more negative than when NPP remained constant. Interestingly, if decomposi\n-\ntion rate-constants also decreased over the same period, then these net carbon losses were somewhat mitigated as decomposition-related losses reduced.\nOur model of carbon balance, while lacking detailed \nmechanisms, does include the range of changes in mor\n-\ntality, NPP , and decomposition that can be anticipated. Our overall conclusion from these preliminary modeling experiments is that while the magnitude and duration of elevated mortality will be important in controlling future forest carbon balances, the response of CWD decomposi\n-\ntion to increased mortality will be equally critical as it is a major determinant of the carbon balance (i.e., magnitude and timing of net carbon loss) of forested ecosystems. In particular, if disturbance influences the rate-constant of decomposition (i.e., k) then the response of carbon bal\n-\nance would be quite complex.Modeling approaches\nOur intention was not to conduct a detailed, exhaustive review and evaluation of how models consider the pro\n-\ncess of CWD decomposition; therefore below we exam -\nine a range of examples using general aspects of their structure to assess the degree to which they would poten\n-\ntially mimic the CWD carbon dynamics and balance as identified via our study of CWD decomposition. These examples were selected from models that are currently used in high-level scientific exercises and/or carbon accounting, assuming that these examples represent the status quo of carbon modelling in the respective areas.\nHow models have been used\nUnder the Kyoto Protocol, forest models have been used to estimate the Forest Management Reference Levels to be used in the second commitment period. Under cur\n-\nrent EU legislation a \u201cForest Reference Level\u201d is to be used in the EU member states for accounting purposes in the period 2021\u20132030. Models used by the Euro\n-\npean Commission and a large number of member states include, among others, EFISCEN (European Forest Infor\n-\nmation Scenario model), GLOBIOM (Global Biosphere Management Model), G4M (Global Forest Model), CBM-CFS3 (Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Ser\n-\nvice), EFDM (European Forestry Dynamics Model), FVS (Forest Vegetation Simulator), and YASSO (please see [80] and [81] for details).\nReview of\u00a0model examples\nThe models could be sorted into three groups: (1) forest models usually used to specifically simulate forest devel\n-\nopment including management, (2) vegetation or land use models (e.g., Dynamic Global Vegetation Models), and (3) soil models, sometimes run as part of a larger framework or as a module within another model (Addi\n-\ntional file\u00a01: Table S-2).\nAccording to the documentation available, of the mod -\nels recommended for use in the EU [81], two (G4M and GLOBIOM) did not specifically include CWD decom\n-\nposition and two (EFDM and EFISCEN) referred to the soil model YASSO to simulate this process. The latter contains five soil organic components three of which (i.e., extractives, celluloses, and lignin-like compounds) receive inputs from fine and coarse woody litters. This method is used to model the course of both woody and non-woody litter decomposition [82]. The decomposition rates of the YASSO compartments are adjusted by air temperature and precipitation. However, by aggregating all tree species this model cannot address changes in tree species composition or size structure if they differ from Page 16 of 21 Harmon\u00a0et\u00a0al. Carbon Balance Manage            (2020) 15:1 \nthe parameterization at the beginning of the simulation. \nMoreover, it cannot address changes in the dominance of dead tree positions that different kinds of disturbances could create. In contrast, CBM-CFS3 [83], also recom\n-\nmended in the EU, allows for a more detailed simulation of both standing and downed FWD and CWD that are separated into hardwood and softwood classes, but not by tree species per se; although this could in theory be addressed to some degree by ecosystem-specific adjust\n-\nment factors. According to the documentation available, FVS [84, 85] separates standing and downed CWD. Its \nstructure offers the most potential to adjust decomposi\n-\ntion rates of various dead matter pools because, at least for living pools, it tracks pools by species and by size.\nFor most of the models used in ISIMIP , no detailed \ninformation about the treatment of decomposition could be consistently derived from the documentation provided by the modelers. Where such information could be iden\n-\ntified, dead wood was usually treated as a form of litter or directly added to a \u201clabile\u201d soil carbon pool. Decom\n-\nposition was typically tracked in 2\u20134 soil carbon pools with different turnover rates and transfer rates between these pools. Exceptions are LPJ-GUESS (\u201cLund Potsdam Jena General Ecosystem Simulator\u201d) with 11 soil organic material compartments that include CWD and FWD [86] and 4C (\u201cFORESEE\u2014FORest Ecosystems in a Changing Environment\u201d) [87], whose soil module contains five soil depths, including a humus layers that includes all forms of litter including CWD. LPJ-GUESS and other models do not distinguish tree species, but include \u201cplant func\n-\ntional types\u201d . Given the wide variation of k within even the same tree genus, this approach may not fully capture CWD decomposition, especially if disturbances affect dif\n-\nferent trees species to different magnitudes hence change the mixture of species in the dead wood pool. These models also do not include the effects of size or position on CWD decomposition and could not be used to assess the impact of how disturbance influences these factors. Models that used several pools with different transfer rates varied these decomposition rates due to soil mois\n-\nture, temperature, and, in three models, nitrogen avail -\nability, or pH (4C). Thus, they included some of the influences identified in our analysis, but their approach of using a single cascade of pools aggregated by species, size, and position would be very susceptible to weighing bias and errors, if and when the composition of dead wood input changed over time. We are aware that incorporat\n-\ning all factors presented in our analysis in decomposition modelling at a global level is not practicable (especially species-related effects or microclimatic factors like stand openness), but we caution that changes in tree species composition, tree size, and the position of dead trees will have influences on the future carbon release from dead wood pools and should be considered in future analyses and interpretations of modelling results.\nFuture directions of\u00a0dead wood decomposition research\nEntering a\u00a0new phase of\u00a0research\nRemarkable progress has been made in the last few dec -\nades in estimating the decomposition rates of CWD and \nidentifying some of the major controlling factors. The first estimates in our compiled database dates from 1970 with the majority appearing after 1990. This early phase of CWD decomposition science might be described as largely opportunistic and observational. That is, these studies largely took advantage of existing situations to make preliminary estimates of this process, often with sample sizes < 10 (we acknowledge there are some nota\n-\nble exceptions). Although we expect that additional esti -\nmates of this nature will continue to accumulate in the future, we believe that sufficient information exists to envision a new phase of this science which could be more systematic, experimental, and replicated.\nMethodological approaches\nAs noted above, the majority of estimates have come from chronosequences. This makes perfect sense in that the decomposition of individual CWD pieces can take many human lifetimes. We expect that this approach will be used in the future; however, it does have major limitations that need to be considered. First, the initial condition (i.e., position, size, density, and presence of previous decay) of the pieces can be difficult to deter\n-\nmine, particularly when decomposition is extensive. This makes determination of mass and volume loss very chal\n-\nlenging. At best one can approximate initial volume and mass which unfortunately introduces uncertainty into decomposition rate estimates. At worst, use of remain\n-\ning density without adjusting for volume loss can bias decomposition rates downward [88]. To gain additional insights into CWD decomposition dynamics, it would be helpful if changes in volume, density, and mass were examined and reported. Some of the difficulty in deter\n-\nmining the effect of size in chronosequences is that sometimes there are high levels of uncertainty regarding the initial size. Second, by substituting space for time the environment can differ not only in space, but also in time: that is the environment in the near past might be differ\n-\nent than the far past even in the same place. The third is that one has to sample the pieces that exist and this makes controlling factors and experimental designs dif\n-\nficult. Many of these problems can be overcome by the use of time series. However, this brings one back to the challenge of conducting experiments and observations over multiple human lifetimes. We believe that in limited cases it worth the effort to create high resolution time Page 17 of 21\n Harmon\u00a0et\u00a0al. Carbon Balance Manage            (2020) 15:1 \nseries studies (see [35, 89]); however, it is hard to envi -\nsion this as the main approach employed in the future. \nPerhaps the best practical compromise would be to use the decomposition vector method in which a range of decay stages are observed over a relatively short period of time (i.e., 5\u201310\u00a0 years). This approach shortens the time required for study, examines actual temporal changes, and allows one to examine whether decomposition rates themselves are a function of decay state. The latter would be extremely helpful in coupling to large scale invento\n-\nries of CWD, which usually identify the decay class/stage. This coupling would allow one to estimate CWD decom\n-\nposition losses for very broad regions, something that decomposition studies of individual pieces are challenged to do because they depend on knowledge of species and decay state mixtures and not just the differences among these groupings. Broad scale inventories could also assist decomposition science. Given the small sample sizes involved in decomposition estimates, robust estimates of the residence time in decay classes are rarely provided in decomposition studies. Broad scale inventories, particu\n-\nlarly using revisited pieces [43], could provide the large numbers required to provide robust estimates of decay class residence times that would help decomposition vector studies (e.g., [44, 90]). Broad scale inventories can \nalso provide robust estimates of standing dead fall rates [91]. Regardless of how well standing versus downed CWD decomposition rates are quantified, it cannot be fully taken advantage of until the rate of transfer between these two forms of CWD is better quantified.\nWhile we have examined CWD as an aggregated black \nbox using the rate-constant of decomposition (k) as the key variable, CWD is not a homogeneous substrate and external losses are not the only processes involved dur\n-\ning decomposition. Examination of tissues within CWD and how these are transformed by decomposers would help explain species and size effects as well as non-linear changes in how CWD pieces decompose over time. For example, the degree to which the presence of white- ver\n-\nsus brown-rots in CWD [92\u201394] influences the decom -\nposition process needs to be better explored given that decomposition by brown rot can result in a substantial amount of lignin-rich residual material entering the \u201csoil\u201d pool [95]. Hence, the inability of brown-rots to signifi\n-\ncantly degrade lignin would form the mechanistic basis of asymptotic decomposition models. Finally, a better understanding of the pathways by which carbon leaves CWD needs to be gained. As [33] point out, it cannot be assumed that all losses in CWD mass are a direct result of respiration. However, that does not mean that frag\n-\nmented or leached carbon is not respired; understand -\ning the situations in which fragmentation and leaching decreases versus increases respirational losses are critical to fully understanding how increased mortality influ\n-\nences atmospheric carbon.\nImproving experiments\nExperimental manipulation of CWD [e.g., 35, 62, 89] \nis challenging given its size and expense. However, we believe that experimental designs could be substantially improved in the next phase of this science. The effect of tree species could be better understood if a wider range of species were examined, with more attention paid to examining species with the full range of decay resist\n-\nance at a site. This would allow one to confirm that decay resistant genera respond less to climate than those with limited decay resistance. As a whole, species in the fam\n-\nily Cupressaceae would be a logical starting point for genera with high decay resistance that span a wide range of biomes from boreal (Thuja ) to subtropical (Cunning\n-\nhamia  and Taxodium ) to woodlands (Juniperius ). One \ncould also take advantage of genera such as Robinia  that \nhave been planted widely and would offer a highly decay resistant species for comparison. The effects of size, as indicated by diameter and length, could be better under\n-\nstood if a wider range of sizes and conditions was exam -\nined. In this regard, it would make sense to combine studies of fine woody detritus (FWD) with CWD because size effects are most pronounced in smaller sized pieces. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that there is no sin\n-\ngle size effect, rather it differs with canopy openness, the overall climate, and CWD position. This suggests that far more combinations of conditions have to be examined to unravel this complexity. Fortunately FWD is much more amenable to experimental manipulation and this may make experiments that compare positions or effects of canopy openness more common in the future. Posi\n-\ntion effect experiments for CWD may be difficult to con -\nduct given the danger and difficulty in creating standing dead trees. In this case it may be more practical to find situations in which standing dead trees have been created (e.g., wildfires or insect outbreaks) and then fell subsets of these trees to create the downed CWD for compari\n-\nson. In addition, these felled trees can provide estimates of the standing CWD initial condition.\nDetermining climatic effects\nDetermining the effect of climatic factors on CWD decomposition has been challenging. While it may be possible to manipulate the amount of moisture or tem\n-\nperature, the most expedient approach may be to examine genera that grow under wide temperature and precipita\n-\ntion ranges. Tropical forests remain understudied relative to boreal and temperate ones (Fig.\u00a0 2). Increasing infor\n-\nmation for tropical forests will be important for several Page 18 of 21 Harmon\u00a0et\u00a0al. Carbon Balance Manage            (2020) 15:1 \nreasons: (1) they represent the upper limit of tempera -\ntures for forests, (2) have a diverse tree taxa that is gener -\nally distinct from the ones in boreal and temperate forests, \nand (3) have higher macroinvertebrate decomposer abun -\ndance than their boreal and temperate counterparts. The range of climates that has been examined is quite wide; however, more attention to warmer, drier conditions (e.g., typical of woodlands) and warmer, wetter ones (e.g., sub\n-\ntropical) would reveal more about climatic controls and their interaction with other factors such as position. We found two genera, Betula and Pinus , that could prove \nuseful and others with wide climatic ranges such as Pop\n-\nulus, could be targeted. Given the interaction between \ndecay resistance and climate, care needs to be taken to assure that the former is controlled. This is not an issue for genera lacking heartwood decay resistance (e.g., Abies, \nBetula, and Populus), but can be problematical for those with even moderate decay resistance in heartwood if the proportion of heartwood in stems varies within a genus (e.g., Pinus ). To circumvent this problem, it may be neces\n-\nsary to separate sapwood and heartwood decomposition for genera of the latter type.\nIn addition to an improved experimental design \nregarding climate, more attention needs to be placed on finding more meaningful climatic indices. While MAT is often used, it might not be as insightful as indices that include seasonal effects and periods of peak biological activity such as degree-days. Although total precipita\n-\ntion approximates the effects of moisture, examining the effect of either the seasonality of precipitation or a more direct index of moisture would likely provide more mechanistic insights on climatic controls as well as inter\n-\nactions related to size, position, and canopy openness. It also has to be recognized that moisture is not necessarily a \u201cfixed\u201d site property in that disturbances can make sites effectively drier or wetter depending on the ecosystem.\nModeling CWD decomposition\nModeling of CWD decomposition occurs at several levels. Modeling decomposition losses at the level of individual trees has largely been based on the single negative expo\n-\nnential model. If data on for separate tissues or layers were available, a multiple negative exponential model could be employed with the benefit of predicting non-linear trends [27]. Non-linear trends could also be predicted using \nmodels with temporal lags [34], but precisely fitting these would depend on data with higher temporal resolution early in the decomposition process than has generally been available. The opposite problem occurs for asymptotic models: greater temporal resolution of the latter stages of decomposition is required to determine the asymptote.\nOur analysis of the time course of carbon release indi\n-\ncates that the way CWD decomposition is modeled at higher levels may have to be reconsidered if underly -\ning driving factors and the complexities of the tempo -\nral pattern of carbon release and carbon balance is to be captured (see Fig.\u00a0 11 for examples). First, many global \nmodels predict CWD decomposition using lignin, cel\n-\nlulose, and other organic fractions (often only separated in two or three pools of different \u201cdecay resistance\u201d); however, very few of the empirical studies we examined explain their results using these factors. Instead, factors such as species, decay resistance as related to extrac\n-\ntives, size, position, and microenvironment were used. This implies a fundamental disconnect between models and empirical studies that needs to be addressed. Sec\n-\nond, while one may need to aggregate as much as pos -\nsible when modeling, this has to be done in a manner that allows the overall decomposition rate-constant to evolve over time. Aggregating species with markedly different decomposition rate-constants, which can differ at some sites by at least an order of magnitude, can lead to sys\n-\ntematic overestimation of fluxes immediately after dis -\nturbance and underestimation later (Fig.\u00a0 7). Moreover, \nto capture the response to climate one might also have to consider the effect of species. Our analysis and that of others (e.g., [73]) suggest that species with high decay resistance respond less to changes in MAT than those with lower decay resistance; hence the \u201caverage\u201d temper\n-\nature response at a site depends on the species mixture. In addition, the species mixture can change over time in response to a warming climate and one cannot assume that the decay resistance of the replacement species will be the same as the original ones. Given that it can take decades to centuries for CWD to decompose, these leg\n-\nacy effects could influence carbon dynamics for a consid -\nerable time.\nIn regions in which standing and downed CWD have \nsubstantially different (an order of magnitude or more) decomposition rate-constants, using an aggregated aver\n-\nage can entirely miss the non-linear nature of the decom -\nposition related flux. While the degree to which these aggregation errors express themselves is likely dependent on the system being studied as well as the scale, it cannot be routinely assumed that decomposition rate-constants and their related fluxes are static proportions over time. Future modeling needs to address these issues, but future decomposition studies also need to provide a stronger basis for aggregated modeling systems by reporting non-aggregated values to the extent possible.\nConclusions\nWe examined estimates of CWD decomposition rates collected over the past \u2248 50\u00a0 years around the world to \ndetermine the effects of species, size, position, can\n-\nopy openness, and climate. Based on the 295 estimates Page 19 of 21\n Harmon\u00a0et\u00a0al. Carbon Balance Manage            (2020) 15:1 \ncompiled, we found strong evidence that each factor had \nan influence with their combined effect leading to orders of magnitude differences in the decomposition rate-con\n-\nstant implying a lifespan of CWD as short as 3\u00a0years and as long as at least 750\u00a0 years. The effects of differences related to species and position (and likely size) can lead the aggregated decomposition rate-constant to evolve over time resulting in non-linear temporal patterns of carbon release. This indicates that while consider\n-\nable progress in understanding the release of carbon via CWD decomposition has been made, a more systematic, experimental, and replicated approach is warranted if the impact of increased tree mortality are to be fully under\n-\nstood and anticipated in regards to C cycling and broader ecosystem functions.\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary information accompanies this paper at https ://doi.\norg/10.1186/s1302 1-019-0136-6.\nAdditional file\u00a01.
