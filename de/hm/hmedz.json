Repeated listening once or twice a day for 2-3 weeks ensures maximum impact. A separate track of affirmations shows how to relax in a briefer format, with positive statements designed for listening on the go or even while driving. Written and narrated by noted mind-body, holistic health pioneer Belleruth Naparstek and scored to the immersive music of Steven Mark Kohn, this Health Journeys relaxation meditation was produced by the Cleveland Orchestra's Bruce Gigax. The track list is as follows: 1. Introduction (2:34) 2. Guided Imagery (16:28) 3. Affirmations (19:03) The images on this relaxation meditation audio heighten feelings of love and safety, pump up serotonin and promote a state of energized calm. It should be also noted that this very meditation for relaxation and wellness is the first half of a research-proven imagery protocol used by veterans suffering from persistent posttraumatic stress, and yielded dramatic outcomes for survivors of combat and military sexual trauma (the second half of the protocol was our Healing Trauma imagery). Listen to a sample and see why this meditation CD for relaxation& wellness is one of our most popular titles, recommended robustly through word of mouth and by health care professionals and mental health counselors nationwide.
