In 1997, he received the shared Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of the \u201csodium-potassium pump\u201d, together with John Ernest Walker and Paul Delos Boye. All three scientists worked on the molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the most important energy carrier within cells.\nJens Christina Skou's primary research was on the breakdown of ATP. He discovered the transport enzyme sodium-potassium-ATPase (Na+/K+-ATPase), which transports substances through the cell membrane and uses up ATP in the process. There is a concentration gradient between the cell interior and the exterior, which is necessary for many processes in the cell. However, sodium ions are constantly diffusing into the cell interior, which would lead to a voltage balance between the cell interior and the exterior in the long run. However, if the voltage between the inside and the outside were the same, the transmission of an electrical stimulus would be impossible. The sodium-potassium pump maintains the concentration gradient between the inside and the outside. The enzyme (Na+/K+-ATPase) enables the transport of three positively charged sodium ions out of the cell and two positively charged potassium ions into the cell, thus ensuring the differential distribution. ATP is broken down into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate in this process.\nJens Christian Skou isolated the enzyme from the nerve cell membranes of crustaceans. With his research, he clarified the basics of this enzyme mechanism. The mechanism is important for maintaining cell volume and plays a role in controlling the heartbeat. Defects of the sodium-potassium pump could be a possible cause of epilepsy.", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["/en/leopoldina-home/", "javascript:void(0);",
