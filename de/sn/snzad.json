{"title": "Chiropractic", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Of all forms of alternative medicine, chiropractic is the one that is most generally accepted. In the UK, for instance, chiropractors are regulated by statute and even have their own 'Royal College of Chiropractic'. In the US, chiropractic's country of origin, most chiropractors carry the title 'doctor' and many consumers believe they are medically trained.Despite this high level of acceptance, chiropractic is wide open to criticism. The claims and assumptions made by chiropractors are far from evidence based. Chiropractic manipulations are of doubtful effectiveness and have regularly been associated with severe adverse effects, including multiple fatalities. The advice issued by chiropractors to patients and consumers is often less than responsible. The behaviour of chiropractors and their organisations is frequently less than professional.This book presents and discusses recent evidence in and around chiropractic in a factual and unemotional manner. It amounts to an evidence-based critique of this profession and discloses the often dangerously misleading information published for the lay audience. It thereby contributes to advancing public health and critical thinking.<br/><br/>The History of Chiropractic.- Popularity and Acceptance.- The Main Axiom of Chiropractic: Subluxation and Spinal Manipulation.- Other Modalities Used by Chiropractors.- Offshoots of Chiropractic.- Therapeutic Claims by Chiropractors.- Effectiveness of Spinal Manipulation.- Safety of Spinal Manipulation.- Education and Professionalism.- Ethical and Legal Issues.- Other Issues.- The Tricks of the Trade.- Glossary.", "sitename": null, "date": "2020-01-01", "id": null, "license": null, "body": null, "comments": "", "commentsbody": null, "raw_text": null, "text": "[Ernst, Edzard](/search?q=Ernst%2C%20Edzard)ChiropracticNot All That It's Cracked Up to Be\nKartoniert, 1st ed. 2020,\n[Springer, Berlin](/search?q=Verlag%3A%27Springer%2C%20Berlin%27)(2020)\n32,99 \u20ac\ninkl.
