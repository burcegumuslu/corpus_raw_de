Thereby we can conclude that personalized medicine can be value for money and represents a key op- portunity for improving efficiency in healthcare provision and drug devel- opment. However, the impact of ex- isting evidence on reimbursement has shown to be very small. FDA approved tests have little clinical evidence and vice versa, evidence-based tests have not resulted in approval [2]. As it ap- pears, professional society guidelines have a far stronger influence on re- imbursement than evidence, because they take into account current practice patterns [2]; only judgement of the evidence's strength is included [2]. Conclusion Amongst other reasons, the lack of strong clinical evidence in form of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) can be responsible for low levels of reim- bursement of personalized medicine [2]. In this sense, the industry can only be encouraged to promote clinical trials of personalized medicine tech- nologies in order to ensure its ac- knowledgment by reimbursement au- thorities. On the other hand, current reimbursement systems will be challenged in the future due to the increase of technologies requiring re- imbursement assessment. Reimburse- ment processes might need to become not only more flexible but also act more rapidly. Despite of the complexity of per- sonalized medicine, its lack of evidence and its demand of health system adaption, personalized medicine rep- resents a most interesting pharma- ceutical development also due to its great potential of creating multiple \u201cwin-win-situations\u201d, for patients, for providers, for the industry, and last but not least, for payers. Not only has personalized medicine shown im- portant benefits, it has demonstrated substantial value which merits further pursuit. | Literature [1] Hamburg, M.A. and Collins F.S., The Path to Personalized Medicine, Perspective, New England Journal of Medicine, July 2010 [2] Meckley L.M., Neumann P.J, Personaliized Med- icine: Factors influencing reimbursement, Health Policy, 2010 [3] Jackson, D.B. and Sood, A., Personalized Cancer Medicine \u2013 Advances and Socio-economic Challenges, Nature, Volume 8, December 2011 [4] Tahan, V. et al, Is HCV Genotyping Cost-Effective Even When the Prevalences of Genotypes 2 and 3 Are Low?, Hepato-Gastroenterology 5, 2009 [5] Carlson J.J., The Potential Clinical and Economic Outcomes of Pharmacogenomic Approaches to EGFR-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy in Non\u2013 Small-Cell Lung Cancer, Value in Health, Volume 12, 2009 [6] Blank P. et al, KRAS and BRAF mutation analysis in metastatic colorectal cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis from a Swiss perspective, Clinical Cancer Research, 2011 [7] Blank, P. et al, Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Expression in Early Breast Cancer Patients: A Swiss Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Different Predictive Assay Strategies, Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, 2010 AUTHORS Thomas D.
