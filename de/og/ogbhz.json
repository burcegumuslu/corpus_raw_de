A model \u20183WQF80-10\u2019 single-rotor diesel UAV was tested using this method in wheat field and the effects of flight direction, flight parameters and crosswind on the distribution of spatial spraying deposition quality balance (SSDQB) and the downwash flow field distribution were researched. A cuboid aluminum sampling frame of spatial spraying deposition quality balance (SFSSDQB) with monofilament wires was made for collecting the droplets in four directions, and a set of multi-channel micro-meteorology measurement system (MMMS) was applied for measuring the downwash wind speed in three directions. Besides, BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BNSS) was used for controlling and recording the working height, velocity and track of this model of single-rotor UAV. The results showed the distribution of the spatial spray deposition and the downwash flow field of UAV could be measured effectively at exact flight height and velocity via this method. When the average wind speed was 0.9 m/s, the average temperature was 31.5\u00b0C and the average relative humidity was 34.1%, and the average distribution ratios of spraying deposition for model \u20183WQF80-10\u2019 UAV on the upwind part, the top part, the downwind part and the bottom part were 4.4%, 2.3%, 50.4% and 43.7%, respectively. The flight directions of forward and backward had an impact on droplet deposition distribution and the working effect of flying backwards, with 60% of deposition ratio of the bottom part of the SFSSDQB, was better than flying forward. There was a linear negative correlation between the coefficient of variation (CV) of the bottom part and the flight height and the coefficient of determination was 0.9178, which means that the deposition distribution becomes more uniform with the increase of height. Additionally, there was a linear positive correlation between weighted mean deposition rate and crosswind speed and the coefficient of determination was 0.9684, which shows the deposition distribution gets more concentrated towards the downwind part with the rise of crosswind speed. Therefore, according to the results of tests of downwash airflow speed, it is shown that regardless of the flight direction and height and the crosswind, all these factors influence the droplet deposition distribution via weakening the intensity of the downwash airflow field in the direction perpendicular to the ground.
