After all, they have \"scientific\" meetings (in Teheran).\nPosted by: Thomas Xavier | December 2, 2008 8:50 AM\n----------------------------------------------\nI mostly agree, but I'd find it a bit tough to just kick out those guys. A nicer solution can be considered. A new platform should be created, named not ScienceBlogs but PseudoScienceBlogs. And they should be automatically transferred to it. Now, how Seed could be convinced to sponsor such a move, I'm not quite sure. But it should be possible, as it currently has no problem hosting the guys.\nPosted by: Christophe Thill | December 2, 2008 9:40 AM\n----------------------------------------------\nThanks for pointing out, that neurological differences shouldn't be called \"brain damage\"\nFYI, Artmann called psychiatric wards \"nuthouses\".\nI'm amazed, that the German science community doesn't find that at all offensive.\nPosted by: The Gonzo Girl | December 2, 2008 9:53 AM\n----------------------------------------------\n...Peter Artmann, who is clearly arguing for dangerous quackery by telling his readers that heavy metal in their Ayurvedic herbal remedies is not harmful, as long as an Ayurvedic healer directs their use. People could suffer heavy metal poisoning as a result of following such advice...\nBut people have suffered heavy metal poisoning as a result of such advice, as I mentioned in an entry I wrote about this yesterday. So-called \"folk medicines,\" including the Ayurvedic hoodoo, has been implicated in literally thousands of heavy metal poisonings in the US. More about that here, but just a snippet:\nTraditional medicines may account for up to 30 percent of all childhood lead poisoning cases in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates 240,000 U.S. children were diagnosed with high blood lead levels in 2004 to 2006.\nMany more cases are almost certainly going undetected. Only 14 percent of children are tested for lead nationwide...\nThat these sorts of things should find a pulpit on ScienceBlogs.de is unconscionable, and whomever made the decision to allow them on there should no longer have the responsibility of making such decisions at all.\nPosted by: Mike O'Risal | December 2, 2008 9:56 AM\n----------------------------------------------\n\"Note also how Ehgartner refers to the changes in the brain that this study found in boys with ADHD as \"brain damage.\" I don't know if that's a mistranslation or not, but it sure doesn't sound good.\"\nThe german word he used was \"Hirnsch\u00e4digungen\" which indeed translates \"brain damage\".\nPosted by: florian | December 2, 2008 9:57 AM\n----------------------------------------------\nEventually something will have to be done about this, preferably involving testing Ayruvedic remedies on german science bloggers....\nFor now I think the best option for now is just to encourage german readers to keep an eye on them, so we can baet them around the head with The Big Stick Of Science (patent pending) when ever they say something dumb.\nAnyone got info on Jessice Ricco?

In the case of Peter Artmann, it is about a ScienceBlogger who defends obvious quackery and makes utterly unscientific assertions while doing so. I don't know about my fellow ScienceBloggers, be they English- or German-speaking, but I don't like being associated with two such bloggers. I don't like it at all.

Until now we have 443 measles cases in 2008 all originated from unvaccinated students in an anhroposophic Steiner school. Total america had 165 cases in 2007.\nAnd here is another piece of Bert Ehgartner- he posted it in the guest book of an anti-vaccine group around 2005.\nTranslation: In life unfortunately not all things are black or white. I repeat my arguments to mesales. Measles today has nearly nothing to do with the disease measles 20 yrs ago. Caused by immunizations measles appears more frequently in age groups, where the complication rate is significantly increased: In children below 12 month (because immunized mothers give less protection to their babys) in adolescents and in adults. So the measles immunization has caused that a harmless childrens disesae- when good care is given- has changed to a disease with frequent complications. Instead of contributing to the maturation of the immune system of the child and of contributing to the psychic development in toodlers age, the disease is weaker due to immunization, hardly has a positive effect on the immune system and carrys the risk of chronic gut disease, and the causation of severe autoimmundiseases\nand here the original text in German\nAber im Leben ist leider nicht alles nur schwarz oder nur wei\u00df. Ich wiederhole nochmal meine Argumentation zur Masern: Masern heute hat mit der Krankheit Masern vor 20 Jahren fast nichts mehr gemeinsam. Durch die Impfkampagnen tritt Masern heute vermehrt in Altersgruppen auf, wo die Komplikationsrate wesentlich erh\u00f6ht ist: Bei Kindern unter 12 Monaten (weil geimpfte M\u00fctter ihren Babys weniger Schutz weitergeben), sowie bei Jugendlichen und Erwachsenen. Damit hat die Masernimpfung aus einer - bei guter Pflege - harmlosen Kinderkrankheit eine komplikationsreiche Krankheit gemacht. Anstatt zur Reifung des kindlichen Immunsystem und zur psychischen Entwicklung im Vorschulalter beizutragen, verl\u00e4uft die Masern in folge der Impfung abgeschw\u00e4cht, hat kaum einen positiven Effekt auf das Immunsystem und birgt das Risiko chronischer Darmentz\u00fcndungen, sowie die Ausl\u00f6sung schwerer Autoimmunerkrankungen (z.B: Autismus).\nin summary this is dangerous bullshit.\nPosted by: wolfgang | December 2, 2008 11:24 AM\n----------------------------------------------\nDie dummen Br\u00e4nde hell\nPosted by: Tsu Dho Nimh | December 2, 2008 11:33 AM\n----------------------------------------------\nAs a fellow ScienceBlogs.de blogger, I have followed these discussions (here and over at ScienceBlogs.de) for a few days now. Since I am a computer scientist, who knows jack about medicine, I generally do not blog about medical issues or feel compelled to discuss them.\nHowever, it seems very odd to me, that you would actually link someone who writes an article about aluminum in vaccines - no matter how wrong this article may be - to a Holocaust denier. This is an ad hominem argument so unjust, it makes the Ehrgartner article look much better than it actually is. To compare people with scientificly questionable views (antivax, homeopathy etc.) to actual hate groups such as Holocaust deniers, is certainly not the kind of response you would expect in an academic discussion.\nFurthermore, I fail to understand why none of the people who are obviously very agitated by Ehrgartners arguments would bother to just compile a bunch of links to scientific, peer-reviewed studies, that devalidate his claims. Instead of comparing Ehrgartner to a Holocaust denier and demanding that every blogger, who makes an antivax statement be fired from ScienceBlogs, would it not be a much more proper and more scientific way to refute his claims using scientific references?\n\"An angry man opens his mouth and shuts his eyes.\"\n- Marcus Porcius Cato\nPosted by: Christian | December 2, 2008 11:33 AM\n----------------------------------------------\nI would love to offer myself up to scienceblogs to write about the value of the four humors theory of medicine.\nIt is a long established, traditional medical \"theory\" with a long history of successful treatment (in that practitioners had a history of being paid for their services) until it was supplanted by evidence based medicine.\nSince there are a handful of diseases, disorders, injuries and poisonings for which bleeding and emesis are actually called for by evidence based medicine, all of the four humor's treatments must be valid, and if you disagree, then you just haven't been bled by the right person.\nI demand to be heard, even if I don't believe in what I would be writing.\n[Yes, that was sarcasm]\nPosted by: Robster, FCD | December 2, 2008 11:37 AM\n----------------------------------------------\nTo be honest, I think this was always going to be the problem with this kind of blogging project. As soon as you allow a single popular magazine to become the hub of science blogging, you end up subject to their whims.\nRealistically, the best thing you can do I think is to get someone at Seed onside, or just club together with some colleagues and threaten to walk.\nPosted by: Martin | December 2, 2008 11:40 AM\n----------------------------------------------\nJepp Florian, I'm with you. Particularly the statement from Jessica was really disappointing and disturbing. I mean, why the hell do we waste precious time to battle anti-science, quackery and scientific misinformation on Scienceblogs.de, again? Not only do have we at least one person sprouting the worst sort of nonsense under the disguise of science right within our midst, the editor also defends him on the basis of his \"outstanding\" and shining past accomplishments as science writer for the news paper.\nI couldn't care less. Bullshit is bullshit and still smells of shit, no matter who excretes it.\nI'm tired and I'm frustrated and I'm seriously considering quitting altogether. If anti-science is not only invited but actually defended with very dubious arguments, then Scienceblogs.de is already rotten to the core. And that in the first year of its launch.\nBTW. Scienceblogs.de is maintained by Burda media not SEED. A large german publishing company.\nPosted by: Ludmila | December 2, 2008 11:46 AM\n----------------------------------------------\nChristian, to find the arguments you are looking for, see Orac's blog. Heck, a google of scienceblogs.com and vaccination will do. Seriously. Orac has deconstructed this particular nonsense time and time again, with extensive references. It's Ehgartner who hasn't done his homework.\nperceval, a fellow computer scientist\n----------------------------------------------\nPosted by: perceval | December 2, 2008 11:49 AM\n@Christian\nmay I correct you: Bert Ehgartner ist not at all a holocaust denier. He undersigned the rethinkers, who claim that HIV is not the cause of AIDS.\nPosted by: wolfgang | December 2, 2008 11:49 AM\n----------------------------------------------\nChristian, the use of \"denial\" and \"denialist\" are partly due to the clumsy English language.\nHIV denial is referred to as such because proponents deny the evidence that HIV is the cause of AIDS. We have yet to come up with a word that is more appropriate without being crudely vulgar.\nAlso, the peer reviewed evidence is known to many of us, and is present in many of Orac's links. I'd love to put a few together, but I am supposed to be grading lab reports, but am an extraordinary procrastinator, and am doing what I do best.\nPosted by: Robster, FCD | December 2, 2008 11:50 AM\n----------------------------------------------\n[https://twitter.com/Scienceblogs/status/1034440130](https://twitter.com/Scienceblogs/status/1034440130)\nPosted by: Tobias | December 2, 2008 11:51 AM\n----------------------------------------------\nJepp Florian, I'm with you.

To compare people with scientificly questionable views (antivax, homeopathy etc.) to actual hate groups such as Holocaust deniers, is certainly not the kind of response you would expect in an academic discussion.\nYou misunderstand.\nThe comparison to Holocaust denial is not meant to call Ehgartner a Nazi. It is to point out that he uses the same sorts of logical fallacies, misrepresentations of evidence and science, and dubious assertions to make his case as Holocaust deniers do. Holocaust deniers. In this I consider Holocaust deniers to be of a type with other types of pseudoscience, including creationism, quackery, paranormal phenomena, etc. It is not calling anyone a Nazi or anti-Semite; it is pointing out commonalities among cranks.\nIn case you doubt my blogging credentials on this, note that I have a long history of speaking out against Holocaust denial, and I daresay that I probably know more about Holocaust denial than you do:\n[http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/history/holocaust_denial](http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/history/holocaust_denial)\nGiven that history, I am well aware of how toxic the term can be and have in the past urged caution in using it:\n[http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/denialism_sometimes_theres_no_other_way.php](http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/denialism_sometimes_theres_no_other_way.php)\nHowever, that being said, we should not shy away from lumping this very pernicious form of denialism in with other forms of denialism when appropriate just because of its connotation of anti-Semitism and Hitler apologia, either. It fits. Indeed, Michael Shermer did just that in his book Why People Believe Weird Things:\n[http://skepdic.com/refuge/weird.html](http://skepdic.com/refuge/weird.html)\nI view Holocaust denial as being the same as a lot of other pseudoscience, including creationism, quackery, various forms of paranormal pseudoscience, etc., in that it uses the same sorts of fallacious and pseudoscientific arguments, nothing more. Substitute the word \"creationist\" if you like.\nPosted by: Orac | December 2, 2008 11:54 AM\n----------------------------------------------\n@wolfgang: I know that he associated himself with that weird group. But when did he undersign the rethinkers? Last year, two years ago, five years ago? I could not find any hint on their website. And does his signature mean that he should be automatically banned from ScienceBlogs for life?\nI am not against calling out Ehrgartner for his claims. I just question the tone. We should really make an effort to argue with people we do not agree with in a somewhat civil manner. I know I fail that test sometimes, too. But all the agression and the anger directed against this one person...\nPosted by: Christian | December 2, 2008 11:58 AM\n----------------------------------------------\nAsking for studies to look? Not a big problem.\nClaiming a connection despite existing studies showing provisional falsification? Problem.\nClaiming any opposition is because of \"big pharma\"? BIG problem.\nFeel free to keep looking, so long as you keep publishing the \"still nothing here\" papers. But don't take the mockery as anything but your just due for looking in an apparent dead-end; just say \"Fools, I'll show you all!!!\" (with optional maniacal laugh), get back to work, and be sure to mention the mockers by name at your awards acceptance speeches if/when you solidly prove your conjecture.\nPosted by: abb3w | December 2, 2008 12:00 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nAnd does his signature mean that he should be automatically banned from ScienceBlogs for life?\nNot necessarily, but he sure as hell should have to explain himself, and if he no longer believes in \"rethinking AIDS\" he should tell RA to take his name off of its website. That's a start.\nAs for the \"aggression and anger,\" I'm actually more annoyed with Peter Artmann now than Bert Ehgartner. Artmann is explicitly advocating quackery.\nPosted by: Orac | December 2, 2008 12:00 PM\n----------------------------------------------\n@Christian: \"it seems very odd to me, that you would actually link someone who writes an article about aluminum in vaccines - no matter how wrong this article may be - to a Holocaust denier.\" Who did so? It certainly wasn't me. If you think so, read my post again. I actually came to Artmanns and Ehgartners defence when they were linked with Hamer.\n\"Furthermore, I fail to understand why none of the people who are obviously very agitated by Ehrgartners arguments would bother to just compile a bunch of links to scientific, peer-reviewed studies, that devalidate his claims.\"\nBut people did so in the comments to their articles and Ulrich did so, too.\n[http://www.scienceblogs.de/kritisch-gedacht/2008/12/aluminium-adhs.php](http://www.scienceblogs.de/kritisch-gedacht/2008/12/aluminium-adhs.php)\nJust a personal note: I have seen what AIDS-Denialism does. I have no understanding whatsoever for people who peddle dangerous unscientific nonsense in medicine. And although I have been fighting holocaust denialists for some time now and although these people are the most despicable rabid morons ever, at least nobody dies from their sick lies.\nPosted by: Jane | December 2, 2008 12:06 PM\n----------------------------------------------\n@Orac: I know that your mentioning of Holocaust denialism does not mean that you called Ehrgartner a Nazi. Still, it is a remarkably crass connotation. I doubt that I would ever feel compelled to make that kind of comparison even when confronted with the most hideously false statements in my area of research.\nAnyway, the discussion is moot now, since Ehrgartner has been fired from ScienceBlogs already due to the outrage over his aluminum article. I somewhat doubt that this is the best possible decision but so be it.\nPosted by: Christian | December 2, 2008 12:11 PM\n----------------------------------------------\n@christian.\nWhen you look at the list of people who singned the rethinker list you will find Bert Ehgartner making advertisment for his first book \"Die Lebensformel\" this book was launched in 2004.\nSo he must have signed after this date. If Ehgartner want to get off the list he could immideately cancel his signature.\nPosted by: Wolfgang | December 2, 2008 12:15 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nChristian, dude, before you make an ass of yourself-- search SciBlogs for 'vaccination' 'thermisol' 'autism' 'HIV' 'denialism', etc.\nSeveral of us over here have had anti-vaxers/HIV Deniers/woo peddlers in our cross-hairs for years (me, Orac, Aetiology, Denialsim Blog, etc).\nThis might be a new topic to you, but its old as the hills for us-- we spend a considerable amount of time and effort explaining the science of these topics to normal people to combat the idiocy of the tards you have on German SciBlogs.\nWe are pretty damn pissed off.\nPosted by: ERV | December 2, 2008 12:26 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nChristian, The cause of any dismissal is due to what he wrote, which was patently irresponsible and plainly false, not the reaction to it.\nPosted by: Robster, FCD | December 2, 2008 12:27 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nCristian, your area of reserch is computer science this is medicine we're talking about, HIV/AIDS denial is causing a holocaust of it's own in some parts of the world. In medicine psuedo-science kills people, in computers it just means you've bought vista.\nPosted by: Ramel | December 2, 2008 12:29 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nThis may be the impetus I need to brush up on my German. :-P\nPosted by: Aaron Golas | December 2, 2008 12:30 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nAnyway, the discussion is moot now, since Ehrgartner has been fired from ScienceBlogs already due to the outrage over his aluminum article. I somewhat doubt that this is the best possible decision but so be it.\nActually, if this is true, I'm not entirely sure the worst offender is gone. In the two days since I first posted, I've--shall we say?--done some \"rethinking\" (sorry, couldn't resist). That rethinking has led me to believe that Peter Artmann might well be a worse offender than Bert Ehgartner as far as peddling pseudoscience goes.\nPosted by: Orac | December 2, 2008 12:34 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nAlmost sad that he's gone (Ehrgartner) I'd just come up with a plan to sneak my experiment passed an ethics comitte...\nPosted by: Ramel | December 2, 2008 12:45 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nIn medicine psuedo-science kills people, in computers it just means you've bought vista.\nRamel, I may have to steal that line. It's hilarious.\nPosted by: Orac | December 2, 2008 12:47 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nFeel free, but if it makes you a profit I want a cut\nPosted by: Ramel | December 2, 2008 1:08 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nIn order for me to get worried that booting these crackpots from ScienceBlogs would impede the discussion here, I'd have to be presented with a legitimate grey area. Arguing over the side effects of a particular drug, or debating the interpretation of a particular set of animal-intelligence experiments, is insignificant next to the wholesale denial of modern science implicit in endorsing Ayurvedic \"medicine\". By way of analogy, imagine that ScienceBlogs.de had hired an astrologer (perhaps even a Vedic one). Would kicking them off the site hamper the discussions among real astronomers about whether liquid water exists on Saturn's moon Enceladus? Of course not. Would it have a \"chilling effect\" on the (largely political) argument over whether to continue manned spaceflight? I highly doubt it.\nSo, when Orac says the following:\nI realize that there has been a fair amount of whining and wringing of hands in the comments, in which the ever-reliable logical fallacy of the slippery slope argument has led a couple of commenters to ask \"But where do you draw the line? Where will it all end?\" This is accompanied with the suggestion that enforcing some standards against obvious pseudoscience will inevitably lead to the censoring of posts that stray from a ScienceBlogs-imposed political and scientific orthodoxy and muzzling any blogger with controversial views. Bullshit.\nI fully agree.\nPosted by: Blake Stacey | December 2, 2008 1:10 PM\n----------------------------------------------\n[https://twitter.com/Scienceblogs/status/1034440130](https://twitter.com/Scienceblogs/status/1034440130)\n..good bye Bert Ehgartner !\nPosted by: Conrad | December 2, 2008 1:16 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nRamelk said,\n\"Cristian, your area of reserch [sic.]is computer science this is medicine we're talking about, HIV/AIDS denial is causing a holocaust of it's own in some parts of the world. In medicine psuedo-science kills people, in computers it just means you've bought vista.\"\nI don't mean to cause a war between disciplines, but I am also a computer scientist* and I think you're mistaken about more than one of your claims.\n* - Though I prefer the term \"cognitive scientist\" as I research A.I., cognitive psychology, philosophy, and some neuroscience. It also has the benefit of immunizing myself from questions like, \"My computer's task bar disappeared, how do I restore it?\"\nFirst, I don't think that because one is from outside the medical profession that they cannot research, and learn about manufactured controversies; such as HIV/AIDS denial, or anti-vaccination. I think science bloggers like Orac do a great deal to help me understand the issue, and I think this has helped me pursue additional sources for edifying myself on the issue. I do think that we should be humble about this knowledge, as we don't have the many years of experience Orac has in the medical profession, but I don't think we should be afraid of discussing the topics at a \"popular science\" level of framing with our friends and family, distinguished medical experts, or if we should ever encounter an anti-vaccination movement in our local communities, our local newspapers and politicians.\nSecond, in computer science, bad methods can kill people. Computers are utilized throughout the world. They're utilized for the defense of numerous nations, the stability of our infrastructure, transportation, search and rescue, disaster management, and yes, even the medical profession. These devices needs to meet certain standards or people die. It's crass to suggest that computer scientists don't have to worry about human lives, just operating system functionality (which also, might cost human lives if it fails at an inopportune time).\nThird, your science is supported by computer scientists that work on developing, and improving medical imaging technology and software. It's also supported by data analysis tools and large scale data management. We'd never be able to analyze the vast amount of genomic data we have on the variety of viruses without the aid of the computer scientists that develop these tools:\n[http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/11/scale_how_large_quantities_of.php](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/11/scale_how_large_quantities_of.php)\nSimilar issues of analysis, and scale can be found in other scientific disciplines.\nForth, our field is not immune from quackery. See this software retailer scamming consumers with his \"homeopathic\" computer software, and the subsequent debunking by a computer scientist:\nLardge J, \"Salt lamp: heated Himalayan salt improves your health\" in There Goes the Science Bit..., Sense About Science, 2007. pg. 5\n[http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/voys/theregoesthesciencebit.pdf](http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/voys/theregoesthesciencebit.pdf)\nPosted by: MKandefer | December 2, 2008 1:32 PM\n----------------------------------------------\n\"Ramel, I may have to steal that line.

It's not our fault that these guys are arguing *like* neo-Nazis. They are continuing to use debunked lines of argument, ignoring new evidence that's contradictory to their views, stubbornly clinging to their conclusions despite scientific consensuses (consensi?) to the contrary ... all classic denialist strategies.\nThey're putting themselves in line with holocaust deniers with their BS-filled arguments.\nPosted by: bob | December 2, 2008 1:56 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nNow, no one around here claims that we ScienceBloggers are all above reproach and unfailingly brilliant, that we're all saintly, or that we never, ever write stupid things. Certainly, I don't, and certainly I've never claimed not to have fallen prey to my own personal foibles, resulting in the occasional dubious (or in retrospect completely embarrassing) post. And certainly, there have been quite a few times when I've strongly, even violently disagreed with something that a fellow ScienceBlogger has written and said so, even just last week.\nOh, sure - provide a link to an example of the second but not the first. What fun is that?\nPosted by: SC | December 2, 2008 2:10 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nMKandefer:\nAs one CS to another, lighten up. It was a cute throwaway line.\nOf course bad software can kill. More than twenty years ago our office had a poster on the wall of a pilot punching out of an F-16 in flight, with the caption\nFly-by-Wire gives a whole new meaning to the term 'System Crash.'\nMore recently, a good bit of our current economic meltdown seems to be the result of financial-system software with unexamined premises and dubious logic -- and that's closer to pseudo-science rather than just bad execution of good science. Before anyone goes all holy on \"lives vs. mere money,\" keep in mind that there are always tradeoffs. A billion here and a billion there just might make the difference between life and death for someone.\nStill, it's a great line.\nPosted by: D. C.

Would that be all right?\nCongratulations, you've won The Internet!\n. . .\nFollowing up on what I said in my last comment, it occurs to me that the presence of these antiscientific crackpots can itself cause a \"chilling effect\", if for no other reason that we science bloggers are doing this gig in our copious free time. The more we have to smack down pseudoscience and pseudomedicine, the less time we have to actually have fun and spread a positive message about science. You think the internecine quarrels among English-speaking SciBlings are bad, and that our recurring sound-and-fury exchanges are too boring to read anymore? Imagine that, but significantly worse.\nIf the only purpose of a science blog were to bash creationists, I for one would have gotten tired of the hobby a long time ago. (The same goes for the idea that the primary aim of science blogging is and should be \"gee whiz! science is shiny!\" cheerleading.) I don't want to have to deal with blatant nonsense and the unsinkable rubber ducks who espouse it any more than I have to, and having these loonballs under the ScienceBlogs banner would certainly shift the balance of obligation in the direction I would not enjoy.\nPosted by: Blake Stacey | December 2, 2008 2:34 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nD.C. says,\n\"As one CS to another, lighten up. It was a cute throwaway line. [...] Still, it's a great line.\"\nI'm less concerned with the quote, than the context it was offered in, which was to malign computer scientists as outsiders to medicine, incapable of contributing to the discussion. I also wasn't trying to focus on bad software, which as you appropriately point out is related to pseudoscience, but also good software which is used exclusively for the purpose of saving lives, such as disaster management software. It might have been a \"cute throwaway line\", and I may need to lighten up, but that doesn't make the line (in the context it was offered in) any less false.\nPosted by: MKandefer | December 2, 2008 2:38 PM\nI'm less concerned with the quote, than the context it was offered in, which was to malign computer scientists as outsiders to medicine, incapable of contributing to the discussion.\nHey, I resemble that remark!\nI am a CS (among other things) and as Orac omnisciently knows have been slugging it out with woo merchants for more than a decade. I even like to think that I sometimes have something positive to contribute on health topics other than anti-woo, but that may be a conceit of an admittedly inflated ego.\nAnyone who can reason logically (and one hopes that CS isn't totally destructive to that ability) has lots to contribute, particularly when the \"opposition\" are the minions of irrationality.\nPosted by: D. C. Sessions | December 2, 2008 2:45 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nTo be clear, I'm not putting computer science down and I recognise that when computers fail or are miss-used lives can be lost. The key difference is that medical and biological information is important to all our lives in the most fundimental way (except for orac, living creatures are just his hobby) and bad information can be spread a long way and can exist in the public conciousness for a very long time. Bad information leads people to make bad decisions (and we're back to buying vista), I'm stuck with an OS that I hate untill I can afford to change but a cancer patient that chooses alt med over real med will probably die. Thats the point I'm trying to make. And vista sucks.\nPosted by: Ramel | December 2, 2008 2:47 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nReading the responses to my comment I feel I should clear up any confusion over myself, I am not a health professional nor did I intend to imply that I was. Like D.C. Sessions I have been following debates on woo and psuedo-science for a long time and I feel (and DC may be right about the ego bit) that I occasionally have something to offer a debate. Usually in the form of cruel and/or unusual snarkyness. And I never pass up an oppertunity to bash vista.\nPosted by: Ramel | December 2, 2008 2:57 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nThanks Ramel. If I understand your point, you're claiming that everyday choices normal people make with regards to computers have little impact on their health, while they do when it comes to medicine. Fair enough, I can agree with that. However, I would encourage you (and any interest computer scientists) to read this (fixed the reference from the previous post):\nSheldon T, \"Computer Clear uses your PC to release over 34,000 different homoeopathic type remedies into you\" in There Goes the Science Bit..., Sense About Science, 2007. pg. 5\n[http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/voys/theregoesthesciencebit.pdf](http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/voys/theregoesthesciencebit.pdf)\nI thought it was interesting that pseudoscience concepts like homeopathy are applied to software in an effort to make a buck. The rationality for mechanism underlying the software is also a hilarious read.\nPosted by: MKandefer | December 2, 2008 3:17 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nOrac you are missing the links in the statement \"ones similar to the ones I had taken on here and here.\"\nPosted by: Danimal | December 2, 2008 3:19 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nMKanefer I think we're on the same page now.

Do you think, I say: heavy-metal is not harmful?\nThat's rubbish.\nI say: Ayurveda is not science.\nThat's why nobody can say it is wrong.\nAyurveda is simply without any rights and rules and everybody can tell: From now on I am an Ayurvedan physician.\nEach village builds there own medicines - do you know what's inside their pot? Does Saper know it?\nBut if you want to fight against something you need to have a target. Where is it?\nI have been to some parts of india, maybe you should see it, too.\nThere is no bad science in Ayurveda. It is just no science at all.\nBut the most disturbing thing is: People take this kind of medicine ... and they don't get sick.\nOften they get better.\nI saw it and I am still looking for an explanation. Do you have it?\nAnd by the way ... you are talking about lead, but did you notice the dirt?\nAnyway I have put an update in my old post.\n[http://www.scienceblogs.de/medlog/2008/09/ayurveda-enthalt-blei-ach-nee.php](http://www.scienceblogs.de/medlog/2008/09/ayurveda-enthalt-blei-ach-nee.php)\nIt's in german.\nPosted by: Peter Artmann | December 2, 2008 3:57 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nNice of you that you don't recommend for anyone to take toxic heavy metals in lethal doses. What would have helped so would have been a recommendation of staying a mile away of Ayurveda since you can't tell if any of the homebrews contains the poison or not, instead of claiming it's intolerant of us to condemn the use of it. Odd, these scientists and their idea of 21st century != 19th century.\nPosted by: Mu | December 2, 2008 4:19 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nWell, I live in Europe, you live in the states, they live in India.

They have just a different method to cure people. I am not recommending it.\nWhat about you? Are you going to destroy their pots?\nSome time ago the europeans went to america and brought Jesus to native americans. They were certain to bring the best of all medicine.\nPosted by: Peter Artmann | December 2, 2008 4:35 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nNobody can say it's wrong, eh? But, surely you are saying it's right: those who take such medicine don't get worse, and they often get better. So, if they did get worse, or they didn't get any better, then we'd surely say it's wrong, too.\nEverybody should see India for their own personal anecdote, which is how science works anyways.\nPosted by: Koray | December 2, 2008 4:50 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nTo the various CS's above: from one CS to the others, that *was* a funny line. As inaccurate as it was funny, but funny nonetheless. Well, there was a grain of truth (which seems to have been recognized universally by now): we don't deal directly with matters of life-and-death, whereas in medical science they do.\nJust to throw in an anecdote: when I went from biologist to computer scientist to engineer, I got a lot more dangerous. Whereas at first about the worst I could do was come tumbling out of a forest canopy, maybe bringing a colleague or two with me, now ... let's just say that if I took a homeopathic approach to verifying the correctness of a braking circuit for an automobile, that would do a lot more harm.\nPosted by: Thomas | December 2, 2008 4:52 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nPeter,\nI don't know if it's the language barrier or you, but what you just wrote doesn't even make sense.\nOf course, what you said in your post about Ayruvedic medicines and heavy metal contamination in the post I linked to didn't make sense either, and there wasn't the excuse of not using your native language.\nPosted by: Orac | December 2, 2008 4:52 PM\n----------------------------------------------\nBut the most disturbing thing is: People take this kind of medicine ... and they don't get sick.\nOh, really?\nOften they get better.\nI'm sure the placebo effect is a wholly American phenomenon.\nPosted by: Blake Stacey | December 2, 2008 4:54 PM\n----------------------------------------------\n@Peter: Die Dumm, es brennt!\n@Orac: It's an okay summary of his update.

If you don't want to get called out for your stupidity, don't write stupid things.\n5. In unserer freiheitlich liebenden europ\u00e4ischen Kultur wissen wir jedoch auch, dass das erste Mittel gegen Syphilis auf Arsen basierte und dass nahezu alles, was wir heute verdammen, vor gar nicht allzu langer Zeit auch hierzulande als Medikament eingesetzt wurde. Es gibt deshalb keinen Grund auf die Medizinsysteme anderer L\u00e4nder ver\u00e4chtlich herabzublicken.\n5. In our liberty-loving, European Culture, we are well aware, that the first Syphilis cure was based on arsenic. And that almost anything we are condemning today was, until recently, used here as medicine, too. That's why there's no reason to be condescending towards the medical systems of other countries.\nYeah, liberty sure has a long tradition in European Culture, eh? And there's a difference between drugs based on something and drugs consisting of something. And yes, there was pseudoscientific medicine in Europe, but guess what? We got rid of that! That's the whole point - the methods which were used did more harm than good and were discarded. Easy, huh? Why should we even be respectful towards a medical system that has no plausible mechanism, hurts more people than it heals (by far) and has shown nothing a placebo couldn't do just as well (maybe without the accidental deaths...)\n6.

In some times a lot of people demonstrate and even fight for them, and in other time, there is mostly talking.\nAnd this leads to the next question for me: What would happen, if the german devision of the seed media group finaly decides, there is no actual need to take action? Will everything goes back to normal, when the interest in this discussion decrease? Or would any involved blogger take consequences and say \"I dont wanna have my name or my work connected with unscientific quackery, and because its wether him or me, i leave scienceblogs\".\nPerhaps it could be called childish, but on the other hand i dont understand the tendency to complain and talk about things, which one disfavours, but having no option to act..\nPosted by: Adromir | December 3, 2008 12:59 AM\n----------------------------------------------\nWithout having read all the comments:\nI say kick them out of scienceblogs.de. Tolerance and slippery slope arguments take you just so far, but there is a point when a decision has to be made. Its not on a whim, its because of good and sound arguments, its not my 2c, not an opinion. You can clearly say that those two bloggers have a non-scientific mindset and therefore should look for a forum elsewhere.\nPosted by: bcpmoon | December 3, 2008 2:10 AM\n----------------------------------------------\nThe twitter links posted by Tobias and Conrad lead to the below.
