The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine normative values on postural control measured by the force plate Leonardo Mechanograph\u00ae and to analyze the influence of age and sex on balance performance. A set of standardized standing positions with eyes opened (Romberg, semi-tandem, tandem, unipedal standing) was carried out. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to detect age-and sex-related differences in center of pressure (COP) parameters (path length, velocity, elliptical area, anterior-posterior, and medio-lateral directions). Measurements were available for 570 subjects aged 20\u201386 years. Statistical analysis showed a high effect of age group on postural control (partial n\u00b2 between 0.1 and 0.4) with a U-shaped dependency between postural control and age for all area- and path-related COP parameters, with the largest sway in the youngest (aged 20\u201340) and the oldest age group (aged 60\u201386). For velocity of COP, a linear deterioration with increasing age was found. Medio-lateral components of COP are likely to indicate the extent of postural control. Significant sex differences were not clearly supported by current findings. Age- and sex-related normative values are a useful resource for diagnostic, research, and training.", "sitename": "Journal of Functional Morphology and Kinesiology", "date": "2020-03-07", "id": null, "license": null, "body": null, "comments": "", "commentsbody": null, "raw_text": null, "text": "Reference values of sway parameters have not been published for the Leonardo mechanograph\u00ae so far.
