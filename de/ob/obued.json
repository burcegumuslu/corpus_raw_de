The COVID 19-pandemic polarizes. So the conclusion of Markus Hadler, sociologist at the University of Graz. In a joint research project with Graz University of Technology, he analysed the polarization of public opinion in the corona debate. And he confirms conspiracy theories: \"A little more than half of the interviewed people believe in the natural transmission of the virus from animals to humans, while a third thinks it was consciously developed by humans in the laboratory.\" Therefore the question: Will vaccinations quell the spread of conspiracy theories?\n[Clip ](https://youtu.be/IpFVSSuGHsI)(German only)\n\u201cIf you ask me whether vaccinations will put an end to conspiracy theories, my answer is a clear no. Conspiracy theories often promulgate the notion that there are secret groups working behind the scenes to advance their own interests. In the context of coronavirus, one story is that the virus was deliberately released and intentionally spread.\nWhat do Austrians think about this? Surveys show that only a very small number of people think it likely, for instance, that mobile phone masts are responsible for coronavirus, or that microchips will be implanted when you are vaccinated. We know that almost half the Austrian population wants to be vaccinated as soon as possible. Around a third remains sceptical. So public opinion is increasingly in favour of vaccinations. Will that put an end to conspiracy theories? No, scepticism toward vaccinations is not the same as conspiracy theories. And those kinds of theories thrive on the fact that only a few people believe them.\u201c", "language": null, "image": "https://www.uni-graz.at/fileadmin/portal/Im_Fokus/2021/210322hadler_frage_en.jpg", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["#sl-content", "#sl-breadcrumb", "#sl-mainnav", "#sl-subnav", "#sl-info", "#sl-settings", "#sl-search", "#sl-skiplinks", "/de/neuigkeiten/clip-klar-7/", "https://search.uni-graz.at", "/en/news/openidconnect?tx_openidconnect=login&tx_openidconnect_redirecturi=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uni-graz.at%2Fen%2Fnews%2Fclip-klar-7%2F&cHash=d17e1d2541093e74f30811015ecf06d5", "#sl-skiplinks", "#sl-skiplinks", "/en/university/about-the-university/mission-statement/", "/en/university/about-the-university/", "/en/university/organisation/", "/en/university/faculties/", "https://ub.uni-graz.at/en/", "https://jobs.uni-graz.at/en/", "/en/university/campus/", "/en/research-profile/our-expertise/", "/en/research-profile/our-expertise/", "/en/research-profile/research-questions/", "https://online.uni-graz.at/kfu_online/wbForschungsportal.cbShowPortal", "https://www.bienenforschungspark.at/", "https://forschungsmanagement.uni-graz.at/en/service-for-companies/", "/en/research-profile/ethics-in-research/", "/en/studies/", "/en/study/prospective-students/", "/en/study/students/", "https://online.uni-graz.at/kfu_online/ee/ui/ca2/app/desktop/#/pl/ui/$ctx/wbSelbstRegPerson.register?$ctx=design=ca2;header=max", "/en/community/international/", "/en/community/international/", "/en/community/location/", "/en/community/research-and-business/", "https://alumni.uni-graz.at", "/en/spotlight/", "https://www.uni-graz.at/en/studies/studying-at-the-university-of-graz/masters-plus/", "https://klimaneutral.uni-graz.at/en/", "/en/research-profile/research-questions/researchers-answer/", "https://alumni.uni-graz.at/en/", "https://karriere.uni-graz.at", "#", "#sl-skiplinks", "https://www.uni-graz.at/", "/en/", "/en/news/", "#sl-skiplinks", "https://static.uni-graz.at/fileadmin/portal/Im_Fokus/2021/210322hadler_frage_en.jpg", "https://youtu.be/IpFVSSuGHsI", "#", "https://www.uni-graz.at/en/news/wie-bienen-co-die-welt-sehen-mit-einem-algorithmus-durch-die-insekten-brille-schauen/", "https://www.uni-graz.at/en/news/licht-mikros/", "https://www.uni-graz.at/en/news/nachhaltige-stahlproduktion/", "", "https://www.google.com/maps/place/Universit%C3%A4t+Graz/@47.0776328,15.4495241,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x476e4a78f6e983ad:0xcf40746b8134b4ed!8m2!3d47.0776328!4d15.4495241!16zL20vMDF6Z3Zt", "/en/contact/", "/en/web-editors/", "https://moodle.uni-graz.at", "https://online.uni-graz.at/kfu_online/ee/ui/ca2/app/desktop/#/login?$ctx=lang=en", "/en/imprint/", "/en/data-protection-declaration/", "/en/accessibility-declaration/", "https://www.facebook.com/UniversitaetGraz", "https://www.instagram.com/universityofgraz/", "https://www.twitter.com/UniGraz", "https://www.youtube.com/unigraz", "https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-graz/", "https://www.kununu.com/at/karl-franzens-universitaet-graz4", "https://www.xing.com/companies/karl-franzens-universit%C3%A4tgraz", "#sl-skiplinks", "#sl-skiplinks"]}
