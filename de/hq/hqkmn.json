To better understand the role of stem cells in \npromoting recovery, the location and function of grafted cells must be monitored \nin vivo  using noninvasive imaging. Here we describe a novel combination of two \nnoninvasive modalities for imaging neural progenitor cells, namely 19F Magnetic \nresonance imaging (MRI) and Bioluminescence imaging (BLI). 19F MRI presents the \nadvantage of a high spatial resolution and a lack of background signal, permitting \nthe unambiguous localization and quantification of cells in the host organ. \nIn combination with a 1H MRI scan, detected cells can be placed within their \nanatomical context. BLI, on the other hand, can provide insight into the functional \nstatus and viability of cells. \nMethods:  A neural progenitor cell line transfected to stably express the membrane-\nbound form of the Gaussia luciferase was incubated with a perfluoropolyether \n(PFPE) emulsion. In vitro  19F MR spectroscopy of fixed, labeled cells was carried \nout at 11.7T (Bruker BioSpec, Ettlingen, Germany) using a single pulse sequence. \nQuantification of cellular uptake was carried out by comparing the areas under \nthe peaks of a KF standard and of the PFPE to determine the number of 19F spins \nper cell in the sample. The optimum concentration of PFPE to maximize the 19F MR \nsignal was determined and employed for all subsequent experiments. The effects \nof labeling on cell vitality, proliferation, migration, and differentiation were \nassessed, using the Trypan blue exclusion assay, a Neubauer chamber, a scratch \nassay and immunocytochemical stainings. Labeled cells were implanted into the \nstriatum of mice. 48 h later, in vivo  19F MRI and 1H MRI scans were conducted at \n11.7 T using turbo spin echo sequences (total acquisition time = 1.5 h). For BLI \nexperiments, different amounts of transfected and wild-type cells were seeded, \nthe substrate coelenterazine was added, and samples were placed into an optical \nimaging system (Biospace, Paris, France). Scanned cells were harvested, fixed, and \nseeded in two different quantities and 19F MRI was conducted for multimodal \ndetection.\nResults:  In vitro  19F MR scans proved consistent, high cellular uptake of PFPE. \nLabeling did not affect cell vitality, migration and differentiation. However, it \ntransiently slowed cell proliferation. Using in vivo 19F MRI, labeled cells could easily \nbe detected and localized. Cells could also be detected in vitro  using BLI and a \nlinear correlation of the BLI signal and the cell number was found. The multimodal \ndetectability of the cells was proven through the subsequent 19F MRI.Abstrakts7Conclusions:  For the first time, 19F MRI and BLI were combined to image neural \nprogenitor cells. Multimodal imaging of implanted cells provides a combination \nof structural and functional information, which will permit to further optimize \npreclinical protocols for stem cell-mediated functional recovery in acute and \nneurodegenerative disorders of the brain.\nAcknowledgements : This work was financially supported by grants \nfrom the Volkswagen Foundation (I/83 443) and the ENCITE EU-FP7 \n(HEALTH-F5-2008-201842) program.8Increased intrinsic network connectivity in grapheme-colour synaesthesia \nAnna Dovern1,2, Gereon R. Fink1,2, A. Christina B. Fromme1 , Afra M. Wohlschl\u00e4ger3, \nPeter H. Weiss1,2 & Valentin Riedl3\n1Institute of Neuroscience & Medicine (INM-3), Research Centre J\u00fclich, J\u00fclich, \nGermany\n2Department of Neurology, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany \n3Departments of Neuroradiology, Neurology, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technische \nUniversit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany \nIntroduction:  Although to date the underlying neural mechanisms of synaesthesia \nremain elusive, it has often been hypothesized that the concomitant synaesthetic \nperception of a sensation not inherent to the stimulus is caused by an increased \nconnectivity between the relevant brain regions. That is, in the case of grapheme-\ncolour synaesthesia, occipital and temporal brain regions involved in grapheme \nand colour processing, but also parietal and frontal areas involved in binding \nprocesses. Support for increased structural  connectivity in grapheme-colour \nsynaesthetes is provided by diffusion tensor imaging studies. However, an \ninvestigation (with functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) of coherent \nneuronal activity, i.e. functional  connectivity in synaesthesia, is lacking to date. \nMethods: Twelve grapheme-colour synaesthetes and twelve control subjects \n(matched for gender, age, IQ, and handedness) were scanned with fMRI during \na resting-state period of 10 minutes. Intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) were \nextracted from the resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data by applying independent \ncomponent analysis. A multiple spatial regression analysis revealed seven \nsynaesthesia-relevant ICNs: medial and lateral visual network, auditory network, \nleft and right fronto-parietal network, and medial and lateral parietal network. \nFor each subject, the functional network connectivity (FNC) was characterized by \ncalculating pairwise zero-lag time course correlations between these seven ICNs \nusing the FNC toolbox. \nResults: The FNC analysis of the seven synaesthesia relevant ICNs revealed \nfive significant connections for the control group (as indexed by significant \ncorrelations between the time courses of the seven ICNs). In stark contrast, 15 \nsignificant connections between the seven ICNs were present in the synaesthetes. \nFurthermore, the direct group comparison revealed that two specific network \nconnections were significantly stronger in the synaesthetes: the connections \nbetween the medial and lateral visual networks and the right fronto-parietal \nnetwork. The connection between the lateral visual and auditory networks showed \na trend towards significance. Moreover, increased intrinsic network connectivity \ncorrelated significantly with the consistency of synaesthetic experiences. \nDiscussion: Supporting neurobiological models of synaesthesia which hypothesize \nincreased connectivity in synaesthesia, the current rs-fMRI study reveals, for the \nfirst time, increased global and specific (intrinsic)  functional  network connectivity \nin grapheme-colour synaesthetes, complementing earlier findings of increased 9structural  connectivity. Our data are consistent with prior data suggesting \nthat differences in intrinsic network connectivity are directly related to the \nphenomenology of human experiences: persons with additional experiences \n(either extraordinary, as in the case of synaesthesia, or pathologically, as in \nschizophrenia) exhibit increased functional network connectivity, while persons \nwith neurological or psychiatric deficits resulting in limited experiences (e.g., as in \ndementia) exhibit reduced functional connectivity.10PDE4-Inhibition Facilitates Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity and Rescues MK801-\ninduced Long-term Impairment in LTP and Object Recognition Memory in Freely \nMoving Rats\nValentina Wiescholleck1,2,3, Denise Manahan-Vaughan1,2 \nRuhr University Bochum, 1Medical Faculty, Department of Neurophysiology, \nMA4/149;  2International Graduate School of Neuroscience; 3Research School; \n44780 Bochum, Germany.\nInhibition of phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) by Rolipram (4-(3-(Cyclopentyloxy)-\n4-methoxyphenyl)-pyrrolidin-2-one) has been the focus of many behavioral and \nmolecular studies in the recent years. Rolipram exhibits a memory-enhancing \neffect in rodents. In-vitro  studies have shown that long-term potentiation (LTP), \nwhich is believed to comprise a cellular substrate for learning, is also enhanced \nby Rolipram. However, effects have not been assessed in-vivo . Rolipram has \nantipsychotic properties. Psychosis affects cognition, and in animal models \nof psychosis LTP is impaired. In this study, we investigated if PDE4-inhibition \nimproves LTP in healthy animals in-vivo . Furthermore, we explored if PDE4-\ninhibition rescues impaired LTP and prevents object recognition memory deficits \nin an animal model of psychosis. \nMale Wistar rats (7 \u2013 8 weeks old) were implanted chronically with a bipolar \nstimulation electrode in the medial perforant pathway and a monopolar recording \nelectrode in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer, as well as with a cannula in the \nipsilateral cerebral ventrical to enable drug application. In vivo electrophysiological \nexperiments were conducted ca. 10 d after surgery. Short-term potentiation (STP) \nor LTP were elicited by using high frequency tetanisation (three bursts of 15 pulses \nat 200 Hz and 10 sec interburst interval or ten bursts of 15 pulses at 200 Hz and \n10 sec interburst interval, respectively) in freely moving rats. Rats were injected \nsystemically with either MK801 or saline. 1 week later LTP or object recognition \nwas assessed. Rolipram was applied either intracerebrally or subcutaneously. \nIn healthy animals, both intracerebral and subcutaneous treatment with Rolipram, \nfacilitated short-term potentiation (STP) into LTP, suggesting that PDE4 inhibition \nmay play a permissive role in plasticity mechanisms that are relevant for learning \nand memory. One week after a single systemic treatment with the irreversible \nN-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, MK801, LTP and object recognition memory \nwere significantly impaired, but were rescued by PDE4 inhibition. \nThese data suggest that the relief of cognitive disturbances in psychosis models \nby Rolipram, may be mediated in part by a rescue of hippocampal LTP and that \nPDE4-inhibition could be given consideration as a therapeutic strategy in the \ntreatment of psychosis-related diseases.11Attentional Modulation by tDCS in stroke\nRoy L\u00b9 \u00b2, Hesse MD\u00b2 \u00b3, Sparing R\u00b2 \u00b3, Fink GR\u00b2 \u00b3\n1Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, Netherlands\n2Department of Neurology, University Hospital Cologne, Germany\n3Cognitive Neurology Section, Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-3), \nResearch Center Juelich, Juelich, Germany\nBackground:  Attentional deficits are a common consequence after stroke, \nparticularly in the early phase. Yet, especially a functioning attentional system \nis essential for all cognitive and visuospatial processes and thereby an important \nprecondition for rehabilitative interventions during stroke recovery. Being the most \nbasic intensity aspect of attention, alertness is considered to be a prerequisite for \nmore complex attention processes.  Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) \nhas proven to be a helpful device in the treatment of motor and spatial deficits \nafter stroke; hence it might also be a promising option in attentional recovery. \nObjective:   Enhancement of right hemispheric (RH) stroke patients\u2019 alertness \nlevels by stimulating their right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.  Examining \nthe feasibility of this sort of tDCS study with stroke patients.\nMethods:  So far two subacute RH stroke patients from a university hospital and \none RH stroke patient from the chronic phase were included. Anodal (excitatory) \nreal tDCS (2mA for 20 min) and sham stimulation (2mA for 1 min) was applied. \nPost stimulation effects and pre stimulation baseline attentional function were \nassessed by three subtests that constitute the minimal set of the computerized \nTests for Attentional Performance (TAP) battery: the alertness, divided attention \nand the Go/NoGo (selective attention) subtests.\nResults:  In the chronic patient, alertness performance increased significantly after \nleft sided tDCS. A significant increase in alertness performance after tDCS in the \nsubacute patients could not be shown with the sample size of two. In order to \nmeasure tDCS related attention improvement, the alertness task is a feasible \nmeans of examining alertness, whereas the divided attention task seems to be \ntoo difficult. Feasibility of the Go/NoGo task remains to be further investigated.\nConclusion:  Preliminary results of 3 patients indicate feasibility of the study \nprotocol with minor adjustments in order to investigate improvement effects of \ntDCS on alertness performance: The TAP divided attention task will be excluded; \nself-report questionnaires to control for motivation-, practice and fatigue effects \nwill be added.12Social Cognition during Experimental Human Endotoxemia: an fMRI Study\nJennifer S.

The aim of this \nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to investigate the effects \nof experimentally induced acute inflammation on social cognition performance \nand neural response in healthy subjects.\nMethods:  In a double-blind, randomized crossover study, 18 healthy, right-handed \nmale volunteers received an injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0.4ng/kg E.coli) \nor saline. Plasma levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and cortisol as \nwell as mood ratings were analyzed together with brain activation during a social \ncognition task (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test).                                                                                                           \nResults:  LPS administration induced pronounced transient increases in pro- (IL-6, \nTNF-\u03b1) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10, IL-1ra) cytokines as well as cortisol plasma \nconcentrations. Further, positive mood was decreased and state anxiety elevated. \nHowever, social cognition performance was not affected by acute inflammation. \nIn contrast, the LPS condition showed increased responses in the fusiform gyrus, \nmiddle temporal gyrus, temporo-parietal junction, superior temporal gyrus and \nprecuneus during the social cognition task. \nDiscussion:  The increased task-related responses in the LPS condition may reflect \na compensatory strategy of the brain to maintain normal task performance and \nensure social support from others during physical weakness.  \nFunding: German Research Foundation (Sche 341/14-1)13Exercise during pregnancy mitigates Alzheimer-like pathology in mice offspring\nHerring A1, Donath A1, Lewejohann L2, Ludwig F2, Yarmolenko M1, Uslar E1, \nConzen C1, Kanakis D1, Bosma C1, Worm K1, Sachser N2, Paulus W3 and Keyvani K1\n1Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology, Department of Neuropathology, \nUniversity Hospital Essen\n2Department of Behavioural Biology, University of Muenster \n3Institute of Neuropathology, University Hospital Muenster\nIntroduction:  Physical activity protects brain function in healthy individuals and \nthose with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD).  Evidence for beneficial effects of parental \nexercise on the health status of their progeny is sparse and limited to non-\ndiseased individuals .  Here, we questioned whether maternal running interferes \nwith offspring\u2019s AD-like pathology and sought to decipher the possible underlying \nmechanisms in the transgenic (TG) CRND8 mouse model for AD.  \nMethods:  Maternal stimulation was provided by voluntary wheel running \ncompared to standard housing during pregnancy.   TG and wild type (WT) offspring \nwere housed in standard cages immediately after birth for five months.  After \nmonitoring the cognitive performance,  the brains of these mice were examined \nfor AD-related pathology and/or plasticity changes .  \nResults: Running  during pregnancy resulted in improved memory performance in \nhealthy and diseased offspring.  This effect was accompanied by  reduced beta-\namyloid (A \u03b2) plaque burden, mediated by decreased amyloidogenic processing \nof the amyloid precursor protein, diminished inflammation as indicated by \nreduced microgliosis and down-regulation of other p ro-inflammatory mediators , \nmitigated oxidative stress as nitro-tyrosine level declined,  and  improved \nneurovascular function by orchestrating different A \u03b2 transporters and increasing \nangiogenesis  in TG offspring.  Furthermore, plasticity changes were found not \nonly in TG but also in WT progeny.  \nConclusion: These results suggest that exercise during pregnancy provides long-\nlasting protection from neurodegeneration and improves cognitive performance \nand brain plasticity in the otherwise unstimulated progeny.  14Positive and negative monetary feedback learning in alcohol dependent patients\nMartina Rustemeier1, Juliane R\u00f6mling1, Christine Czybulka2, Gerhard Reymann3, \nIrene Daum1, Christian Bellebaum1\n1Inst. of Cogn. Neuroscience, Dept. of Neuropsychology, \nRuhr University Bochum, Germany\n2Dept. for Addiction, LWL-Hospital Dortmund, Germany\n3Faculty of Medicine, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany\nIntroduction:  Chronic and excessive consumption of alcohol leads to structural, \nphysiological and functional changes in multiple regions of the human brain \u2013 \nincluding the prefrontal cortex, the medial temporal lobe and the structures \nof the reward system \u2013 and influences cognitive, emotional and behavioral \ncapacities. As recent investigations revealed alcohol-associated changes in the \nprocessing of reward stimuli, the present study intended to examine the ability of \nalcohol dependent patients to learn probabilistic stimulus-reward contingencies \nand to transfer the acquired knowledge to new contexts. During transfer, the \npotential bias to learn from positive or negative feedback (monetary reward and \nnon-reward, respectively) was also assessed .\nMethods:  Twenty-four recently detoxified alcohol dependent patients and 20 \nhealthy control subjects performed a feedback learning task with monetary \nrewards. Acquisition of stimulus-response-outcome contingencies, transfer \nperformance and the tendency to learn from positive or negative feedback were \nassessed. The relationship between different learning parameters and clinical \nvariables related to drinking behavior as well as personality traits such as harm \navoidance, impulsivity and reaction inhibition were also examined.\nResults:  Alcohol dependent patients did not show a general learning deficit in \nthe acquisition phase. In the transfer phase, which was reached by 13 alcohol \ndependent patients and 15 healthy control subjects, the patients showed \ngenerally lower performance compared to controls. There was no between-group \ndifference with regard to better learning from positive or negative feedback. \nThe only near-significant (negative) correlation emerged for harm avoidance and \npositive learning in healthy controls. \nConclusions:  Our findings propose that feedback learning in alcohol dependent \npatients is altered compared to learning in healthy control subjects. But patients \ndo not show deficits in learning stimulus-outcome associations. Rather they are \nimpaired in the transfer of the learned associations to new contexts. This possibly \nreflects impaired declarative learning . Hence, we discuss possible dysfunctions in \nmedial temporal lobe and/or prefrontal brain structures.\n \nFunding:  Ministerium f\u00fcr Innovation, Wissenschaft und Forschung des Landes \nNordrhein-Westfalen; MIWF \u2013 grant number 334-415The impact of tDCS current strength on visual attention\nKatharina Moos1, Simone Vossel1, Ralph Weidner1, Roland Sparing1,2, \nGereon R. Fink1,2 \n1Cognitive Neurology Section, Institute of Neuroscience & Medicine (INM-3), \nResearch Centre J\u00fclich, 52425 J\u00fclich, Germany\n2Department of Neurology, University Hospital Cologne, 50924 Cologne, Germany\nObjectives:  Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a painless and \nnon-invasive stimulation technique with polarity-specific effects on cortical \nexcitability. In the present study we used cathodal tDCS to investigate the impact \nof different current strengths on visuo-spatial attention networks. Stimulating \nthe right intraparietal sulcus (rIPS), as a critical node of the dorsal fronto-parietal \nattention network, was expected to alter behavioural visual attention parameters \nas a function of stimulation strength.\nMethods:  20 healthy, right-handed subjects (mean age 25.86 years, 10 males) \nwere investigated in a within-subject design tDCS study, including four different \nsessions of stimulation (cathodal 1mA, 285.7A/m^2, 20min and sham, cathodal \n2mA, 571.4A/m^2, 20min and sham). Correct electrode placement over the rIPS \nand the contralateral orbita was assured using stereotactical neuronavigation. \nSubjects performed a partial report task and were asked to name target letters \ndefined by a relevant colour. A target was presented either on its own or \nsimultaneously with a second item, which could be either another target or a \ndistractor, in the same or opposite hemifield.\nResults:  In sham conditions, detection performance was highest for \ntarget alone conditions, while the presence of a second item (target \nor distractor) impaired performance. For displays comprising two \nitems, performance was poorer when the second item was a target \nand when both stimuli were presented within the same hemifield.  \nThe effect of tDCS versus sham stimulation on behavioural performance was \ntested with separate ANOVAs for the 1mA and 2mA conditions. For the two-item \nconditions, cathodal tDCS differentially modulated performance in conditions \nwith distractor stimuli. While this effect was restricted to distractors presented \nin the same hemifield in the 1mA condition (stimulation[cathodal/sham] x \ndisplay[same/other hemifield] x relevancy[target/distractor] interaction effect, \n(F(1,19)=6.785; p<0.02)), the 2mA tDCS effect was independent of the display \nconfiguration (stimulation[cathodal/sham]  x relevancy[target/distractor] \ninteraction effect, (F(1,19)=4.505; p<0.05)).\nConclusions: tDCS over rIPS modulates performance in the partial report \nparadigm, with qualitatively different effects depending upon current strength. \nThe data suggest a specific impact of cathodal tDCS on different cortical attention \nnetworks and contribute to a further understanding of the neurobiological effects \nof cathodal tDCS on cognitive processes.16Repair of Visual System Lesions by Neural Stem Cell Populations\nLars Roll1,2, Ulf T.

One strategy to improve function in the diseased \nCNS is the implantation of neural stem/progenitor cells. The visual cortex \nrepresents an appropriate model system for regeneration and plasticity studies \ndue to its convenient accessibility and the extensive knowledge about synaptic \nplasticity and reorganisation in this region. A particular emphasis will be given \nto extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules which are known modulators of cell \ndivision, migration, differentiation and integration. Before transplantation, an \nunderstanding of the ECM composition and of the involved glial cell types in the \nlesioned brain is essential. Here, we present the findings we made so far in the \nmouse visual cortex.\nMethods:  In a first step we established laser lesions of a defined size in the \nmurine visual cortex. Laser lesions in rat visual cortex are well described, while \nthe mouse system offers the advantage of manifold available knock out strains. \nThe ECM as well as the cells appearing in the penumbra are analyzed employing \nimmunohistochemistry and in situ  hybridization. Later, integration of transplanted \nneural stem/progenitor cells, labeled with the green fluorescent protein (GFP), \nand their effect on regeneration will be analyzed in vivo  and in vitro .\nResults:  The lesion site was characterized with regard to the different glial \nsubtypes involved in reactive gliosis and to the ECM composition three days after \nlesion. Glial subtypes expressing the markers nestin, glial fibrillary acidic protein \n(GFAP), vimentin or S100 b were not distributed equally, they rather showed typical \ndistributions. Three days after lesion, nestin was found near the lesion, GFAP \nshowed a widespread up-regulation, while vimentin was found in an intermediate \npattern. Subpopulations of cells expressed either one of the markers alone or \ncoexpressed different markers. An altered ECM composition was observed: The \nstem cell-related DSD-1-epitope was expressed on the surface of astroglia-like \nshaped cells near the lesion core. Tenascin-C, a glycoprotein expressed in the CNS \nduring development and after injury, was found up-regulated in the lesioned \ncortex in GFAP-positive astroglia.\nConclusions: Reactive gliosis was observed as expected after lesion. The spatial \ndistribution of different glial subtypes was examined, showing a specific \nexpression pattern of the markers nestin, GFAP, vimentin and S100 b. The \ncharacterization of the extracellular matrix composition showed the expression \nof the DSD-1-epitope and tenascin-C in the penumbra. GFAP and vimentin \nexpression is typical of reactive astrocytes, while nestin and the DSD-1-epitope 17are also characteristic of radial glia and progenitor cells. Therefore these cells are \ncandidates for neurosphere-forming progenitors observed postlesionally in the \nrat (Sirko et al ., 2009). In the light of a neurogenic potential described for cells \nin the penumbra, this suggests a model where some astroglial cells, probably \nexpressing the stem cell-related DSD-1-epitope, provide a potential intrinsic \nsource of newborn neurons. Transplantation of neural stem/progenitor cells into \nthe lesioned tissue will allow us to study their migration, differentiation and \nintegration as well as their effect on regeneration. Also here, the study will focus \non effects mediated by extracellular matrix molecules. \nFunding:  International Graduate School of Neuroscience (IGSN)18Screening for anorexia nervosa via measurement of serum leptin levels\n1F\u00f6cker M, 2Timmesfeld N, 1Scherag S, 3B\u00fchren K, 4Langkamp M, 5Burghardt R, \n2Dempfle A, 6Sheridan EM, 7de Zwaan M, 8Fleischhaker C, 9Herpertz S, 10Herzog \nW,  11Klampfl K, 12Zipfel S, 13Schade-Brittinger C, 2Herpertz-Dahlmann B, \n1Hebebrand J\n1Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University \nof Duisburg-Essen, Virchowstr. 174,  45147 Essen, Germany;  2Institute of Medical \nBiometry and Epidemiology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany;  3Department \nof Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Aachen, \nAachen, Germany; 4Mediagnost, Reutlingen, Germany; 5Department of Child \nand Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy,  Charit\u00e9-\nUniversit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin; 6The Zucker Hillside Hospital, Psychiatry \nResearch, Glen Oaks, NY, USA; 7Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and \nPsychotherapy, University Hospital of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany; 8Department \nof Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Freiburg, \nFreiburg, Germany; 9Clinic of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, \nLWL-University Clinic Bochum, Ruhr-University Bochum,  Bochum, Germany; \n10Department of Psychosomatic and General Internal Medicine, Centre for \nPsychosocial Medicine, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; \n11Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University \nof W\u00fcrzburg, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany; 12Department of Psychosomatic Medicine \nand Psychotherapy, Medical University Hospital T\u00fcbingen,  University T\u00fcbingen, \nT\u00fcbingen, Germany; 13Coordinating Centre for Clinical Trials (KKS), Philipps-\nUniversity, Marburg, Germany\nIntroduction:  Due to their sub-normally low fat mass, leptin levels in patients \nwith acute anorexia nervosa (AN) are well below reference levels for age and sex \nmatched controls. This hypoleptinemia entails endocrinological and behavioural \ncharacteristics observed in AN patients during starvation. \nMethods:  We aimed to study appropriateness of hypoleptinemia as a diagnostic \nmarker for AN by assessing sensitivity, specificity and likelihood-ratios for different \nreferral serum leptin levels for predicting anorexia nervosa and healthy leanness. \nFor prediction we additionally generated a score based on a multivariate logistic \nmodel including body mass index (BMI; kg/m\u00b2) and leptin level. For this purpose \nwe measured leptin levels in 74 female patients with acute AN upon admission for \ninpatient or outpatient treatment. Adolescent and adult patients were recruited \naccording to DSM-IV criteria from two multi-center studies. Additionally, leptin \nlevels were measured in 65 female healthy underweight students. \nResults:  Mean serum leptin level was significantly decreased in patients with AN \ncompared to underweight controls (0.87 \u00b1 0.90\u00b5g/L vs. 6.43 \u00b1 3.55\u00b5g/L, p<0.001). \nLeptin predicted AN independently of BMI; we confirmed a cut-off value in the \nrange of 2\u00b5g/L as having both high specificity and sensitivity. \nConclusions:  Hypoleptinemia represents a state marker of acute AN and is useful \nfor a laboratory-based diagnostic screening.19Metabolic profiling in patients with anorexia nervosa: Comparison of metabolic \nprofiles of acutely ill and weight recovered patients with anorexia nervosa reveals \nalterations of 29 out of 163 metabolites \n1F\u00f6cker M, 2Timmesfeld N, 3Singmann P, 3Wang-Sattler R, 4B\u00fchren K, 5Egberts K, \n6Fleischhaker C, 3Illig T, 4Herpertz-Dahlmann B, 1Hebebrand J\n1Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, \nUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Germany\n2Institute of Medical Biometry and Epidemiology, Philipps-University, Marburg, \nGermany\n3Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen , German Research Center \nfor Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany\n4Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, \nRWTH Aachen University, Germany\n5Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of \nW\u00fcrzburg, Germany\n6Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of \nFreiburg, Germany\nIntroduction:  Metabolomics serves as a powerful tool to identify biochemical \npathways affected by diseases and as a link between genotype and phenotype. \nStarvation represents an extreme state of an organism and entails numerous \nendocrinological and metabolic adaptations. The large-scale application of \nmetabolomics to patients with acute anorexia nervosa (AN) could lead to the \nidentification of both state markers characteristic of the starvation associated \nwith this mental disorder and trait markers which are specific for anorexia \nnervosa itself. Whereas previous studies have revealed alterations of single amino \nacids and fatty-acids of patients with AN in comparison to healthy controls, novel \nmetabolomics technology has not yet been applied to this eating disorder. \nMethods:  We studied 163 metabolites in 29 patients with AN in the acute stage \nof starvation (T0) and after weight gain (T1). Metabolite concentrations that \ndiffered significantly between the acute and weight recovered states were then \ncompared to concentrations obtained in 25 age and gender matched controls; we \nhypothesized that concentrations are similar in weight recovered patients and \ncontrols. \nResults:  Twenty nine of the metabolite serum levels were significantly different \nbetween the acute stage (T0) and after weight gain (T1). Interestingly, for most of \nthese metabolites concentrations of controls differed more strongly from those \nof AN patients after weight gain than at the acute stage of starvation. \nConclusion:  We conclude that AN entails profound and long lasting alterations \nof a number of serum metabolites; further studies are warranted to distinguish \nbetween state and trait related alterations and to establish diagnostic sensitivity \nand specificity of the thus altered metabolome. 20Activation of the dentate nucleus in a verb generation task: A 7T MRI study.\nMarkus Th\u00fcrling, Michael K\u00fcper, Roxana Stefanescu, Stefan Maderwald, \nElke R Gizewski, Mark E Ladd, Dagmar Timmann\nDepartment of Neurology, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany; Erwin L. \nHahn Institute for Magnetic Resonance , University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany\nBackground:  There is increasing evidence of a topographic organization within \nthe human cerebellar cortex for motor and non-motor functions. Likewise, a \nsubdivision of the dentate nucleus in a more dorsal and rostral motor domain and \na more ventral and caudal non-motor domain has been proposed by Dum and \nStrick (2003) based on anatomical studies in monkey. In humans, however, very \nlittle is known about topographic organization within the dentate nucleus.\nMethods:  Activation of the dentate nucleus in a verb generation task was \nexamined in young and healthy subjects using ultra-highfield 7T functional \nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with its increase in signal-to-noise ratio. \nData of 17 subjects were included in statistical analysis. Subjects were asked to (i) \nread words (nouns) aloud presented on a screen, (ii) silently read the same nouns, \n(iii) silently generate the appropriate verbs to the same nouns and (iv) to silently \nrepeat the names of the months. A block design was used. For image processing, \na recently developed region of interest (ROI) driven normalization method of the \ndentate nuclei was applied.\nResults:  Activation related to motor speech (contrast aloud reading minus silent \nreading) was strongest in the rostral parts of the dentate nucleus. Dorsorostral \nactivations were present bilaterally. Activation related to verb generation \n(contrast verb generation minus silent reading) was found in the ventrocaudal \nparts of the dentate nucleus on the right.\nDiscussion: The present findings are in good accordance with the anatomical data \nin monkeys and suggest that the human dentate nucleus can be subdivided into \na rostral and more dorsal motor domain and a ventrocaudal non-motor domain.\nFunding:  Supported by DFG TI 239/9-1 and Marie Curie Initial Training Network \n\u201cCerebellar-Cortical Control: Cells, Circuits, Computation and Clinic\u201d.21Crossmodal working memory performance in professional musicians and non-\nmusicians\nChristine Friedmann1, Gordian Scholz1, Elke Gizewski2, Michael Forsting2, \nBoris Suchan1\n1Inst. of Cognitive Neuroscience, Dept. of Neuropsychology, Ruhr University Bochum, \nBochum, Germany\n2Inst. of Diagnostic & Interventional Radiology & Neuroradiology, University \nHospital Essen, Essen, Germany\nIntroduction:  An influential model on working memory suggests that visual \ninput is automatically transferred into its phonological code to support rehearsal. \nThis transformation process has been investigated in a former study, where we \ninvestigated crossmodal processing (visual and auditory) in working memory. We \ncould demonstrate that the matching of visual and auditory stimuli activated the \nprimary auditory suggesting a recoding of visual stimuli when being compared \nwith their auditory probe. To further study crossmodal processing in both \ndirections (auditory - visual, visual - auditory) professional musicians reflect \na perfect population because they are trained in reading musical notes and \ntranscribing auditory music into its written form.  \nMethods:  15 professional musicians and 15 non-musicians performed a new \ndesigned 2-back task with changing and non-changing modalities namely visual \nand auditory rhythm pattern. Inverse efficiency scores served as a measure of \nbehavioral performance. Brain activations were assessed using event-related \nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).  \nResults:  The professional musicians did not differ significantly in the uni- and \ncrossmodal trials of the 2-back task on the behavioral level. The non-musicians\u2019 \nperformance was significantly lower in unimodal auditory and crossmodal \nauditory-visual conditions. Imaging data revealed in accordance with recent \nstudies the activation of the primary auditory cortex during matching of visual \nand auditory stimuli in both groups. In contrast, when matching of auditory and \nvisual stimuli was required, both groups activated extrastriate visual areas along \nthe ventral stream, namely the lateral occipital complex and the fusiform gyrus \nextended into the cerebellum, but only the professional musicians additionally \nactivated the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).\nConclusions:  Our findings support and strengthen the consideration of an \nactive recoding rather than rehearsal process of crossmodal material in general. \nFurther, common and shared neural networks of crossmodal processing in the \ntwo populations were identified: Both groups showed a transformation of visual \ninput into auditory information in the primary auditory cortex (which might be \na basic skill) and activations in the ventral stream during transformation of its \ncounter piece. But only professional musicians were able to use top-down control \nto solve the latter task as reflected by activation of right DLPFC (this process of \ntranscription has to be intensely trained during musical education). This finding 22yields empirical evidence that expertise in musicians may lead to far transfer in \nworking memory domain and to the use of more efficient neuronal networks \ndue to intense and extensive training from early childhood. Hence, professional \nmusicians provide an ideal model for brain plasticity.23The Amphibian Olfactome\nAdnan S. Syed, Saskia Faassen and Sigrun I. Korsching\nSystem Neurobiology lab, Institute for Genetics, University of Cologne\nBackground: The sense of smell helps animal species to evade predators, localize \nprey and recognize viable mates. Odors are a rich source of information, and are \nperceived by sophisticated olfactory systems, that have evolved over time. In \nhumans, memoirs, thoughts, emotions, and associations are more readily reached \nthrough the sense of smell than through any other channel, suggesting that \nolfactory processing may differ considerably from processing in other sensory \nmodalities. The molecular age in olfaction initiated in 1991 with the discovery of \na large multigene family of olfactory receptors in rat by Linda Buck and Richard \nAxel (Buck and Axel, 1991).\nMethods: Our study focuses on Western clawed frog ( Xenopus tropicalis ), a diploid \norganism that can be considered an evolutionary bridge between aquatic and \nterrestrial life. Several distinct differences between teleost and tetrapods olfactory \nreceptor repertories have been reported, and a stringent analysis of the olfactory \nsystem of early and partially still aquatic tetrapods such as Xenopus  should \nthrow light on the evolutionary events leading to this transitions. Two olfactory \nreceptors vomeronasal type1 and vomeronasal type 2 (V1R,V2R) receptor families \nof Xenopus tropicalis were retrieved, using homology data mining on publically \navailable genomic databases for the vomeronasal type 1 (V1Rs) and vomeronasal \ntype 2 (V2Rs) receptors families followed by Phylogenetic analysis. We have also \nbegun to analyze the expression of olfactory receptors by in situ hybridization of \ntadpole olfactory epithelium.\nResults: We identified 23 vomeronasal type 1 (V1Rs) and more than 500 \nvomeronasal type 2 (V2Rs) olfactory receptors, considerably more than previously \npublished (Saraiva and Korsching, 2007; Ji et al, 2009) and for V2Rs the largest \nrepertoire of any species analyzed so far.\nDiscussion: Working with Xenopus tropicalis  as a model organism can help us to \nunderstand the evolutionary history of the olfactory system in vertebrates. Our \nanalysis shows:\n\u2022\t   X. tropicalis has undergone massive expansion in the V2R gene family, \npresumably to accommodate between water to air odor detection.\n\u2022\t   X. tropicalis V1R represent the transition between the teleost and \ntetrapods V1R repertoire, as they underwent moderate species specific \nexpansion. \n\u2022\t  In comparison to fish, Xenopus have formed an additional olfactory \norgan called vomeronasal organ (VNO), which however houses only one \nof the receptor family out of two known to be expressed in mammalian \nVNO.\nFunding:  SPP-1392 and IGSDHD24Nutzen einer automatisierten MRT-Bedienungssoftware f\u00fcr \nKopfuntersuchungen \nMoenninghoff C1, Umutlu L1, Sombetzki A1, Ladd ME1,2, Lauenstein TC1,  \nSchlamann M1\n1 Institut f\u00fcr diagnostische und interventionelle Radiologie und Neuroradiologie, \nUniversit\u00e4tsklinikum Essen\n2 Erwin L.

All of these factors promote neural activation, \nsignalling and metaplasticity, which in turn modify the persistency, quality and \nform of the memory engram. EE comprises an experimental model of the effects \nof an optimised social, sensory and motoric environment on the brain. EE causes \nprofound changes in neuronal signalling and levels of excitation and plasticity \nthroughout the entire central nervous system. Little is known, however, about the \ncellular basis of EE and, in particular, which intracellular cascades are altered due \nto EE. Given its participation ina key intracellular cascades leading to activation \nof the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), we investigated whether \nbrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) contributes to the enhancement of \nsynaptic plasticity elicited by EE.  \nMethods:  In order to study whether BDNF-Trk signalling is modified following \nEE in the hippocampal CA1 region, mice that had a modified expression of \nBDNF (BDNF+/- -transgenic mice) were used. Immediately after weaning, male \nlittermates were housed in EE together.  After three weeks of exposure to EE, the \nmice\u2019s short-term and long-term non-spatial memory was tested by an object \nrecognition test. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was assessed in the hippocampus \nusing hippocampal slices. Field excitatory postsynaptc potentials (fEPSPs) were \nevoked in the CA1 Stratum radiatum by stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals.\nResults:   Application of HFS at 100 Hz (1 train of 100 pulses at 100 Hz) resulted \nin LTP. LTP of enriched mice showed higher magnitudes in comparison to non-\nenriched mice.  BDNF+/- mice showed decreased LTP in comparison to control mice, \nwhereas LTP in enriched BDNF+/- mice was not different from controls. Twenty four \nhours after first exposure to the objects, mice of all groups were able to recognize \nthe object. However, BDNF+/- non-enriched mice, in contrast to all other groups, \ncould not remember the object after one week of first exposure to the object.\nConclusion: These data indicate that EE has an enhancing LTP and facilitates \nlong-term memory in transgenic BDNF+/- mice.  On the other hand, our data \nsuggest BDNF contributes to synaptic modifications that contribute to  synaptic  \nfacilitation in EE.28Increasing or impairing - which influence has stress on memories of the stressful \nsituation?\nUta S. Wiemers1,2, Daniela Schoofs1, Magdalena M. Sauvage2 ,3, Tanja C. Hamacher-\nDang1, Oliver T. Wolf1,2\n1Department of Cognitive Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, Ruhr-University \nBochum, Germany\n2International Graduate School of Neuroscience, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany\n3Functional Architecture of Memory unit, Mercator Research Group, Faculty of \nMedicine, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany\nBackground: The fact that learning and memory performance is modulated by \nstress and thereof resulting hormonal changes is well documented. Depending \non the timing of the stressor in relation to encoding, consolidation and retrieval, \nstress can either have enhancing or impairing effects on learning and memory. \nMost experimental studies establishing and supporting these findings have \ntested memory performance under stress for previously learned material, often \nunrelated to the stressor.  Only few studies investigated the influence of stress \non the memory of the stressful episode itself. However, this seems to be highly \nrelevant considering patients suffering from long lasting and strong memories of \nstressful and traumatic events.\nThus, we aimed to investigate in an experimental study which aspects of a stressful \nepisode are remembered. We expected participants exposed to a psychosocial \nstressor remembering central details of the stressor better than participants who \nwere not stressed.\nMethods: Sixty-three participants took part in the study. Half of them were \nexposed to a laboratory psychosocial stressor (modified version of the Trier \nSocial Stress Test, TSST), the other half was exposed to a newly developed, non-\nstressful control condition (friendly-TSST). During both conditions, participants \nwere exposed to stimuli of different modalities. These included an ambient odor, \nvisual stimuli in the form of office objects and a word list. Hormonal and affective \nchanges due to the stressor were assessed before and after the manipulation. The \nnext day, participants engaged in several unexpected recall and recognition tasks. \nResults: As expected, stressed participants showed higher negative and lower \npositive affect as well as higher salivary cortisol levels after the TSST compared to \nnot stressed participants. Stressed participants recognized objects central to the \nstressful situation better than not stressed participants. The ambient odor was \nrecognized better by stressed participants as well. In contrast, the word list was \nrememered better by participants from the control group. \nConclusion: Visual items central to the situation are remembered better when \nthe situation is stressful than when it is not. Odors seem to play a special role \nfor stressful memory processes possibly reflecting the fact that olfactory \ninformation reaches the amygdala without thalamic gating. The word list, which \nwas presented at the end of the stress or control situation apparently was not 29perceived as central to the situation by stressed participants and was thus \nremembered poorer by them.

Although \nplacebo treatment is part of any placebo-controlled study and is often used in \nclinical practice, it remains unclear if and to what extent subjectively perceived \ntreatment is associated with responses to placebo treatment. Therefore, we \nanalyzed data from an experimental placebo analgesia pain paradigm using \nvisceral pain stimuli to test the hypothesis that perceived treatment (i.e., drug vs. \nplacebo) affects behavioural and neural responses to placebo. \nMethods:  In this fMRI study, N = 36 healthy subjects received painful rectal \ndistensions. To model the situation in a typical placebo-controlled trial, subjects \nwere instructed that the probability of receiving a potent analgesic drug was 50 \n%. In reality, all subjects received saline. Following repeated distensions in the \nscanner, subjects completed visual analogue scales (VAS) assessing perceived pain, \ndiscomfort, and urge to defecate. In addition, participants indicated subjectively \nperceived treatment, i.e., \u201cpotent analgesic\u201d;  \u201csaline solution / placebo\u201d or \u201cI do \nnot know\u201d . All analyses compared the perceived drug treatment group and \nthe perceived placebo treatment group. To detect signal differences in blood \noxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses during pain anticipation and pain, \na two sample t contrast was used in a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis. \nResults:  Of the total N = 36 subjects, N = 20 (55.6 %) believed that they had \nreceived a placebo, N = 13 (36.1 %) felt that they had received a potent analgesic \ndrug, and N = 3 (8.3 %; excluded from analyses) were unsure.  In the perceived \ndrug treatment group, rectal pain-induced discomfort ratings were significant \nlower when compared to the perceived placebo treatment group (p < 0.05). \nFurther, the perceived drug treatment group revealed significant lower activation \nin the insula (t = 4.99, pFWE < 0.05), the posterior cingulate cortex (t = 4.63, pFWE \n< 0.05), and the anterior cingulate cortex (t = 4.15, pFWE < 0.05) when compared \nto the perceived placebo treatment group during cued pain anticipation. During \npain, BOLD-signal of the anterior cingulate cortex was significant lower in the \nperceived drug treatment group (t = 4.41, pFWE < 0.05). 31Discussion: In this placebo analgesia paradigm, retrospectively assessed \ntreatment perceptions were associated with reduced pain-induced discomfort \nand reduced neural activation in subjects who believed that they had received a \npotent painkiller. These findings may reflect a reduction in pain amplification by \nemotions of fear and anxiety in placebo responders. A more refined understanding \nof the role of individual treatment expectations has multiple implications for our \nunderstanding of placebo responses and the design of clinical trials involving \nplacebos.  \nFunding: DFG EL 236/8-1 32Retrieval of high-level and low-level chunks in hierarchically structured stimulus \nsequences\nAnne B. K\u00fchn1, 2, D. Yves von Cramon1, Iring Koch3, Ricarda I. Schubotz1, 2\n1Max Planck Institute for Neurological Research, Cologne\n2Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-University, Institute of Psychology, M\u00fcnster\n3RWTH Aachen University, Institute of Psychology, Aachen\nBackground:  The fundamental cognitive process of chunking enhances memory \ncapacity and reduces cognitive load by the integration of bits into bigger units, \nso-called chunks. When two or more low-level chunks (chunks of bits) are put \ntogether, high-level chunks evolve (chunks of chunks). By this integration, which \ncan be repeated on further levels, hierarchical structures with increasing chunking \nlevels develop. The main goal of the present fMRI study was to investigate, which \nneural correlates subserve the retrieval of increasing chunking levels.\nMethods:  Eighteen healthy volunteers participated in the study. They were \nrequired to learn by trial and error and to retrieve 16-digit stimulus sequences with \nthree chunking levels in a two-choice paradigm. Behavioral as well as functional \ndata were analyzed time-locked to chunk-boundaries, i.e. first elements of chunks. \nThe neural responses entered a parametric statistical analysis. \nResults:  Behavioral analysis revealed that se lection times increased with increasing \nchunking levels. Neural responses time-locked to chunk boundaries of each level \nrevealed the frontopolar cortex (Brodmann Area (BA) 10) to be preferentially \nactivated in the retrieval of high-level chunks while frontolateral areas along the \nleft inferior frontal sulcus (IFS) were mainly activated in the retrieval of low-level \nchunks. \nDiscussion: Findings corroborate the notion of a functional posterior-to-anterior \ngradation of the prefrontal cortex. In particular, activation of the IFS indicate \nthat the retrieval of low-level chunks points to item by item selection among \nmaintained information and to the prediction of object sequences, whereas \nactivation of BA 10 indicates that the retrieval of high-level chunks is related to \nplanning of complex future events and to cognitive branching. \nFunding:  Max Planck Society33Common and distinct mechanisms for mental rotation of external objects, body \nparts and complex scenes?\nMarc Dalecki, Uwe Hoffmann, Otmar Bock\nInst. of Physiology and Anatomy, German Sport University Cologne, Germany\nBackground:  The existence of distinct mechanisms for different mental-rotation \ntasks seems to be supported by neuroimaging studies which found that object, \nhand and whole-body rotation activates different brain areas. However, the \nactivation pattern differed not only between stimulus categories, but also \nbetween author groups using the same category, and results and conclusions \nwere inconsistent. Therefore, the present study introduces a fresh approach to \ncompare mental rotation with three different stimuli: letters, body parts and \ncomplex scenes. We administer all three categories of mental-rotation stimuli \nto the same  subjects using the same  experimental procedure, and analyze not \nonly across-subject means but also individual differences: if those subjects who \nperformed well with one stimulus category also excel with another category, this \nwould argue against completely distinct mechanisms. To our knowledge, this is \nthe first study which compares all three stimulus categories.  \nMethods:  24 subjects saw letters judging whether they were mirror-reversed or \nnot (task LETTER), saw pictures of a hand indicating whether it was a right or a \nleft one (task HAND), and saw drawings of a person at a table on which a weapon \nand a rose laid and deciding whether the weapon was right or left (task SCENE). \nMaterial could be in canonical orientation or rotated by up to 180\u00b0. Our analyses \nfocused on intra-subject correlations between reaction times of the different \ntasks.\nResults:  We found reaction times for stimuli in canonical orientation co-varied in \nHAND and LETTER, the increase of reaction times with increasing object rotation \nco-varied in HAND and SCENE, and reaction times for 180\u00b0 rotations co-varied \nbetween all tasks. \nDiscussion: We suggest that basic processes like visual perception and decision-\nmaking are distinct for scenes versus letters and body parts, that the mechanism \nfor mental rotation of letters is distinct from that for mental self- and body part \nrotation, and suggest an extra mechanism for 180\u00b0 rotations, shared among all \ntasks; this mechanism could exploit the geometrical equivalence between a 180\u00b0 \nrotation and double axis inversion.\nFunding:  German Aerospace Center (DLR) and German Ministry for Research and \nTechnology (grant 50WB0726).34Evaluation of the role of CEACAM1 in the developing neonatal rat brain\nS Prager1,2, BB Singer2, M Keller1, I Bendix1, GW Schlager1, R Herrmann1, S Erg\u00fcn2, \nU Felderhoff-M\u00fcser1\n1Dept. of Paediatrics 1 - Neonatology, University Hospital Essen, Germany \n2Dept. of Anatomy, University Hospital Essen, Germany\nIntroduction: Encephalopathy of prematurity subsumes the two main \nneuropathological disorders of preterm white matter injury and neuronal/\naxonal disease. Factors such as hypoxia\u2013ischemia, drug exposure, hyperoxia and \nmaternal/neonatal inflammation are causal. Particularly with regards to infection/\ninflammation a significant role of CEACAM1 in different diseases has been \nproposed. CEACAM1, the founder molecule of the family of carcinoembryonic \nantigen-related cell adhesion molecules, is a glycoprotein which is existent in \ndifferent isoforms influencing distinct signaling cascades. It contributes i.e. \nto morphogenesis of new blood vessels, cell proliferation, apoptosis, insulin \nmetabolism, infection and inflammation.  An expression of CEACAM1 was also \nfound in endothelial cells of developing rat brain but its role in neuronal and glial \ncells is not yet investigated. \nThe aim of the current study is to evaluate the physiological regulation of \nCEACAM1 expression in the developing brain in newborn rats. In a second step \nwe plan to evaluate the role of CEACAM1 in a rat model of encephalopathy of \nprematurity caused by hyperoxia and inflammation.\nMethods:  Brains of Wistar rats were analyzed from day 1 to 15. CEACAM1 protein \nexpression was detected in serial brain sections by immunohistochemistry. \nAdditionally, double labeling of CEACAM1 and brain cell subpopulation \nmarkers such as myelin basic protein (MPB), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), \nneurofilament and nestin was performed. Furthermore, RNA from brain \nhemispheres was isolated to detect the different isoforms of rat CEACAM1. \nImmunocytochemistry for CEACAM1 was performed on cultured mixed glia cells, \npre-oligodendrocytes and mature oligodendrocytes with and without stimulation \nby CEACAM1 ligands. \nResults: CEACAM1 expression was detected in broad areas of the brain beginning \non day 5 in brain stem and afterwards in the forebrain. CEACAM1 is expressed on \noligodendrocytes, a finding that was confirmed on cultivated primary brain cells. \nCEACAM1 expression showed a close spatiotemporary connection to myelination. \nOn RNA level, expression of the CEACAM1-4L and -S splice variants as well as the \nsoluble CEACAM1-4C2 splice variant were detected. \nConclusion: Our results show for the first time an expression of CEACAM1 in \noligodendrocytes in the developing brain. This is of special interest as one major \ncomponent of encephalopathy of prematurity is a myelination disorder. Thus, \nprecise definition of the role of CEACAM1 in myelination is content of our current \ninvestigations.35Impact of neonatal Propofol anaesthesia on long-term neurodevelopmental \noutcome\nG.W. Schlager1, T. Karen1, M. Keller1, U. Felderhoff-M\u00fcser1\n1Klinik f\u00fcr Kinderheilkunde I - Neonatologie, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Essen, Essen, \nDeutschland\nBackground:  Perinatal brain damage is a leading cause of disability and even \ndeath in preterm born infants, which comprise of 5 -11% of all live births. Clinical \nstudies have shown, that these children are at higher risk to suffer from cognitive \nimpairments, ranging from cerebral palsy to deficits such as attention deficit and \nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD). At the exception of inflammation and hypoxia-\nischaemia, major factors in the aetiology of perinatal brain injury, preterms are \nadditionally challenged by their unphysiologic environment and iatrogenous \ninterventions. In order to minimise pain and discomfort, these interventions \noften include the use of anaesthetic agents, such as Propofol. Recent reports, \nhovever, raised concern about the safety of these drugs. Animals studies indicated \nthat an administration of Propofol during the period of synaptogenesis, induces \nneural apoptotic cell death by a, so far, poorly understood mechanism. Especially \nthe resulting long-term effect on neurodevelopment and cognitive function is \nuncertain. Aim:  In this study we investigated the neurodevelopmental outcome \nof Propofol sedation in adolescent and adult aged animals to supplement our \nongoing investigations assessing the neurodegenerative properties of this drug. \nMethods:  Six day old Wistar rats (P6) were randomly assigned to receive either \nthree i.p. injections of 30 mg/kg Propofol or 0.9% NaCl solution every 90 min. \nIn order to assess activity (locomotion, travel distance, and speed) and anxiety \nrelated behaviour as well as the nature and rate of habituation, an open field \ntest (OFT) was performed on four consecutive days at two time points (P30, \nP120). Memory function was assessed by the novel object recognition test which \nsubsequently followed the OFT both time points using an inter-trial interval of 6 \nand 12 hrs. \nResults:  We were able to observe increased levels of activity (locomotion and \ntravel distance) in Propofol treated animals on the first day of the open field test \n(P30). This increase however was only transient, as both parameters dropped to \nlevels observed in control animals on the second day and were found to be similar \non the following days, which was persistent up to P124. We therefore hypothesise \nthat the hyperactive response of Propofol treated animals was triggered by the \nnovel environment on the first day of observation. There was no significant \ndifference in the average velocity of the animals movements indicating that the \nincreased travel distance was mainly influenced by the increased time in motion. \nIn contrast to a previous report, we observed no impairment in the animals \nability to habituate to the testing procedure. The assessment of memory function \nrevealed that, at 30 days of age, both groups were able to remember a previously \npresented object after 6 hrs but failed to do so after 24 hrs. At the age of 120 days \nboth groups failed to clearly distinguish between the old and the new object after \nboth intervals. 36Conclusion: We observed a change in the activity of adolescent animals at the age \nof 30 days as expressed by a transient increase in locomotion and travel distance \non the very first day of observation. These changes may be a hint that the use \nof Propofol during the neonatal period increases the risk to suffer from ADHD in \nadolescence. We therefore suggest that the long-term behavioural development \nfollowing neonatal sedation with Propofol should be scrutinised in clinical trials.37Sphingosin-receptor modulation in hyperoxia-mediated perinatal brain damage\nI. Bendix1, X.-L. Hou1, R. Herrmann1, K. Kempe1, M. Keller1, U. Felderhoff-Mueser1\n1Department of Pediatrics I/ Neonatology, University Clinic Essen, Essen, Germany\nBackground and aims : \nSubstantial neurologic morbidity occurs in survivors of premature birth. \nExperimental studies revealed that oxygen, which is widely used in neonatal \nmedicine for resuscitation and treatment of pulmonary hypertension, triggers \nwidespread neural apoptosis leading to gray and white matter damage. \nWithin the last years it became evident that modulation of the sphingosine-1-\nphosphate (S1P)-receptor system, by the S1P analogue FTY720, not only affects \nimmune responses but also shows neuroprotective capacities. Since we recently \ndemonstrated a detrimental role of elevated oxygen-concentrations (80 %, \nhyperoxia) to the developing white matter in vitro and in vivo, we were now \ninterested whether FTY720 might protect developing oligodendrocytes against \nhyperoxia-mediated cell death and how S1P-receptors are regulated in this \nexperimental setup.\nMethods :\nPrimary oligodendrocyte precursor (pOLN) cells were purified from mixed \nglia cultures, obtained from two-day old Wistar rat brains, by using the shake-\noff method. Purified cells were cultured 5-7 days under non-differentiating \nconditions. Hyperoxia-mediated modulations of S1P-receptors were determined \nby real time PCR (RT-PCR). To investigate the effect of FTY720 cells were treated \nwith different concentrations of FTY720 (10, 100, 1000 nM or vehicle). Cell \ndeath was investigated by biochemical methods, immunocytochemistry and \nflowcytometry. \nResults :\nWe observed a marked induction of S1P-receptor mRNA-expression after 24 h \nhyperoxia that is to some extend counterregulated by the S1P analogue FTY720. \nMoreover, we observed a partial inhibition of hyperoxia-mediated apoptosis by \nFTY720. As such, LDH release was reduced in FTY-treated cells as compared to \ncontrol cells. Flowcytometry analysis further revealed that the number of pro-\napoptotic cells is reduced in the presence of this substance. \nConclusion : Our data imply that the modulation of the S1P receptor system might \nbe highly relevant for hyperoxia induced white matter damage in the neonatal \nbrain and therefore might present a potential therapeutic target. The next step \nwill be to test our hypothesis in the in vivo  model of hyperoxia. 38Evaluation eines Modells zur transkraniellen Gleichstromstimulation in der Ratte\nMeike Keuters, Maureen Walberer, Roland Sparing, Michael Schroeter, Maria \nAdele Rueger\nKlinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Neurologie, Uniklinik K\u00f6ln\nEinleitung: Die transkranielle Gleichstromstimulation (tDCS) wird im Rahmen \nvon Studien beim Menschen eingesetzt, um unter anderem funktionelle Defizite \nnach einem Schlaganfall zu behandeln. Dabei ist die genaue Wirkungsweise \nder Therapie bislang nur unzureichend bekannt, unter anderem erscheint eine \nBeeinflussung neuroinflammatorischer Prozesse m\u00f6glich. Die aktuelle Studie \nhatte das Ziel, die Wirkungsweise der tDCS auf zellul\u00e4re inflammatorische \nProzesse in der Ratte zu evaluieren. Es sollte eine Stromst\u00e4rke gefunden und ein \nZeitraum bestimmt werden, bei der es zu einer inflammatorischen Reaktion des \nstimulierten Gewebes, nicht jedoch zu einer strukturellen L\u00e4sion des Gehirns \nkommt.\nMethode: Insgesamt sieben Ratten wurden mittels tDCS kathodal stimuliert, \ndavon zwei Tiere einmalig mit 1mA \u00fcber 30 min, und f\u00fcnf Tiere t\u00e4glich \n(repetitiv) mit je 500\u00b5A f\u00fcr 15 min \u00fcber einen Zeitraum von f\u00fcnf Tagen. Sieben \nTage nach der ersten tDCS wurden die Tiere unter tiefer Narkose dekapitiert \nund die Gehirne histologisch weiter aufbereitet. Die Hirnschnitte wurden \nzur Beurteilung der Morphologie mit H\u00e4matoxylin/Eosin (HE) gef\u00e4rbt. Zur \nBeurteilung der Mikrogliaaktivierung wurde deren Oberfl\u00e4chenantigen CD11b \nimmunhistochemisch angef\u00e4rbt. Die Expressionsst\u00e4rke von CD11b wurde auf \nder Basis einer Bildausschnitts-Analyse als Surrogatparameter f\u00fcr das Ausma\u00df \nder Mikrogliaaktivierung quantifiziert und mit der kontralateralen Hemisph\u00e4re \nverglichen. \nErgebnisse: Die einmalig mit starker Stromst\u00e4rke (1mA) stimulierten Ratten \nzeigten klare strukturelle L\u00e4sionen unterschiedlicher Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, eines der Tiere \nwies zus\u00e4tzlich eine rechtsseitige Hemiparese auf. Die Ratten der niedriger \ndosierten (500\u00b5A), daf\u00fcr \u00fcber f\u00fcnf Tage repetitiven tDCS, wiesen dagegen keine \nstrukturellen Gewebssch\u00e4digungen auf. Mit Hilfe der quantitativen Bildanalyse \nkonnte dennoch eine signifikante Aktivierung von Mikroglia in der stimulierten \nHemisph\u00e4re nachgewiesen werden. Mit diesen Untersuchungen konnten wir \nsomit erstmalig zeigen, dass tDCS inflammatorische Reaktionen im Gehirn \nhervorrufen kann.\nSchlussfolgerung: Die Etablierung eines nicht-l\u00e4sionellen Modells zur \ntranskraniellen Gleichstromstimulation in der Ratte war erfolgreich, auch \nrepetitive Stimulationen konnten bei entsprechend gew\u00e4hlter Stromst\u00e4rke \nvorgenommen werden, ohne strukturelle L\u00e4sionen zu verursachen. Dar\u00fcber \nhinaus konnten wir erstmals eine durch tDCS ausgel\u00f6ste neuro-inflammatorische \nReaktion im Gehirn nachweisen. Diese Methode wird in zuk\u00fcnftigen Studien \nhelfen, die genauen Wirkmechanismen der bereits in klinischen Studien \nangewandten tDCS zu entschl\u00fcsseln.39Kognitive Funktionsst\u00f6rungen bei chronischer Niereninsuffizienz\nDalis, M1, Todica O1, Gronewold, J1, Volsek M2, Kribben A2, Bruck H2, Hermann DM1\n1 Neurologische Klinik, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Essen\n2 Nephrologische Klinik, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Essen\nEinleitung: Weltweit leiden mehr als 500 Mio. Menschen an chronischer \nNiereninsuffizienz (CKD), im Zuge der \u201ealternden Gesellschaft\u201c wird die Pr\u00e4valenz \nvon CKD weiter ansteigen. Zahlreiche Studien konnten bereits kognitive \nFunktionsst\u00f6rungen bei CKD-Patienten aufzeigen. Es bestehen erste Hinweise \nauf eine Verbindung zwischen komorbiden kardiovaskul\u00e4ren Risikofaktoren \nund kognitiven Einschr\u00e4nkungen bei CKD-Patienten - die genaue Natur der \nVerbindung zwischen Niereninsuffizienz und kognitiven Funktionen bleibt jedoch \nbislang unklar, da selten betrachtet wurde, inwieweit CKD per se mit kognitiven \nDefiziten einhergeht. \nMethoden: In der  vorliegenden Studie wird diese Fragestellung n\u00e4her untersucht, \nindem Patienten mit CKD Stadium 3-4 (CKD 3-4) im Rahmen einer prospektiven \nUntersuchung mit Patienten  mit CKD im Endstadium unter Dialyse (CKD \n5) und einer Kontrollgruppe (KG) mit kardiovaskul\u00e4ren Risikofaktoren, aber \nohne CKD in Bezug auf ihre Leistung in verschiedenen neuropsychologischen \nTests sowie klinischen und Labordaten verglichen werden. Au\u00dferdem wird \nregressionsanalytisch betrachtet, wie kardiovaskul\u00e4re Risikofaktoren die \nkognitive Leistung beeinflussen und ob hierbei Unterschiede zwischen den \nGruppen bestehen. \nErgebnisse: CKD-Patienten zeigten in fast allen neuropsychologischen Tests \neine signifikant schlechtere Leistung im Vergleich zur KG. Patienten mit CKD \n5 wiesen zudem eine signifikant schlechtere Leistung im visuokonstruktiven \nVerm\u00f6gen sowie einen niedrigeren Wert der globalen Kognition (Anzahl \nunterdurchschnittlicher Testleistungen) auf verglichen mit CKD 3-4 und der KG. \nBedeutsame Pr\u00e4diktoren f\u00fcr die kognitive Leistung bei CKD 3-4 waren Fibrinogen, \nParathormon und Intima-Media-Dicke der Arteria carotis communis. Bei Patienten \nmit CKD 5 hingegen wurde die kognitive Leistung vor allem durch HbA1c und BMI \nvorhergesagt. \nSchlussfolgerung: CKD ist mit spezifischen kognitiven Defiziten verbunden, \nwobei eine st\u00e4rkere Einschr\u00e4nkung der Nierenfunktion mit einer st\u00e4rkeren \nBeeintr\u00e4chtigung kognitiver Funktionen verbunden ist. Unterschiede bestehen \nauch bei der Vorhersage der kognitiven Leistung, was auf verschiedene \u00c4tiologien \nkognitiver Defizite hinweist.40The role of intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery in addition to \nclinical risk factors in stroke prediction \nJanine Gronewold,1 Dirk M.

However, results of \nrecent studies suggested that additional assessment of subclinical atherosclerotic \nmarkers might improve risk prediction and help to optimize prevention strategies. \nThe present study investigates the predictive value of the common carotid \nartery intima-media thickness (CIMT) as a non-invasively accessible marker of \natherosclerosis for stroke risk in addition to variables included in the Framingham \nrisk score (FRS).\nMethods:  In 3669 initially stroke-free subjects from the population-based Heinz \nNixdorf Recall Study (60 \u00b1 8 years, 51% male) various cardiovascular risk factors \nwere measured and stroke events were registered during a mean time interval \nof 85.32 months (SD=17.36). Baseline characteristics were calculated for both \ngenders for subjects subsequently developing or not developing strokes, for three \nage cohorts (45-54 years, 55-64 years, \u226565 years) and three CIMT terciles. Cox \nproportional hazards regressions were used to evaluate determinants of stroke \nrisk including Framingham risk variables [ sex, age, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), \nhigh-density lipoprotein (HDL), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diabetes mellitus \nand smoking] plus CIMT  and in a next step compound risk groups made up from \nFRS and CIMT terciles. \nResults:  In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, CIMT was an independent \nstroke predictor (hazard ratio 1.201, confidence interval 1.004-1.438; p<0.05) \nin addition to age (1.458, 1.212-1.753; p<0.001), systolic blood pressure (1.161, \n1.040-1.296; p<0.01) and smoking (1.957, 1.142-3.351; p<0.05). Separate analysis \nof this significant risk factors in men and women revealed that whereas only \nage (HR 1.453, CI 1.149-1.837; p< 0.01) and CIMT (1.313, 1.073-1.607; p<0.01) \npredicted stroke events in men, stroke risk was associated with age (1.526, 1.139-\n2.045; p<0.01), systolic blood pressure (1.245, 1.058-1.464; p<0.01) and smoking \n(2.732, 1.152-6.452; p< 0.05), but not CIMT (0.940, 0.667-1.325; n.s.) for women. In \nsubjects belonging to the highest FRS (>13%) and CIMT (>0.715 mm) terciles stroke \nrisk was particularly elevated; in the first and second FRS tercile group, increases \nin CIMT did not indicate a significant increase in stroke risk (p=0.80 and p=0.62 for \ntrend, respectively).41Conclusions:  CIMT is an independent stroke predictor in addition to age, systolic \nblood pressure and smoking. Its predictive value is gender-specific as only for men \nhigh CIMT values are associated with an increased stroke risk/incidence. Further, \nCIMT predicts stroke risk particularly in subjects with a Framingham risk score \nabove 13%, implying that conventional risk factors potentiate the CIMT-related \nstroke risk. 42Intracerebroventricularly delivered VEGF promotes contralesional corticorubral \nplasticity after focal cerebral ischemia via mechanisms involving anti-\ninflammatory actions\nJosephine Herz,1 Raluca Reitmeir,1 Sabine I.

Hermann1\n1Department of Neurology, University Hospital, Essen, Germany, 2Department of \nPhysiology, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey, 3Neuroimmunology Unit and \nInstitute of Experimental Neurology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy \nBackground:  Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has potent angiogenic \nand neuroprotective effects in the ischemic brain. Its effect on axonal plasticity \nand neurological recovery in the post-acute stroke phase was unknown. \nMethods:  Using a behavioural test battery that we combined with anterograde \ntract tracing studies as well as with immunohistochemical and molecular biological \nanalysis, we herein examined effects of a delayed i.c.v. delivery of recombinant \nhuman VEGF165, starting 3 days after stroke, on functional neurological recovery, \ncorticorubral plasticity and inflammatory brain responses in mice submitted to 30 \nmin middle cerebral artery occlusion. \nResults:  Slowly progressive improvements of motor grip strength and \ncoordination were noted in VEGF-treated ischemic mice from 14 to 42 days post-\nischemia (dpi) that were accompanied by enhanced sprouting of contralesional \ncorticorubral fibres which branched off the pyramidal tract in order to cross the \nmidline and innervate the ipsilesional parcocellular red nucleus. Infiltrates of \nCD45+ leukocytes were noticed in the ischemic striatum of vehicle-treated mice \nthat closely corresponded to areas exhibiting Iba-1+ activated microglia. VEGF \nattenuated the CD45+ leukocyte infiltrates at 1 4 but not 30 dpi and diminished \nthe Iba-1+ immunoreactivity. The VEGF-induced anti-inflammatory effect was \nassociated with the downregulation of a broad set of inflammatory cytokines and \nchemokines in both brain hemispheres. \nConclusion: Our data suggest a link between VEGF\u2019s immunosuppressive \nand plasticity-promoting actions that may be important for successful brain \nremodeling. Accordingly, growth factors with anti-inflammatory action may be \npromising therapeutic options in the post-acute stroke phase. 43A novel mouse model with a null mutation in Ccdc66 (coiled-coil domain \ncontaining 66) exhibits retinal degeneration and dysfunction\nWanda M.

Canine and murine \nmodels are useful for investigating human RP based on known, naturally occurring \nmutations. In Schapendoes dogs, for example, a mutation in the CCDC66 gene \nhas been shown to cause autosomal recessively inherited, generalised progressive \nretinal atrophy (gPRA), the canine counterpart to RP in man (Dekomien et al., \nNeurogenetics. 2010, 11:163-74).\nMethods:  A novel mouse model with a disrupted Ccdc66 gene was investigated in \norder to reveal the function of protein CCDC66 and the pathogenesis of this form \nof gPRA with molecular biological methods on the DNA, RNA and protein levels; \nimmuno- and electron microscopy as well as physiological assessment of retinal \nfunction by electroretinography (ERG).\nResults : Homozygous Ccdc66 mutant mice with a gene trap 5\u2019 to Ccdc66 exon 4 \nlack retinal Ccdc66 RNA and protein expression. Light and electron microscopy \nreveal an initial degeneration of photoreceptors already at 13 days of age, followed \nby slow, progressive retinal degeneration over months. Retinal dysfunction \ncauses reduced scotopic a-wave amplitudes, declining from 1 to 7 months of \nage as well as an early reduction of the photopic b-wave at 1 month, improving \nslightly at 7 months, as evidenced by electroretinography. In the retina of the \nwildtype (WT) mouse, protein CCDC66 is present at highest levels after \nbirth, followed by a decline until adulthood, suggesting a crucial role in \nearly development. Protein CCDC66 is expressed predominantly in the \ndeveloping rod outer segments as confirmed by subcellular analyses. \nConclusion : These findings illustrate that the lack of protein CCDC66 causes early, \nslow progressive rod-cone dysplasia in the novel Ccdc66 mutant mouse model, \nthus providing a sound foundation for investigating the role of Ccdc66 in retinal \nfunction and the development of therapeutic strategies. 44Funding:  German Research Foundation (DFG EP 7/17-1).\nOriginal Publication:  Gerding WM, Schreiber S, Schulte-Middelmann T, de Castro \nMarques A, Atorf J, Akkad DA, Dekomien G, Kremers J, Dermietzel R, Gal A, R\u00fclicke \nT, Ibrahim S, Epplen JT, Petrasch-Parwez E.

Some \nauthors reported association of nightly headache attacks and different sleep \nstages, particularly with regards to rapid eye movement [REM] sleep in patients \nwith episodic CH. Nevertheless sequential polysomnography [PSG] has not been \nperformed in patients diagnosed with chronic CH to investigate typical attacks \narising from sleep and the relation to particular sleep stages. \nMethods:  To specify which sleep stages are associated with nightly headache \nattacks, we performed PSG in five patients diagnosed with chronic CH during four \nconsecutive nights. Chronic CH was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria \nof the international headache society (ICHD-II).\nAn independent specialist in sleep medicine, blinded to the diagnosis, evaluated a \ntotal of 20 nights and staged sleep stages according to the criteria of Rechtschffen \nand Kales. Participants were instructed to document each headache in terms \nof time of onset, pain intensity, and autonomic symptoms. Furthermore they \nreported each nightly headache attack to the sleep technicians.\nResults:  Eighteen typical CH attacks were reported by the study participants. \nThirteen of these attacks arose from sleep. The beginning of headache attacks \nwere distributed statistically threw out the different non-REM sleep stages. Three \nattacks began from sleep stage I, nine were reported after awakening from sleep \nstage II, and one attack occurred from sleep stage III. Another 5 CH attacks were \nreported after rise in the morning or before going asleep.\n   \nDiscussion:  Appearance of nightly CH attacks is not associated with a particular \nsleep stage. Particularly there was no association with REM sleep. Underlying \npathophysiology remains unclear.\nWe fund a rise in heart rate without another reason (e.g. desaturation or arousal). \nThus this acceleration of heart rate might indicate the beginning of headache \nduring sleep. If this is the case we found a correlation of the beginning of headache \nand transitions from one non-REM sleep stage to another might be possible. \nFurther research seems to be worthwhile. 46Dynamic causal modeling of the network underlying the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion\nThorsten Plewan1, Ralph Weidner1, Simon B. Eickhoff1,2, Gereon R. Fink1,3\n1Institut of Neuroscience and Medicine, Research Centre J\u00fclich, J\u00fclich, Germany\n2Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lische Technische \nHochschule Aachen University, Aachen, Germany\n3Department of Neurology, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany\nThe M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion is an optical illusion that alters the perceived length of a \nline via arrows attached to its end. Recent imaging studies revealed that ventral \nand dorsal stream areas contribute to the processing of the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion \n(Weidner et al., 2010; Weidner & Fink, 2007). \nHere we investigated [using dynamic causal modeling (DCM; Friston, Harrison, & \nPenny, 2003)] the effects of this illusion on the effective connectivity of the brain \nareas involved in coding illusion strength. Strength of the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion was \nparametrically modulated while participants performed either a landmark task or \na non-spatial control task. \nRelative to the control task, the landmark task increased neural activity in lateral \noccipital cortex and right superior parietal cortex dependent upon illusion \nstrength. Based on these findings DCM was used to investigate the possible \ninteractions between ventral and dorsal visual stream. Bayesian model selection \n(Stephan et al., 2009) indicated that a model involving bi-directional connections \nbetween dorsal and ventral stream areas most accurately accounted for the \nunderlying network dynamics. In this model, illusion strength enhanced bi-\ndirectional couplings of bilateral lateral occipital cortex and the right superior \nparietal cortex.\nThe data suggest that the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion arises due to recurrent processing \nbetween dorsal and ventral stream areas. Additionally, connectivity was selectively \nmodulated by top-down control, implying that the processes generating the \nM\u00fcller-Lyer illusion are, at least in part, under endogenous control.47Structural and behavioural differences between high and low trait-anxious \nindividuals\nAnnuschka Eden\u00b9, Jan Schreiber\u00b2, Peter Zwanzger\u00b3, Kati Keuper\u00b9, Christian Dobel\u00b9\n\u00b9Institute for Biomagnetism and Biosignalanalysis, University Hospital M\u00fcnster; \n\u00b2Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig; \u00b3Department \nof Psychiatry, University Hospital M\u00fcnster\nBackground:  Learning, conditioning and a genetic predisposition influence \nthe processing of negative emotional stimuli and present the basis for the \ndevelopment of anxiety disorders. This study focuses on the learning-process, \nmemory-consolidation and the associated neural fibre-connections in subjects \nwith low and elevated trait-anxiety. Latter individuals are particularly prone to \ndevelop anxiety-disorders and differ from people with reduced or average trait-\nanxiety with regard to the processing, evaluation and memory of threat-related \nstimulus-material (McCabe, 1999; Russo et al., 2006; Mitte, 2008; Waldhauser et \nal., 2011). To date, studies on memory-biases in subclinical anxiety patients do not \nadd up to a consistent picture. While some authors strongly support the existence \nof a memory bias, others blame findings on unpropitious experimental designs \n(Dowens & Calvo, 2003) or insufficient criterions (Russo et al 2009). It is the intent \nof this study to clarify if and how subclinical high and low trait anxious individuals \ndiffer from each other. \nMethods:  The State Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al., 1983) was used to \nform two groups: one high and one low in trait-anxiety (each n=27). An associative \nword-learning training was implemented to investigate the development of a \nbias for negatively arousing stimuli. Thereby, 60 neutral word stimuli (e.g. foha) \nwere linked with negative arousing colour pictures (e.g. an attacking shark). To \ncheck for memory-biases, we implicitly and explicitly tested the learned word-\nmaterial. These tests were carried out directly after training and two weeks \nlater. The latter served to investigate the impact of consolidation. A subgroup \nof n=34 female subjects were additionally scanned via Diffusion Tensor Imaging \n(DTI). Tract-based spatial statistics from FSL-toolbox were applied to investigate \ndifferences regarding white matter integrity between groups via calculation of \nfractional anisotropy (FA).\nResults:  Results of the recall test show significant group-differences, indicating an \nexplicit memory-bias. Higher recall-rates were exclusively found in high anxiety \nindividuals; thus, replicating the previously found (but highly debated) interaction \neffect between factors anxiety and arousal-type. Results of the valence-rating \nshow a main effect for factor group. However, responses during the training \ndisplay increasing learning curves for all subjects but do not indicate differences \nbetween groups. Thus, no evidence for the development of a bias during the \nacquisition of the new word-material was found. Analysis of the DTI-data revealed \nsignificant differences in dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC) regions with the \nlow-anxiety group exhibiting higher FA-Values, hence stronger integrity of white \nmatter.48Conclusions: Overall, the results clearly emphasize neuroanatomical and \nbehavioural differences between subclinical high and low trait-anxious \nindividuals. Behavioural differences regarding learning are stronger for explicit \nthan implicit memory. The absence of group-differences during the training \nsuggests that development of the memory-bias takes place at later learning-\nstages such as consolidation or retrieval. Consolidated implicit responses of the \nhigh anxiety group indicate a generalization-bias, which might be due to different \nconsolidation-mechanisms and which is associated with lower white matter \nintegrity in right-hemispheric dlPFC regions. This interpretation is discussed in \nrelation to current theories on anxiety disorders and major depression.\nFunding: Interdisziplin\u00e4res Zentrum f\u00fcr klinische Forschung (IZKF) M\u00fcnster \n(Do3/021/10)49Funktionelle Magnetresonanztomographie des Cerebellums bei der \nPrismenadaptation\nMeret W\u00fcnnemann1, Roxana Stefanescu1,2, Markus Th\u00fcrling1,2, Stefan Maderwald2, \nHans-Gerd Elles1, Mark E.

Welche Regionen im Kleinhirn-Kortex f\u00fcr \ndiese Adaptation wesentlich sind, konnte in tier- und humanexperimentellen \nStudien noch nicht abschlie\u00dfend gekl\u00e4rt werden. Eine funktionelle Einbindung \nder Kleinhirn-Kerne in die Prismenadaptation wurde bislang nicht untersucht. \nBesonders interessant ist die Darstellung des Aktvierungsmusters des \nNucleus dentatus, da Hinweise auf eine funktionelle Aufteilung in eine dorso-\nrostrale motorische und ventro-caudale nicht-motorische Dom\u00e4ne vorliegen. \nArbeitshypothese ist, dass die nicht-motorische Dom\u00e4ne im Besonderen w\u00e4hrend \ndes Adaptationsvorgangs aktiviert ist, nicht aber w\u00e4hrend einer motorischen \nKontrollbedingung.\nMethode:  Gesunde, rechtsh\u00e4ndige Probanden (20 Probanden, 14 m\u00e4nnlich, \n6 weiblich, Durchschnittsalter 26,65 Jahre (21-33)) wurden in die Studie \neingeschlossen. In einem Blockdesign erfolgte zuerst eine motorische \nKontrollaufgabe bestehend aus Zeigebewegungen der rechten Hand auf ein \nvisuelles Ziel. Nachfolgend erfolgte die Adaptation der Zeigebewegungen an \nein optisches Prisma mit 20\u00b0 Lateralverschiebung nach rechts. W\u00e4hrend der \nBewegungsausf\u00fchrung wurden fMRT Aufnamen des Kleinhirns im Ultrahochfeld \n(Magnetom 7T, Siemens Healthcare) gemacht. Die statistische Analyse der \nfMRT Daten erfolgte mit Hilfe der Software Statistical Parametric Mapping \n(SPM8). Zur exakten anatomischen Zuordnung aktivierter Kleinhirnareale \nwurden probabilistische Atlanten des Kleinhirnkortex und der Kleinhirnkerne \nherangezogen. \nErgebnisse:  Bei den bisher ausgewerteten Probanden zeigen sich im Kleinhirn-\nKortex w\u00e4hrend der Zeigebewegungen Aktivierungen vermal und rechts \nparavermal im oberen (Lobulus V, VI) und unteren (Lobulus VIII) Handareal. \nW\u00e4hrend der Adaptation lassen sich keine signifikanten Unterschiede der \nAktivierung im Vergleich zur Kontrollbedingung mittels Subtraktionsanalyse \nfeststellen. Im Nucleus dentatus zeigte sich eine Aktivierung im motorischen \nAnteil beidseits w\u00e4hrend der Zeigebewegungen. Zus\u00e4tzlich lassen sich w\u00e4hrend \nder Adaptation Aktivierungen im nicht-motorischen Anteil des ipsilateralen \nNucleus dentatus zeigen.\nDiskussion:  F\u00fcr den Kleinhirnkortex konnten keine Unterschiede im \nAktivierungsmuster zwischen Prismenadaptation und motorischer \nKontrollbedingung beobachtet werden. Mit unseren Untersuchungen konnten \nwir eine adaptations-spezifische Aktivierung im nicht-motorischen Anteil des 50Nucleus dentatus nachweisen. Dieses fMRT-Ergebnis ist gut vereinbar mit \ntierexperimentell beschriebenen Verbindungen zwischen dem ventro-kaudalen \nAnteil des Nucleus dentatus und dem posterioren parietalen Kortex, der eine \nzentrale Rolle bei der visuo-motorischen Adaptation einnimmt.\nF\u00f6rderung : Deutsche-Heredo-Ataxie Gesellschaft e.V.

In particular, the \naMCC featured not only increased activity for internal movement selection but \neven higher levels of activation when the timing of movement execution was \nfree, i.e., not cued. It has furthermore been suggested that multiple prefrontal, \nparietal, and premotor areas interact with the aMCC in context of self-initiated \nmovements of various types. The aMCC may thus represent an interface between \ncognitive and motor networks. Here we tested this assumption comparing \nfunctional connectivity patterns of the MCC at \u201crest\u201d, i.e., during the absence of \nan external task, and in the context of explicit task conditions.\nMethods:  Functional connectivity of the aMCC was assessed by means of two \ncomplementary approaches. Using the BrainMap database we first identified all \ndatabased experiments that featured activation in the aMCC. We then performed \nan ALE meta-analysis over these experiments in order to reveal significant co-\nactivation patterns by meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM).  Furthermore, \nwe conducted a seed-based connectivity analysis on \u201cresting-state\u201d fMRI \nobtained from 79 healthy subjects. Following spatial preprocessing, removing the \neffects of potential confounds and band-pass filtering, each voxels time-course \nwas correlated with the time course of the aMCC seed. A group analysis was \nthen performed by means of a one-sample t-test on the Fisher\u2019s Z transformed \nindividual correlation-coefficients. All results were (cluster-level) corrected for \nmultiple comparisons (p < 0.05) and compared by a conjunction analysis over task-\nrelated (i.e. MACM) and task-free (i.e. resting state) connectivity patterns. Finally, \na conjunction analysis was performed over the resulting functional connectivity \nmap and our former fMRI study comparing free timed action selection with \nreactive movements in 35 healthy subjects.\nResults:  MACM and resting-state analysis yielded virtually identical connectivity \nmaps, indicating a consistent functional connectivity of the aMCC during \nexplicit (externally driven) tasks and a task-free state. Moreover, the subsequent \nconnectivity network also overlapped considerably with the contrast \u201cinternally \nvs. externally driven movements\u201d in the fMRI study. The conjunction over \nall three analyses (co-activation, resting-state correlation and activation by \ninternally driven movements) indicated consistent functional connectivity of the \naMCC with both sensorimotor and \u201ccognitive\u201d brain regions. Bilateral activity \nin sensorimotor-related regions was found in the dorsal and medial premotor \ncortices, the putamen, cerebellum, and thalamus. \u201cCognitive\u201d regions interacting \nwith the aMCC were dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, Ares 44/45, anterior insula \nand rostral inferior parietal cortex.53Discussion : We assessed the functional connectivity of the aMCC by independently \nanalyzing the dynamics of the \u201cresting\u201d and the active brain. That is, a specific \nco-activation pattern of the aMCC was equally present in states where subjects \nhad to engage in structured, externally purported tasks as well as in a task-free \n\u201cresting\u201d state. Our results demonstrated a close correspondence between both \nstates, which points to a rather fundamental underlying feature of the aMCC \nrelating to functional connectivity. The MCC is associated with complex cognitive \nfunctions like reward guided action selection or anticipated response conflict and \nerror likelihood. We here provide evidence for a more fundamental functional \nrole of the MCC for initiating and implementing intentional motor control by \nconnecting higher order and motor systems in the brain.54A high-resolution 7T protocol for clinical depiction of brain vasculature\nJohst S1,2, Wrede KH1,3, Dammann P1,3, Schlamann MU3, Sandalcioglu IE3, Sure U3, \nLadd SC1,2, Ladd ME1,2, Maderwald S1\n1Erwin L. Hahn Institute for MRI, University Duisburg-Essen, Germany 2/3Diagnostic \nand Interventional Radiology and Neuroradiology / Neurosurgery, University \nHospital Essen, Germany \nIntroduction: High-quality pre-operative / pre-interventional images are essential \nfor the treatment of intra-cerebral vascular pathologies. Digital subtraction \nangiography (DSA) is still the gold standard, but with new ultra-high field MRI \nscanners, MR angiography (MRA) has the opportunity to become even more \ncompetitive. Especially the visibility of the vasculature in time-of-flight (TOF) MRA \nhighly profits from increased field strengths [1]. The goal of this study was to set up \na 7T whole-brain vasculature examination protocol within a clinically acceptable \noverall acquisition time. Main optimization targets were high-resolution TOF MRA \nand susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) for the evaluation of the arterial and \nvenous systems, respectively. For the TOF, the variable rate selective excitation \n(VERSE) algorithm [2-4] and modified venous saturation pulses were used to \nameliorate SAR restrictions.\nMaterial and Methods: A 7T whole-body system (Magnetom 7T, Siemens) \nequipped with a 32-channel Rx/Tx head coil (Nova Medical) was used. The \nfollowing modifications in sequence source code were implemented: GRAPPA \nacceleration factors up to R=8 in phase-encoding direction (2D) and doubling \nof the number of acquirable slices. The VERSE algorithm was applied to the \nexcitation / saturation pulses of the TOF sequence [2, 3]. The saturation pulses \nwere optimized in duration and flip angle to minimize TR. In the MP-RAGE the \nadiabatic inversion recovery (IR) RF pulse was replaced by an adiabatic Wideband \nUniform Rate Smooth Truncation (WURST) [5] pulse with higher bandwidth and \nless sensitivity to 7T-intrinsic B1 inhomogeneities. The protocol was optimized \nin 5 healthy volunteers and performed in 20 patients with cerebral aneurysm, \narteriovenous malformation (AVM), or Moyamoya syndrome (N=11/6/3). The \noverall quality of all sequences was rated by visual assessment by an experienced \nneuroradiologist on a three-point scale: 1=poor/non-diagnostic, 2=acceptable/\ndiagnostic, 3=excellent quality.\nResults: MP-RAGE:  TA=4min 58s, GRAPPA R=2, 0.7x0.7x0.7mm3. 3D FLASH TOF : \nTA=6min 40s per slab, GRAPPA R=4, 0.22x0.22x0.41mm3, VERSE cut-off threshold \n50% / 20% for excitation/saturation (2,5ms, \u03b1SAT=35\u00b0, every TR) pulse. 3 slabs to \ncover the entire brain were merged via weighted overlapping into a 3D dataset. 3D \nSWI:  TA=14min 34s, GRAPPA R=4, 0.5x0.5x0.5mm3. 2D TSE:  TA=4min 24s, GRAPPA \nR=2, 0.5x0.5x3.0mm3.All volunteers and patients tolerated the examination \nwell and could be successfully examined within 1 hour. All images were rated \nacceptable to excellent. The MP-RAGE provided clinical T1 contrast in ultra-high \nisotropic resolution and is additionally perfect as a localizer for all other sequences \ndue to bright vessel depiction [1]. The WURST IR pulse afforded uniform inversion a)55without visible contrast changes e.g. in the cerebellum. The TOF sequence enabled \nMIP images of the complete vascular tree with a voxel volume of smaller than \n0.02 mm\u00b3. The VERSE algorithm enabled the application of optimized saturation \npulses within a TR of 20ms; no venous overlay was visible. The SWI provided \nexcellent T2* contrast, which is valuable for the delineation between arteries \nand veins. Finally, the double-contrast turbo spin echo completed the clinical 7T \nprotocol with PD/T2 contrast: 43 slices permit (nearly) whole-brain coverage with \nadequate resolution for clinical diagnosis.\nDiscussion: This study shows a complete clinical 7T brain protocol. Especially the \nhigh-resolution TOF MRA seems to provide excellent results for depicting the \ncerebral arterial structures. The complete arterial vasculature of the brain is visible \nin a single 3D dataset. In the future, (dynamic) contrast-enhanced scans (with \nhigh temporal resolution) or arterial spin labeling may add additional information \nregarding blood flow, especially interesting when depicting cerebral AVMs.\nReferences:  [1] Maderwald MAGMA 21:159-167(2008); [2] Johst ISMRM 2010,2252; \n[3] Schmitter ISMRM 2010,4424; [4] Conolly JMagReson 78:440-458(1988); [5] \nKupce JMagReson 115(2):273-6 (1995)56Der Einfluss akuter Schlaganfall induzierter Basalganglienl\u00e4sionen auf \nbelohnungsabh\u00e4ngiges Lernen \nSeidel U.K.1, Gronewold, J.1, Wicking M.2, Bellebaum C.3, Hermann D.M.1\n1 Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Essen \u2013 Neurologische Klinik, Vaskul\u00e4re Neurologie, Essen,  2 \nZentralinstitut f\u00fcr Seelische Gesundheit, Institut f\u00fcr Neuropsychologie und Klinische \nPsychologie, Ruprecht-Karls-Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, \n3 Ruhr Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Institut f\u00fcr kognitive Neurowissenschaft \u2013 \nNeuropsychologie, Bochum\nEinleitung: Die Basalganglien (BG) spielen eine entscheidende Rolle beim \nLernen durch Feedback.

The amygdala \n(Am) and the insular cortex (IC) are important brain regions for the acquisition \nof peripheral immune borne signals. In order to analyze how peripheral immune \nresponses differently affect brain activity, we recorded neural activity in these \nspecific brain regions of adult male rats during a stereotypic immune response. \nMethods:  In a between subjects design, animals were challenged with the \npotent T cell dependent superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). After a \nsingle (na\u00efve) as well as after repeated (desensitization) antigen administrations, \nthe neural activity of the same individuals was analyzed via stereotactically \nimplanted deep brain monopolar electrodes and a telemetry recording system. \nBody temperature and cytokine concentration measurements were performed to \nconfirm the biological activity of the antigens and the success of the immune-\ndesensitization protocol. \nResults:  Already within the fi rst 200 min after antigen inoculation, the dynamics \nand magnitude of the electrical activity recorded from the IC and Am were \ndifferent depending on the antigen administration protocol: single (na\u00efve) versus \nrepeated (desensitization) SEB treatment. Moreover, in the same individuals, we \ndocumented that the immune history significantly affects the neural response \nto the same antigen challenge; i.e. after desensitization both antigens induced a \ndifferent neural response, indicating a different perception of the same antigenic \nchallenge.\nDiscussion: The results indicate that neural activity of the Am and IC is not only \nspecific for the type of immune challenge (Saline vs. SEB) but also sensitive to the \ndifferent immune state (SEB na\u00efve vs. SEB desensitization). These findings indicate \nthat the brain is able to express specific electrical activity patterns related to \nthe modality of a peripheral immune activation, as well as to the intensity of \nthe stimulation, supporting the conceptualization of the immune system as a \n\u201csensory organ\u201d.\nFunding : German Research Foundation (DFG SCHE 341/13-1)58The influence of a confrontation with alcohol related cues on the inhibitory \ncontrol in alcohol dependent patients\nMainz, V.; Drueke, B.; Forkmann, T.; Kessel, R.; Gauggel, S.\nInstitute of Medical Psychology and Medical Sociology, University Hospital of the \nRWTH Aachen, Germany \nIntroduction: Studies investigating social and alcohol-dependent drinkers show \nimpaired performances in tasks requiring inhibitory control if participants are \nconfronted with alcohol-related cues (Muraven et al., 2006; Gauggel et al., 2010). \nThe study at hand investigates the influence of a cue exposure on the inhibitory \ncontrol in alcohol-dependent patients and the associated neuronal correlates. It is \nassumed that a cue exposure has a negative impact on the performance in a task \nrequiring inhibitory control and that the corresponding neuronal correlates of the \nrelevant conditions are associated with motivational control of behaviour. \nMethods: In this study 11 alcohol-dependent male patients (age M=44; SD=11) \nperformed a task requiring the ability to inhibit certain responses (Stop-Signal-\nTask, Logan, 1994) while lying in a Magnet Resonance Tomograph. The task \nwas executed either after exposure to the smell of the patients` most favourite \nalcohol (A) or after smelling an orange flavour. Before and after cue exposure the \nurge to drink was assessed with a questionnaire (Alcohol-Craving-Questionnaire, \nSingleton et al., 1995).\nResults: The patients report a significantly stronger urge for alcohol after the \napplication of A compared to after smelling the orange flavour. However, this \nwas not reflected in reaction time differences in the task. When comparing the \nneuronal correlates of the alcohol cue exposure with the confrontation with the \norange smell, differential activation became evident in the hippocampus and the \namygdala. During the inhibition task both conditions showed typical activation \nintermingled in inhibitory processes (i.e., inferior frontal gyrus).\nDiscussion: The confrontation with alcohol related cues triggered a stronger \nurge for the substance compared to the control condition. The urge for alcohol \nlasted over the whole experiment and seems to be associated with differential \nactivation of the amygdala and hippocampus. In agreement with the behavioural \ndata neuronal activation was found expectedly in regions relevant for the \nperformance of the Stop-Signal-Task. However, these results cannot support the \nview that induced alcohol craving necessarily leads to poorer inhibitory control.  59Visualization of macroscopic cerebral vessel anatomy \u2013 a new and reliable \ntechnique in mice  \nMohammad R. Hasan, Josephine Herz, Dirk M. Hermann and Thorsten R. Doeppner\nDepartment of Neurology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany\nIntroduction:  The visualization of the cerebral vasculature in the rodent brain \nhas become an important tool in experimental stroke research and related \ncerebrovascular studies. In this context, transcardial or intraarterial perfusion \nwith colored latex has been the method of choice until recently. However, this \ntechnique still has some technical limitations compromising the reproducibility \nof vessel staining. Thus, we describe a simple and reproducible method for \npermanent visualization of macroscopic cerebral vessels in mice. \nMethods:  A mixture of two commercially available carbon black inks with \ndifferent viscosities was injected into the thoracic aorta in mice. \nResults:  The method yielded efficient filling of cerebral vessels with dye, providing \na high contrast visualization of vessel architecture. The feasibility of this technique \nhas been validated by identifying the anastomotic points between the anterior \nand the middle cerebral arterial territories after focal cerebral ischemia. We also \ninvestigated the relationship of the distribution of these vascular zones with the \ninfarction volume for different ischemic durations at various reperfusion time \npoints. \nConclusion: This new vessel staining technique will open up further opportunities \nin a variety of cerebrovascular research applications.60New function of synapses: Synaptic innervation of interneuron precursors directs \ntheir migration\nAnnika K. Wefers1,2, Christian Haberlandt2, J.J.L. van der Want3, Christian \nSteinh\u00e4user2, Karl Schilling1, Ronald Jabs2\n1Institute of Anatomy, Anatomy and Cell Biology, and 2Institute of Cellular \nNeurosciences, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany, 3Department of Cell Biology, \nMolecular Imaging and Electron Microscopy, University of Groningen, The \nNetherlands\nBackground:  Interneurons typically originate from neuroepithelia far from \ntheir final positions and thus have to migrate extensively before they may be \nsynaptically integrated to form a functional adult network. The mechanisms \ndirecting interneuronal migration are only poorly understood. Here we addressed \nthe question how migration and eventual synaptic innervation might relate. At \nwhich time during their development get interneuron precursors innervated? As \na model, we studied electrophysiological characteristics and migratory behaviour \nof early postnatal precursors of inhibitory cerebellar basket/stellate neurons. \nThey migrate from the ventricular epithelium through the white matter into the \ncerebellar cortex. \nMethods:  We used 200 - 300 \u00b5m thick acute sagittal slices from the cerebellar \nvermis of 7 - 9 day old transgenic Pax2-GFP mice, in which basket/stellate cells and \ntheir precursors (collectively referred to as \u201cPax2-cells\u201d below) may be identified \ndue to expression of green fluorescent protein. We recorded currents mediated \nby AMPA- and GABAA-receptor agonists and looked for spontaneously occurring \npost-synaptic currents in Pax2-cells. In some cases, electrophysiological data \nwere measured after verifying that the cells actively migrate by monitoring the \ntranslocation of the cells eventually patched.Further, we employed two-photon \ntime-lapse recordings (xyzt) to define the migratory behaviour of Pax2-cells. \nFor all Pax2-cells, we calculated isosurfaces, centres of mass and corresponding \nquantitative parameters of cell migration using Imaris software (Bitplane, Z\u00fcrich, \nSwitzerland). To assess the effect of synaptic innervation, we compared migration \nparameters before (\u201ccontrol\u201d) and after blocking release of presynaptic vesicles \nwith 100 \u00b5g/ml tetanus toxin. \nResults: All Pax2-cells, irrespective of their position in the cerebellar anlage \n(and hence developmental stage), expressed AMPA- and GABAA-receptors, \ntwo subtypes of ionotropic transmitter receptors. Unexpectedly, once they \nentered the cerebellar cortex, but long before finally settling, most Pax2-cells \nreceived synaptic input, both glutamatergic and GABAergic. Block of presynaptic \ntransmitter release altered the speed of migrating Pax2-cells only moderately. \nHowever, in contrast to the control situation, following presynaptic blockade \nmost cells lost directionality and remained very close to their initial position. This \nindicates that not the speed but the straightness of migration is significantly \nimpaired after disruption of synaptic innervation. 61Discussion: It is generally assumed that migrating neuronal precursors first \nsettle down at their final destination before they synaptically integrate. Indeed, \nsynaptic integration is often considered the hallmark of terminal neuronal \ndifferentiation. In contrast, we find that cerebellar inhibitory interneuronal \nprecursors receive synaptic input while still migrating. This constitutes a hitherto \nunknown mode of cellular interaction in the CNS. Our data strongly suggest that \nthese developmental synaptic contacts are critical to direct the migration and \nproper positioning of immature cerebellar interneurons.\nFunding: Supported by the DFG (GK 246; SFB/TR3, SPP1172)62Time to make a change: Relation between reversal learning performance and \nfeedback-related negativity\nKobza S1, Storzer L1, Bellebaum C1.\n1Dept. of Neuropsychology, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Ruhr University \nBochum\nIntroduction:  A core part of the reinforcement learning (RL) theory of the \nfeedback-related negativity (FRN), an event-related potentials component \nreflecting activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), suggests that in RL \ntasks, less expected negative feedback leads to an increase of ACC activity and \nthus larger FRN amplitude. While this prediction could be confirmed in previous \nstudies, another prediction of the RL-FRN theory \u2013 linking the FRN to subsequent \nbehavioural optimisation \u2013 has not been supported by empirical evidence to date. \nThis study aimed to elucidate whether the FRN immediately following contingency \nreversals  is linked to adaptation of behaviour.\nMethods:  15 subjects completed a feedback-based reversal learning task in which \nthey had to choose one of two symbols presented on a computer screen on each \nof 750 trials. Following their choice, positive (\u201ccorrect\u201d, + 10 points) or negative \n(\u201cincorrect\u201d, - 10 points) feedback was displayed. Unknown to the subjects, the \nprobabilities of positive feedback for the symbols, 80 % and 20 % respectively, \nwere reversed whenever performance accuracy reached a level of 70 % correct \nresponses. The feedback allowed behavioural adjustment in order to optimise \nperformance. Throughout the task, electroencephalography was recorded. Based \non performance, subjects were assigned to the groups of slow and fast reversal \nlearners respectively.\nResults:  Both overall and when considering only unexpected negative feedback \ndirectly after reversals, the FRN was more pronounced in fast compared to slow \nreversal learners. This effect was not related to between-group differences in \nfeedback frequency. For both groups, the FRN was larger for more unexpected \nnegative feedback.\nConclusion: Increased FRN amplitude in fast reversal learners supports the view \nthat higher ACC activity leads to faster behavioural adaptation. This assumption \nis in line with the recent finding of larger FRN amplitudes following negative \nfeedback which precedes altered choice behaviour in a gambling task. In rule-based \nreversal learning tasks, however, early detection of reversals is most important \nfor optimised behavioural adaptation. Therefore, immediately following reversals , \nhigher ACC activity as reflected in a larger FRN facilitates adequate change of \nchoice behaviour and \u2013 in consequence \u2013 higher performance.63KCNQ channels in the thalamus: role of a neuronal brake in sensory perception\nManuela Cerina, Hanna Szkudlarek, Hans Christian Pape, Thomas Budde, \nPhilippe Coulon\nInstitute for Physiology I, Westf\u00e4lische-Wilhelms University, M\u00fcnster, Germany\nBackground:  KCNQ channels are low-threshold potassium channels which are \nknown to be composed of subunits of the Kv7 K+channel family (Kv7.1-Kv7.5). Four \nof these (Kv7.2-Kv7.5) are expressed in the nervous system, and Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 \nare the principal molecular components of the slow voltage-gated M-channels. \nSince they do not inactivate, they generate a steady voltage-dependent outward \ncurrent called the M-current. It stabilizes the membrane potential in the presence \nof depolarizing inputs and may have a key role in regulating the excitability of \nvarious central and peripheral neurons. The present study aims at elucidating \nthe role of M-channels in thalamocortical signalling, in the regulation of the \nsleep/wake cycle, and in absence seizures in the thalamic ventrobasal nuclei. In \naddition, those nuclei  are  also involved in a variety of physiological functions, \nsuch as sensory discrimination or transmission and modulation of pain signals. \nMoreover, it will be investigated whether they are capable of modulating signals \nalong the pain pathway. \nMethods:  M-channels are closed by receptors coupled to Gq,  such as M1 and \nM3 muscarinic receptors, and several endogenous and exogenous compounds \ncan modulate their gating properties. Here, a modulation of these channels \nis obtained pharmacologically by using the M-channel blocker XE991 which \ndecreases M-current amplitude, and the enhancer Retigabine, a broad-spectrum \nanticonvulsant and an effective analgesic, which increases this current. Moreover, \nin order to understand the role of thalamic M-channels in pain sensation, the Hot \nplate test has been performed after Retigabine intrathalamic injection in freely \nbehaving animals.  \nResults:  In vitro  Retigabine application, as expected, induces an increase in \nM-current amplitude and, interestingly, this effect seems to be age-dependent, \nwith the current amplitude reaching its peak at P20. Also muscarinic receptor \nagonists and antagonists effectively modulate these channels in the thalamus. \nAdditionally, in vivo  Retigabine administration seems to be able to increase \nlatency in hot plate test.\nDiscussion: M-channels in thalamus seem to modulate the cell excitability by \nregulating spike frequency adaptation. Since M-channels have been found to \nplay an important role in modulating animal response to thermic pain stimuli, it \nis reasonable to think that they could play a role in discriminating other kinds of  \npain input in thalamic ventrobasal nuclei.64Genetic risk factors associated with increased body mass index in a genome-\nwide association study for childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\n\u00d6 Albayrak1, A Scherag2, C P\u00fctter2, S Cichon3,4, Per Hoffmann4 Markus M. \nN\u00f6then4, K-H J\u00f6ckel2,5, S Schreiber6, HE Wichmann7, B Herpertz-Dahlmann8, G \nLehmkuhl9, J Sinzig9,10, TJ Renner11, M Romanos11,12, A Warnke11, KP Lesch12, A \nReif13, BG Schimmelmann14, J Hebebrand1, A Hinney1\n1Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Duisburg-Essen, \nEssen, Germany, 2Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, \nUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany, 3Institute of Neuroscience \nand Medicine (INM-1), Structural and Functional Organization of the Brain, \nGenomic Imaging, Research Center Juelich, Juelich, Germany, 4a) Institute of \nHuman Genetics, University of Bonn und b) Dept. of Genomics, Life & Brain \nCenter, University of Bonn), 5for the Heinz Nixdorf Recall study group, 6for the \nPopgen study group; Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, University Hospital \nSchleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany, 7 for the KORA study group; \nInstitute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Center Munich, German Research Center for \nEnvironmental Health, Munich, Germany, 8Department of Child and Adolescent \nPsychiatry, Technical University of Aachen, Aachen, Germany, 9Department \nof Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany, \n10Department for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, LVR - Klinik \nBonn, Bonn, Germany, 11Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Julius-\nMaximilians-University Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany, 12Department of Child \nand Adolescent Psychiatry, University Munich, Munich, Germany, 13Department of \nPsychiatry and Psychotherapy, Julius-Maximilians-University W\u00fcrzburg, W\u00fcrzburg, \nGermany, 14University Hospital of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of \nBern, Bern, Switzerland\nObjective:  Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have \na higher rate of obesity than children without ADHD. Hence, gene variants \npredisposing to obesity might be relevant for ADHD.  We examined whether \nknown risk alleles for an increased body mass index (BMI) are associated with \nADHD. 32 risk alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were screened in a \nGWAS sample of patients with ADHD and controls.  \nMethods:  A genome wide association study (GWAS) was performed in 495 children \nwith ADHD (Illumina; HumanHap550v3 BeadArrays) and 1,300 population based \ncontrols (Illumina; Human660W-Quadv1 BeadArrays).  \nResults:  We detected significant association of the C-allele at SNP rs3798560 \n(p=0.000278, corrected for 32 SNP: 0.0089; OR 1.376) with childhood ADHD. SNP \nrs3798560 is located within the intronic region of nudix (nucleoside diphosphate \nlinked moiety X-type motif 3 gene; NUDT3). Additionally, SNP alleles near the \ngenes for mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5 (MAP2K5), melanocortin 4 \nreceptor (MC4R), mitochondrial carrier 2 (MTCH2) and solute carrier family 39 \n(zinc transporter) member 8 (SLC39A8) were nominally associated with ADHD at \na trend level (p < 0.1). Risk alleles for BMI and ADHD were directionally consistent 65in 18 of 32 loci.\nConclusions:  We identified association of an obesity risk allele to ADHD. Thus, we \ndescribe a chromosomal region that harbors a candidate gene that is potentially \nrelevant for both ADHD and obesity. \nFunding:  The German Ministry for Education and Research (National Genome \nResearch Net plus 01GS0820), the German Research Foundation (DFG; HE 1446/9-\n1, KFO 125/1-1, SCHA 542/10-2, ME 1923/5-1, ME 1923/5-3), the European \nCommunity\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant \nagreement n\u00b0 245009. 66Involvement of the human medial temporal lobe in a visual discrimination task\nRobert Lech1, 2, Boris Suchan1, 2\n1Inst. of Cognitive Neuroscience, Dept. of Neuropsychology, Ruhr University Bochum\n2International Graduate School of Neuroscience,  Ruhr University Bochum\nIntroduction:  The structures of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) are traditionally \nbelieved to be specialized for declarative and relational learning and memory \nand hence are labeled the \u201cmedial temporal lobe memory system\u201d. However, \nrecent  imaging and lesion studies suggest that the human MTL, including the \nhippocampus and the parahippocampal gyrus, could be involved in processing and \ndiscrimination of complex visual stimuli. Patient studies show a possible double \ndissociation of the putative perceptive functions: While patients with selective \nhippocampal damage are impaired in the visual discrimination of morphed scenes \nbut not morphed faces, patients with selective MTL damage show the opposite \npattern. Another functional difference has been shown for recognition memory: \nWhile the hippocampus seems to be strongly linked to recollection memory, \nthe perirhinal cortex might be involved in the processing of familiarity memory. \nThe aim of this study is to further elucidate the contributions of different MTL \nstructures to perceptual and mnemonic processing using functional magnetic \nresonance imaging (fMRI).\nMethods:  20 healthy right-handed subjects participated in the fMRI study, each \nattending two experimental sessions in a 3T magnetic resonance scanner. In the \nfirst task (T1), participants had to discriminate visual stimuli (faces and scenes) \nin an oddball task. Three trial unique stimuli were presented simultaneously to \nminimize memory demands. In the second task, participants had to memorize \na set of unfamiliar faces and scenes. One week later (T2) these stimuli were \npresented together with distractors and additional stimuli from the oddball task. \nSubjects had to indicate whether they recognized the presented pictures and how \nsure they were about this judgement.\nResults:  Imaging data reveals strong bilateral activity in primary visual areas \nextending through the ventral stream to the parahippocampal gyrus for the \nvisual discrimination task (without explicit memory demands). Behavioural data \nalso shows that only a small fraction of the stimuli from this task was encoded \nincidentally, as opposed to the stimuli that had to be memorized explicitly in the \nsecond task.\nConclusions: By minimizing the memory demand and controlling for incidental \nencoding we could show a significant activation of MTL structures for a visual \ndiscrimination task, which points to an involvement beyond memory processing. \nTherefore, these results show further support for a perceptual-mnemonic theory \nof the MTL.\nFunding:  German Research Foundation (SFB 874)67Modulation of TASK channels in the rat thalamocortical relay neurons\nPawan Bista, Mathias Pawlowski, Tatiana Kanyshkova, Petra Ehling, Swen Meuth, \nHans Christian Pape and Thomas Budde\n1Institute of Physiology I (Neurophysiology), Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-University \nM\u00fcnster, Robert-Koch-Strasse 27a, 48149 M\u00fcnster, Germany \n2Department of Neuropathophysiologie, Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t \nM\u00fcnster , Domagkstr. 13, 48149 M\u00fcnster, Germany \nBackground:  The thalamocortical relay (TC) neuron can operate with two different \nfiring modes according to the arousal state of the brain. The relay mode under \nthe condition of vigilance, during which the thalamus relays afferent sensory \ninformation to the cortex and the burst mode, which is associated with rhythmic \nbursts of high frequency action potentials during sleep, drowsiness and epileptic \nseizures. The switch between these activity modes is mediated by neurons of the \nascending brainstem system including brainstem cholinergic neurons that release \nacetylcholine (ACh). These neurotransmitters act by depolarizing the membrane \npotential of TC neurons, leading to cessation of rhythmic bursts and occurrence \nof  tonic activity. One crucial step of membrane depolarization is the decrease in a \nleak K+ conductance, which is mainly carried by members of the two pore domain \nK+ ( K2P) channels, namely TASK-1 and TASK-3 (TASK-TWIK related acid sensitive \npotassium channel) . Therefore the aim of the present work was to analyze \nthe role of TASK-1 and TASK-3 channels in controlling the activity modes of the \nthalamocortical neuron. \nMethods:  In the present study we combined electrophysiology with \nimmunohistochemistry in brain slices. Long Evans rats, postnatal age of 13-25 \ndays, were taken as the experimental animals and were handled as approved \nby the local authorities. 250\u00b5M thick coronal thalamic slices were prepared \non a vibratome. Whole cell voltage clamp and current clamp recordings were \nperformed on visually identified TC neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate \nnucleus (dLGN) of the rat thalamus at room temperature. TC neurons were held at \na potential of -28mV and standing outward current (Iso) amplitude was analyzed. \nResults:  Muscarinic signaling to TASK channels in TC neurons depends on \nmuscarinic acetylcholine receptors 1 and 3, M1AChR and M3AChR. Inhibition of \nG-protein signaling results in strong reduction of the muscarinic effect on Iso. This \neffect is comparable to the reduction of muscarinic signaling by inhibiting TASK \nchannels directly (low pH, THA). ATP depletion results in a current run down and a \nreduced muscarinic effect on Iso. Muscarinic signaling mediated through G-alpha \ncoupled phospholipase- PIP2 pathway can change the functional activity of the TC \nneuron by changing the state of TASK channel functioning.\nDiscussion: TASK channels are the leak potassium channels  which contributes \nto the resting membrane potential in many neurons. The modulation of these \nchannels helps in determining the functional activity modes of the TC neurons \nwhich is crucial to understand the mechanism of sleep wake cycle, alertness and \nepileptic seizures.\nFunding: German Research Foundation DFG (BU 1019/8-1/9-1)68Does the proteoglycan NG2 influence neuron-NG2 cell synaptic signaling?\nS. Passlick1, K. Karram2, J. Trotter3, G. Seifert1, C. Steinh\u00e4user1, R. Jabs1\n1 Institute of Cellular Neurosciences, University of Bonn, Germany 2 Institute \nfor Molecular Medicine, University of Mainz, Germany 3 Molecular Cell Biology, \nUniversity of Mainz, Germany\nIntroduction: Glial cells expressing the proteoglycan NG2 are widely distributed \nthroughout the developing and adult gray and white matter of the CNS. Several \nproperties distinguish them from astrocytes, mature oligodendrocytes and \nmicroglia. NG2 cells express different types of voltage-gated K+, Na+, and Ca2+-\nchannels. They also express a variety of ligand-gated receptors including group I \nmetabotropic glutamate receptors and ionotropic AMPA- and GABAA-receptors. \nFurthermore, NG2 cells are the only non-neuronal cells in the CNS that form \nsynapses with neurons. In this respect, it is interesting that the NG2 protein (i) \nbinds to the postsynaptic Glutamate Receptor Interaction Protein (GRIP) and (ii) \ncontains two Laminin G/Neurexin/Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (LNS) domains \nin the extracellular region. GRIP is considered important for clustering of the \nGluR2 subunit of AMPA receptors. LNS domains are characteristic for postsynaptic \nneurexins that, by binding to presynaptic neuroligins, are important for synapse \nformation in neurons.\nIn this study we asked whether the NG2 protein is crucial for the formation of \nfunctional NG2 cell synapses, by influencing clustering of postsynaptic receptors.\nMethods:  We investigated synaptic transmission between glutamatergic neurons \nand NG2 cells in NG2-EYFP-knockin (+/- and -/-) and wildtype littermate mice (p8-\n14). Whole-cell membrane currents from hippocampal NG2 cells were recorded \nduring electrical stimulation of Schaffer collaterals in presence of the GABAA-\nreceptor blocker picrotoxin and the kinetics of the evoked excitatory postsynaptic \ncurrents (eEPSCs) were analyzed subsequently. By applying paired-pulse protocols \nand determining the paired-pulse ratio we also investigated short-time synaptic \nplasticity at neuron-NG2 cell synapses of the different genotypes.\nResults:  NG2 cells from mice of the different genotypes exhibited time-correlated \neEPSCs upon Schaffer Collateral stimulation. Comparison of the rise- and decay \ntime of these eEPSCs revealed no significant differences among the tested \ngenotypes. Furthermore NG2 cells possess a strong paired-pulse facilitation \nwhich is not influenced by a loss of the NG2 proteoglycan.\nDiscussion: We conclude that the NG2 proteoglycan is not necessary for general \nsynapse formation between glutamatergic neurons and NG2 cells in the \nhippocampus. As no significant differences were detectable regarding the kinetics \nof eEPSCs, it is unlikely that subunit composition and AMPA-receptor clustering \nare influenced in NG2-knockout animals. Furthermore, our results suggest that \npresynaptic features are also not affected by a loss of the NG2 protein, since \nshort-term synaptic plasticity is indistinguishable among the tested genotypes. \nIt remains to be tested whether miniature  EPSCs, which are not synchronized by \npresynaptic action potentials, are influenced in NG2-deficient mice.\nFunding: DFG (SPP 1172) and EC (FP7-202167 N euroglia).69How psychosocial stress affects executive functions as measured by the modified \nversion of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.\nStephan Pabst, Daniela Schoofs, Oliver T. Wolf\nDepartment of Cognitive Psychology, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany\nBackground: The involvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in emotion processing \nand executive functioning  is commonly accepted . Studies have shown that \nexecutive functions can be impaired by stress due to interference in frontal lobe \nstructures. To follow up on these results, we investigated if stress would impair \nexecutive functions such as set shifting and concept formation as measured by \nthe modified version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (MCST).\nMethods: 180 (88 female) young and healthy subjects were recruited. Half was \nassigned to a stress group and half to a control group. To induce stress participants \nof the stress group underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) while subjects in \nthe control group underwent the placebo-TSST. As a marker of the activation of \nthe hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis salivary cortisol was measured before \nand after the TSST or placebo-TSST, respectively. The MCST was conducted 35 \nminutes after the TSST.\nResults: Participants from the stress group showed a strong cortisol increase in \nresponse to the stressor, while cortisol concentrations declined in controls. Results \nof the MCST showed a tendency towards improvement within the stress group, \nperforming better concerning non-perseverative errors than the control group (p \n= .115). No difference between the groups could be found for categories finished \nand perseverative errors.\nDiscussion: Results of this large sample suggests that 35 minutes after exposure \nto an acute stressor, executive functions are enhanced rather than impaired. An \nexplanation could be the inverted-u-shape relationship between the level of \nstress and performance.

However, cell survival and functional \nrecovery after transplantation are still limited and the identification of grafted \ncells in situ  remains difficult. \nMETHODS: In this set of studies, we analyzed (i) the physiological function \nof the endogenous FGF-2 system within the nigrostriatal system, (ii) the \ninfluence of Schwann cells (SC) overexpressing 18 kDa and 21/23 kDa FGF-2 co-\ntransplanted with DA micrografts into the caudate-putamen unit of unilaterally \n6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned \u201cparkinsonian\u201d rats and (iii) the transfection of \nmesencephalic neural progenitor cells with both, a neurotrophic factor (FGF-2 \nisoforms) and reporter genes (eGFP, dsRed) using different techniques. \nRESULTS:  In the first study, we examined the number of DA neurons by stereology \nin FGF-2 mutant mice after development and after 6-hydroxydopamine lesion. \nOur results show that FGF-2ko-/- mice reveal more DA neurons within the SNpc \nthan FGF-2ko wildtype. Moreover, we found an increased volume of the SNpc \nin both, FGF-2ko and transgenic FGF-2 mice. Interestingly, the results are vice \nversa after 6-OHDA lesion. In the second study, w e engineered Schwann cells to \noverexpress FGF-2. They promoted DA-graft-induced restoration, whether co-\ntransplanted at the same site or grafted at a second more distant site within the \nCPu. In addition, the 21/23 kDa FGF-2 isoforms resulted in a significantly better \nreinnervation and survival of dopaminergic micrografts when compared to the \n18-kDa FGF-2 isoform. Based on these studies, we expanded and differentiated \nventral mesencephalic precursors towards DA neurons in vitro  and subsequently \ntransplanted these cells into 6-OHDA lesioned rats. We then transfected the stem \ncells in order to provide them with their own trophic factor. Different techniques \nfor transfection were compared, and the highest transfection rate of up to 47% \nwas achieved by nucleofection. Within the group of transfected cells, many \nprogenitors and several neurons were found. To provide the progenitor cells \nwith a neurotrophic factor, different isoforms of fibroblast growth factor-2 were \nintroduced. To follow the behavior of the transfected cells in vitro, functional \ntests such as the cell viability assay (water-soluble tetrazolium salt assay [WST-\n1]) and the cell proliferation assay (5-bromo-2\u2019-deoxyuridine-enzyme-linked \nimmunosorbent assay) were performed. In addition, these transfected cells were \nviable after transplantation, expressed tyrosine hydroxylase in vivo , and could 71easily be detected within the host striatum because of their eGFP expression. Our \nresults suggest that they survive microtransplantation and integrate within the \nstriatum both, shown by both, patch clamp recording and behavioural recovery.\nCONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggest, that FGF-2 plays an important \nphysiological role within the nigrostriatal system and is a potent growth factor \nin stem cell transplantation. This study also indicates, that neural progenitors \nprovide attractive perspectives in neurodegenerative diseases and could be even \nmore promising when transfected with their own neurotrophic factor(s).72Increased blood-brain barrier permeability and brain edema after focal cerebral \nischemia induced by hyperlipidemia: Role of lipid peroxidation and calpain-1/2, \nmatrix metalloproteinase-2/9 and RhoA overactivation\nAyman ElAli, PhD, Thorsten R. Doeppner, MD, Anil Zechariah, MSc, and \nDirk M. Hermann, MD\nDepartment of Neurology, University Hospital Essen, Germany\nBackground: Hyperlipidemia is a highly prevalent risk factor of ischemic stroke. \nIts impact on brain injury and blood-brain barrier permeability has so far not been \nassessed in animal models of ischemic stroke.\nMethods: Wildtype and ApoE-/- mice, fed with normal or cholesterol-rich high-\nfat food, were subjected to 30 min middle cerebral artery occlusion. Ischemic \ninjury, brain edema, IgG extravasation, lipid peroxidation, calpain-1/2, matrix \nmetalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 and RhoA activation, and occludin expression were \nevaluated 24 hours after reperfusion.\nResults:  Cholesterol-rich food, but not ApoE deficiency increased IgG \nextravasation and brain edema, without influencing infarct area and the density \nof DNA fragmented cells. Increased lipid peroxidation and low density lipoprotein \noxidation were noticed in the brain of hyperlipidemic mice that were associated \nwith increased activation of calpain-1/2 and MMP-2/9, overactivation of RhoA \nand its guanine exchange factor LARG, and downregulation of the tight junction \nprotein occludin in cerebral microvessels.\nConclusions: That post-ischemic blood-brain barrier permeability and brain \nedema are increased during hyperlipidemia points towards the importance \nof the recognition and adequate treatment of this highly prevalent risk factor. \nTranslational studies should more adequately mimic risk factors prevalent in \nhuman stroke. \nFunding:  German Research Foundation (HE3173/2-1), grant of Dr.-Werner-\nJackst\u00e4dt-Foundation, and an endowment of the Heinz-Nixdorf-Foundation.73VEGF-induced angiogenesis is followed by improvements of cerebral blood flow, \nenergy metabolism and histological injury in subsequent ischemic stroke\nAnil Zechariah, Ayman ElAli, G\u00fcnter Mies and Dirk M. Hermann\nDepartment of Neurology, University Hospital Essen, Germany\nBackground: VEGF induces cerebral angiogenesis and improves brain injury after \nfocal cerebral ischemia. It was so far unknown if induced angiogenesis improves \ncerebral blood flow during subsequent ischemic episodes. \nMethods:  Wildtype and ApoE-/- mice, fed on normal or cholesterol-rich Western \ndiet were i.c.v. treated with VEGF ( 0.02 \u00b5g/day ) or saline for 3 weeks and \nsubsequently submitted to 90 minutes middle cerebral artery occlusion. After \nreperfusion, changes in cerebral blood flow, protein synthesis, ATP depletion \nand tissue pH were evaluated using regional autoradiography, bioluminescence \nand fluorescence techniques. Angiogenesis, ischemic injury, brain edema, blood-\nbrain barrier integrity and matrix metalloproteinase activity were assessed by \nhistochemistry and zymography.\nResults:  VEGF improved cerebral blood flow in ischemic tissue and decreased \nthe acidic shift in wildtype animals on normal diet but not in ApoE-/- on Western \ndiet. Consistent with this, the metabolic penumbra was increased in wildtype \nanimals on normal diet, while this effect was less pronounced in ApoE-/- mice on \nWestern diet. VEGF reduced infarct size in wildtype animals on normal diet, but \nnot in ApoE-/- mice on Western diet. VEGF did not influence brain swelling but \ndecreased serum IgG extravasation and MMP-9 activation in wildtype, but not in \nApoE-/- mice.\nConclusions:  VEGF-induced angiogenesis enhances cerebral blood flow during \nsubsequent ischemic episodes, thus reducing brain injury. Effects of therapeutic \nangiogenesis are compromised during hypercholesterolemia, which questions the \nconcept of therapeutic angiogenesis under conditions of severe atherosclerosis, \nwhere hypercholesterolemia is highly prevalent. 74Increased neuronal activation of Ras modulates the adverse phenotype in a \nmouse model of Rett syndrome\nDaniela Damen1, Oliver Leske2, Rolf Heumann2 \n1International Graduate School of Neuroscience, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, \nGermany; 2Department of Molecular Neurobiochemistry, Ruhr University Bochum, \nBochum, Germany\nBackground: Mutations in the X-linked gene for Methyl CpG binding protein 2 \n(MeCP2) cause a neurodevelopmental disorder known as Rett Syndrome (RTT), \nwhich mostly affects females. Patients show an apparently normal perinatal \ndevelopment within 6-18 months of age. This is followed by a period of regression, \nwith progressive loss of motor capabilities, language and cognitive functions. \nMeCP2-Knockout mouse models mimic key clinical features of RTT, including \ndevelopmental regression leading to motor impairment, irregular breathing, and \nearly mortality. Expression of MeCP2 increases during postnatal development \nwith neuronal maturation, and this correlates with the onset of RTT symptoms. \nWithin this study we were interested in the influence of enhanced neuronal Ras \nactivity on the RTT phenotype.\nMethods:  In order to investigate the effects of elevated neuronal Ras activity \nin RTT, we crossbred MeCP2-KO mice and transgenic mice expressing activated \nhuman Val12 Ha-Ras under the direction of the synapsin I promoter, selectively in \nneurons (Heumann et al. 2000). The phenotype of double transgenic animals was \ninvestigated in several models of animal behaviour. Besides animal behaviour, \nthe effect of MeCP2-KO on the Ras signalling cascade was investigated by a Ras \npulldown assay.\nResults: The crossbreeding of heterozygous MeCP2+/--females with transgenic \nsynRas-males lead to a dramatically increased lethality. Furthermore, other \nthan heterozygous MeCP-/y-males double transgenic synRas/MeCP-/y-males did \nnot survive beyond postnatal day 28. However, double transgenic female mice \ndeveloped an altered anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze comparable \nto that of symptomatic MeCP2-/y-males. \nMeCP2-KO animals did not show any alterations in the activity of Ras or \ndownstream effector proteins compared to wildtype littermates.\nDiscussion:  We conclude that enhanced neuronal Ras activity aggravates the \nRTT phenotype in an animal model of RTT, although a MeCP2-KO is not able to \ninduce changes of the Ras/MAPK signalling cascade. The results are discussed \nin the context of the otherwise protective function of neuronal Ras activation \nfound previously in chemical and mechanical lesion models of the nervous system \n(Heumann et al. 2000).\nFunding: IGSN, Research School75The role of primary cilia in the development of dopaminergic neurons in the \nmurine ventral midbrain\nMary Gazea1, Christian Gojak2, Julia Franzen2, Kerry L. Tucker2 and Sandra Blaess1\n1Neurodevelopmental Genetics, Institute of Reconstructive Neurobiology, Life \nand Brain Cen ter, University of Bonn, Sigmund-Freud-Str. 25, 53127 Bonn \n2Interdisciplinary Center for Neurosciences and Department of Anatomy, University \nof Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany \nIntroduction: Midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra \nand the ventral tegmental area play critical roles in the control of voluntary \nmovement and reward behavior, respectively. DA neurons develop from the floor \nplate of the ventral midbrain. Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling is essential for the \ninduction of DA progenitors. Shh downstream signaling is mediated by the Gli \nzinc finger transcription factors Gli2 and Gli3. Studies in spinal cord and forebrain \nhave shown that Shh signaling occurs in primary cilia and that Gli2 and Gli3 are \nnot functional in absence of primary cilia. It was shown that primary cilia have \na special kind of transport system, which depends on intraflagellar transport \nproteins (IFTs). IFTs are not only required for ciliary transport, but also for \nciliogenesis. To investigate whether primary cilia are important for Shh signaling \nin ventral midbrain development, transgenic mice were analyzed, in which IFT88 \nprotein was either severely reduced ( cobblestone  mutation) or completely absent \n(conditional inactivation of Ift88 ). The phenotypes were then compared with the \nphenotypes of mice, in which Gli2  and Gli3  were inactivated. \nMethods:  Ventral midbrain development was analyzed using \nimmunohistochemistry and RNA in situ hybridization in the following mutants: \na) Cobblestone (cbs)  mutants, which have reduced levels of IFT88 protein, b) \nconditional knock-out mice, in which the Ift88  allele ( Ift88 cko) was inactivated \nin the midbrain after E8.5 (about a day after the onset of Shh signaling), and c) \nmutants with a conditional deletion of Gli2  and Gli3  (Gli2/3 cko). The morphology \nof primary cilia in the Ift88  mutants was investigated with scanning electron \nmicroscopy. \nResults: Cbs mutants do not develop beyond embryonic day (E) 12.5. Analysis of \nE10.5-12.5 ventral midbrain showed that the number of DA neurons and their \nprogenitors was severely reduced and disorganized. Previous studies have shown \nthat DA progenitors are not induced in Shh null mutants, suggesting that residual \nShh signaling might occur in Cbs mutants. In the midbrain of Ift88 cko mutants, \nin which is Ift88  is fully inactivated, primary cilia were reduced in number and \ndeformed. In addition, Shh signaling appeared to be abolished. Ift88 cko mice \ndeveloped to term, allowing the analysis of DA neuron development up to E18.5. \nThe E18.5 midbrain of Ift88 cko mice had a smaller DA progenitor domain and \nthe number of DA neurons was reduced. DA neurons and progenitors were also \nreduced in Gli2/3 cko embryos. Interestingly, the reduction of DA neurons in Gli2/3 \ncko embryos was more severe than in Ift88 cko mutants. \nConclusion: The data obtained from this study show that Ift88  plays an important 76role in the induction of ventral midbrain DA neurons, likely by maintaining \nfunctional primary cilia and consequently normal levels of Shh signaling. \nInterestingly, the phenotypes observed upon loss of IFT88 protein and primary \ncilia are milder than in mutants with inactivated Shh signaling. This suggests that \nlow levels of Shh signaling might persist in absence of IFT88 protein. \nFunding: NRW R\u00fcckkehrerprogramm77Pattern Classification on fMRI-data: A diagnostic approach on psychiatric \ndisorders\nDominik Grotegerd1, Thomas Suslow1,2, Jochen Bauer1, Patricia Ohrmann1, Volker \nArolt1, Anja Stuhrmann1, Walter Heindel2, Harald Kugel2, Udo Dannlowski1\nUniversity of M\u00fcnster, 1Department of Psychiatry, 3Department of Clinical Radiology\n2University of Leipzig, Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy\nIntroduction: Pattern classification techniques have become of growing interest \nin fMRI research. While early approaches mainly concentrated on within-subjects-\nclassification, recent works also address the diagnostics of psychiatric disorders, \nlike the prediction of depressive patients and controls. This work addresses for the \nfirst time the challenge to discriminate fMRI data between unipolar and bipolar \ndepressive patients by using support vector machines.\nMethods: A 3T-Scanner was used to collect fMRI data from 10 patients with \nunipolar disorder and 10 patients with bipolar disorder, both groups currently in an \nactual depressive state. In a passive viewing task emotional faces were presented \nduring the measurement. After standard pre-processing contrast images were \ngenerated (negative > neutral; happy > neutral). The contrast images were masked \nby the most important structures associated with emotion processing (PFC, ACC, \namygdala, ventral striatum). These extracted patterns were entered as input for a \nsupport vector machine. Cross validation was performed to calculate the accuracy \nand statistical significance was determined by permutation tests. Afterwards, \ndiscriminative maps were extracted from chosen classifiers to identify regions of \nthe trained patterns, which were mainly responsible for a successful classification.\nResults: The contrast \u201chappy faces vs. neutral faces\u201d achieved an accuracy of \n90% (p=0.003), while the classifier trained with \u201cnegative faces vs. neutral faces\u201d \nwas able to identify 75% correctly (p=0.04). Finally, a classifier trained with \nboth contrast images as one input pattern has an accuracy of 80%. Extracted \ndiscriminative maps reveal contrary activations in the amygdala, i.e. unipolar \ndepressive patients react stronger on negative faces, while bipolar depressive \npatients show higher activity in the amygdala during the presentation of positive \nfaces.\nDiscussion: The findings of discriminative maps support common theories, \nwhere the neurobiological causes of these psychiatric disorders are supposed to \ndiffer. For instance it can be assumed, that bipolar disorders lead to an enhanced \ndysfunctional identification of emotional stimuli, while unipolar disorder tend to \namygdala activities which are more restricted but enhanced to negative stimuli. \nAlthough the sample size is \u2013 especially in regard to pattern classification \u2013 very \nsmall, this proof of concept shows a possible future application in psychiatric \ndiagnostics.\nFunding: The study was supported by grants of Innovative Medizinische Forschung \n(IMF AR510403 to VA, IMF DA120309 to UD and IMF DA211012 to UD) and Rolf-\nDierichs-Stiftung (ZUW80037 to UD).787 Tesla Ultrahochfeldbildgebung des intrakraniellen arteriellen Gef\u00e4\u00dfsystems: \nnative versus kontrastmittelgest\u00fctzte MPRAGE\nUmutlu L1,2 , Theysohn N1,2, Maderwald S1,2, Wrede K3, Damman P3, Ladd ME1,2, \nLauenstein TC1,2, Goericke SL1,2, Forsting M1,2 , Schlamann M1,2\n1 Institut f\u00fcr Diagnostische und Interventionelle Radiologie und Neuroradiologie, \nUniversit\u00e4tsklinikum Essen\n2 Erwin L.

It acts as modulator of antigen \npresenting cells and thus is a FDA approved drug for the treatment of relapsing \nremitting multiple sclerosis. Recent studies imply that GA may also exert \nneuroprotective effects via an increased BDNF expression in immune cells (Linker \net al., 2010).\nMethods:  3-4 week old female R6/2 mice were immunized subcutaneously with \n0.25 mg GA in complete Freund\u00b4s adjuvant (CFA) or with 0.2 mg of ovalbumin \nor 0.05 mg myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35-55 (MOG) in CFA as \ncontrols. Mice were weighed and clinically monitored to obtain survival curves. \nMotor impairment was evaluated by accelerating rotarod and by assessing \nthe clasping score. Histological analyses included immunohistochemistry for \nubiquitin, BDNF, the neuronal marker NeuN and microglial activation markers. \nQuantitative real time PCR was performed to investigate BDNF expression.\nResults:  In R6/2 mice, treatment with GA prevents weight loss over time. Moreover, \nimmunization with GA or MOG leads to a prolonged survival (median survival \nin the GA treated group 102 days or 99 days in MOG immunized mice vs. 92.5 \ndays in the control group, p = 0.02 by log rank test) and to an attenuated motor \nimpairment as measured by the clasping score or in a rotarod analysis. GA treated \nR6/2 mice display a twofold higher BDNF expression in the brain as compared \nto controls. Blinded quantification of neuronal densities in the motor cortex \nand the basal ganglia, as well as immunohistochemistry for ubiquitin, reveal \nlower numbers of degenerating neurons after GA treatment, while numbers of \nhuntingtin aggregates were not altered.  \n \nConclusion: Treatment with GA ameliorates the disease course in a model of HD. \nFurther studies with this well-tolerated compound are warranted to investigate \nits efficacy in HD.80Establishment of a slice culture model for excitotoxicity.  \nMayorenko I1,2, Gerardo-Nava J1,3, Weis J1, Brook GA1\n1RWTH Aachen University Hospital,Institute of Neuropathology. 2L\u00fcbeck University, \nDepartment of Biomedical Engineering. 3Maastricht University, School of Mental \nHealth and Neurosciences. \nIntroduction : We are interested establishing the technique of using organotypic \nslice culture as a model of experimental neurodegeneration to mimic some of \nthe events associated with traumatic spinal cord injury or with amyotrophic \nlateral sclerosis.  This approach would facilitate studies of pathophysiological \nmechanisms in complex tissues while minimising the number of animals required \nfor such studies and reducing the associated costs. Others have established \nsimilar organotypic models using hippocampal slice cultures (Roehl et al. 2010) \nor more recently using spinal cord slice preparations (Guzman-Lenis et al. 2009). \nThe present experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effects of \nglutamate induced motoneuronal death in such slice preparations in serum-free \nmedium as well as the neuroprotective effects of serum-containing medium. \nMethods : Lumbar organotypic slices (350\u00b5m thick) obtained from 7-9 day old \nSprague-Dawley rats were grown in either Neurobasal A medium supplemented \nwith B27 or in Eagle\u2019s Modified Esential Medium supplemented with Hank\u2019s \nBalanced Salt Solution (25%) and horse serum (25%). Cultures were maintained in \nvitro  for up to 14 days, after which they were incubated in different concentrations \nof glutamate (50\u00b5M-2mM) for 30 minutes and thereafter allowed to recover \nfor an additional 48 hours. The ensuing neurodegeneration was assessed by \nquantifying of the uptake of propidium iodide (PI, 1\u00b5g/ml for 30 min) into the \nnuclei of damaged cells before and after the glutamate insult. Furthermore, \nastrocytic and motoneuronal responses were determined quantitatively following \ndouble immunofluorescence for Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and non-\nphosphorylated 200kDa neurofilament (SMI 32). Stained samples were visualised \nusing either routine epifluorescnece microscopy or 2 photon confocal microscopy.\nResults : Organotypic spinal cord slices maintained for 14 days in either serum-\nfree or serum containing medium demonstrated little or no spontaneous uptake \nof PI, indicating the generally healthy state of the preparations maintained under \neither condition. Short term exposure of slices to increasing concentrations \nglutamate (50\u00b5M, 100\u00b5M or 500\u00b5M), caused widespread and extensive uptake \nof PI in preparations maintained in serum free conditions. Quantification of SMI32 \nimmunofluorescence demonstrated that such elevated PI signals were associated \nwith a clear reduction of neurofilament containing motoneurons in the ventral \nhorn. Exposure of spinal cord slices to elevated glutamate levels (up to 2mM) in \nserum-containing medium had no such effect. PI uptake in such samples was \nnegligible and the numbers of SMI32-positive motoneurons was indistinguishable \nfrom control samples. \nConclusions: We believe that the establishment of this technique and a \nbetter understanding of the cell-cell interactions that it supports will allow \nthe development of future investigations into drug- and cell-mediated \nneuroprotective effects.   81Establishment of an in vitro  system for the evaluation of axon growth promoting \nproperties of 3D bioengineered scaffolds\nGerardo-Nava J1,2, Grehl T3, Steinbusch HWM 2 , Weis J1, Brook GA1.\n1RWTH Aachen University Hospital, Institute of Neuropathology. 2Maastricht \nUniversity, School of Mental Health and Neurosciences. 3Ruhr-University-Bochum, \nDepartment of Neurology. \nIntroduction:  An in vitro  model capable of studying the axon growth promoting \nproperties of 3D biomaterials will be useful in the development of scaffolds for \nthe repair of traumatically injured peripheral nervous system (PNS) tissues. The \nwell preserved cytoarchitectural organization of spinal cord organotypic slice \ncultures (SCOSC) as well as hemisected dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are being used to \ndetermine the orientated motor- and sensory axon growth promoting properties \nof a 3D collagen scaffold.\nMethods:  Cervical organotypic slices (350\u00b5m thick) and hemisected DRG, obtained \nfrom 7-9 day old Sprague-Dawley rats were combined with collagen matrices \ncontaining orientated microchannels (Matricel GmbH, up to 5mm long). Cultures \nwere maintained for up to 21 days, after which they were fixed by immersion  \nin 4% PFA (1 hour), permeabilized with 95% acetic alcolohol and processed for \nimmunhistochemistry using antibodies against the 200kDa non-phosphorylated \nneurofilament epitope (NF200, antibody SMI32), \u03b13-Tubulin (TUBB3), low affinity \nnerve growth factor receptor (NGFr/p75), intracellular calcium binding protein \n(S100), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the ionized calcium binding adaptor \nmolecule 1 (IBA1), and ED1. Samples were then observed using 2-photon scanning \nconfocal microscopy (Olympus) to evaluate the extent and orientation of axonal \ngrowth, as well as cell-axon interactions taking place between migrating cells and \nregenerating axons within the scaffold. \nResults:  Sensory neurons from hemisected DRGs extended long and highly \norientated SMI32-positive axons along the Matricel collagen microchannels. \nAxons that reached the dorsal horn of the SCOSC crossed the scaffold-SCOSC \ninterface and matrix crossing it and exploring the target tissue of the DH of the \nSCOSC. Similarly, ventral horn motor neuron axons (also SMI-32 positive) from the \nslice cultures extend along the scaffold. In both cases, a close interaction between \nregenerating axonal profiles and NGFr/p75-postive Schwann cells could be seen. \nCell migration into the collagen scaffold was strong in both experimental set-ups \nand included migration by cells that were immunoreactive for NGFr/p75, S100, \nIBA1 and ED1. A more limited degree of GFAP-positive  astrocyte migration was \nobserved close to the SCOSC-scaffold interface\nConclusions: Earlier in vitro  investigations have focused largely on cell-substrate \ninteractions using cell suspensions and 2D biomaterials. As the field of biomaterial \nresearch advances in the development of 3D scaffolds, the utilization of in vitro  \nmodels capable of analyzing the tissue-scaffold interactions may generate much \nuseful information. In particular, it is hoped that such approaches will eventually \nreduce the number of in vivo  experiments required in the development of \nbioengineering strategies intended for PNS repair.  82Modality-dependent Experience Modulates Event-related Potentials in Response \nto Novel Tools\nR\u00fcther NN1, Bellebaum C1.\n1Dept. of Neuropsychology, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, \nRuhr University Bochum\nIntroduction:  The organization of semantic knowledge in the brain is a central \nissue of current neuropsychological research. Domain-specific theories argue \nthat evolutionary pressures resulted in a categorical organization. In contrast, \nthe \u201csensory-functional theory\u201d suggests a modality-specific organization of \nconceptual knowledge. The latter account predicts that the dominant modality \nof experience with objects determines their neural representation. In fact, it has \nbeen shown that the training to use novel manipulable objects leads to a neural \nrepresentation in fronto-parietal brain regions and that properties that are \ndifferentially weighted for the distinctiveness of category-membership influence \nthe formation of conceptual knowledge. The present study aimed to directly \ninvestigate the influence of different types of experience on new neural object \nrepresentations. \nMethods:  Participants completed a visual match-mismatch task with pictures \nof novel manipulable objects before and after they received modality-specific \ntrainings with the objects: In three training sessions participants visually explored \none set of objects (visually trained objects - VTO) and manipulated another set of \nobjects (manipulation trained objects - MTO). A third set was not part of the training \nand served as a control condition (no training objects - NTO). During the match-\nmismatch task, brain activity was recorded by means of electroencephalography.\nResults:  Overall, event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to pictures of novel \ntools were comparable between object sets. After training, the N400, an ERP \ncomponent related to semantic processing, was significantly reduced for VTO, \nbut not MTO and NTO at electrode site F3 over the left frontal cortex. In addition, \nthere was evidence of N400 enhancement over right frontal sites for MTO relative \nto the other object sets. \n  \nConclusion:  The results suggest that experience within different modalities with \nnovel manipulable objects leads to differential weighting of those modalities \nin conceptual representations, dependent on the dominant modality during \nconceptual knowledge acquisition. \nFunding:  \nThis work was funded by a grant (SFB 874) from the German Research Federation \n(Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG).  83Neuronal Correlates of Performance-Related Feedback in Young and Elderly \nPeople\nB.

Several studies show an association between neural activity in \nspecific brain regions (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex) and the valence of a \nfeedback (Nieuwenhuis, 2005; Van Veen, 2004). It remains to be elucidated, if \nsuch differential activation is age dependent or not. Hence, the present study \ninvestigates how performance-related feedback is neuronally processed in young \nand elderly people. Moreover, we aim at investigating whether positive and \nnegative feedback show age-related differential neuronal effects.\nMethods\nIn this study 16 young men (M= 25.2 \u00b1 5.0 years of age) and 16 seniors (M= 69.4 \n\u00b1 3.8 years of age) participated. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging \nthe volunteers were investigated while performing a modified Flanker-task in the \nscanner environment. As a function of their individual performance participants \nreceived a positive, negative or neutral feedback after each trial of the task.\nResults\nBehavioural data reveal a significant influence of feedback on subsequent trials. \nOn the neuronal level significant main effects of feedback and age could be found. \nHowever, the interaction did not reach significance. In comparison to negative \nfeedback, positive feedback was associated with stronger activation of putmanen, \ngyrus frontalis and anterior cingulate cortex. Older participants showed stronger \nactivation of middle and inferior gyrus frontalis compared to younger subjects.\nDiscussion\nThe reward system was similarly activated in younger and older participants, \nwhich implies that feedback can serve as reward both in young and elderly people.84Human mirror neuron system and emotions in Parkinson Disease \nAnna Pohl1,3, Silke Anders4, Kathrin Reetz3, Hong Chen2,3, Harshal Patel2,3, Klaus \nMathiak1 & Ferdinand Binkofski2,3\n1Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy, and Psychosomatics, RWTH Aachen \nUniversity; 2Section for Neurological Cognition Research and 3Department of \nNeurology, RWTH Aachen University; 4Department of Neurology, University L\u00fcbeck\nBackground:  Besides the classical triad of motor symptoms, Parkinson Disease \n(PD) is characterized by cognitive and affective impairments. For example, a \nfacial emotion recognition deficit has often been reported. Up to now, neural \nmechanisms underlying this affective impairment are not well understood. \nCurrent neuroimaging studies suggest that perception and execution of motor \nacts (i.e. emotional facial expressions) are closely linked by a special class of \nvisuomotor neurons (mirror neurons) in the ventrolateral premotor cortex (pars \nopercularis) and that the activation of these neurons during perception triggers \nintention understanding. The goal of our study was to examine the neural \ncorrelates of emotion processing in PD with a specific focus on the probable \nhuman mirror neuron system.  \nMethods:  Nine patients with PD and nine matched controls underwent functional \nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The fMRI experiment was implemented as a \ntwo-by-three factorial design with the factors task (observation of facial gestures, \nexpression of facial gestures) and type of facial gesture (happy: smile, non-\nemotional: lip protrusion, neutral: relaxed expression without movement). Short \nvideo clips depicting actors expressing different facial gestures and scrambled \nvideo clips were used as stimulus material. Participants were instructed to \nobserve whenever they saw the actors and to execute whenever they saw the \nscrambled videos. After scanning, participants were asked to complete a short \nneuropsychological test battery and a facial emotion recognition task. In addition, \nthey had to rate how much happiness they experienced during each condition. \nResults:  In our preliminary data analysis we found conjoint activation for \nobservation and expression of the emotional facial gesture in visual and frontal \nareas, in the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), the left amygdala, and \nthe right superior parietal lobule, when data were pooled across all participants. \nIn the group comparison, region of interest analysis revealed weaker activation \nof the right pars opercularis during observation of the emotional facial gesture in \npatients with PD.  \nDiscussion: The results of our study provide evidence for altered neural processing \nof emotional facial expressions in patients with PD. It is possible that decreased \nactivation of pars opercularis during observation of emotional facial gestures \nimpedes facial emotion recognition that is impaired in patients with PD. Further \nanalyses are needed to relate the altered neural processing to the performance in \nthe emotion recognition task.   \nFunding:  Federal Ministry of Education and Research [ 01GW0752 ]85Synaptic plasticity in the lateral Amygdala in GAD65-deficient mice\nMaren D Lange, Kay J\u00fcngling, Stefano Gaburro and Hans-Christian Pape\nInstitut f\u00fcr Physiologie I, Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster\nBackground: GABAergic mechanisms are crucial for aversive signal processing in the \namygdala. Availability of GABA as a transmitter is determined by the rate-limiting \nenzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), which exists in two isoforms GAD67 \nand GAD65. GAD67 is responsible for metabolic GABA synthesis, whereas GAD65 \nseems to be the more synaptic activity-dependent isoform. In fact, genetically \ndetermined deficiency of GAD65 results in increased anxiety, generalization of \nconditioned fear and impairment of fear extinction (Bergado-Acosta et al., 2008; \nSangha et al., 2009).  Therefore the present study was undertaken to characterize \nthe functional role of GAD65 in synaptic transmission and plasticity in the lateral \namygdala (LA). \nMethods:  Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in acute brain slices \ncontaining the LA of GAD65 deficient mice (GAD65-/-) and age-matched wild-type \nlittermates (GAD65+/+) prepared in vitro , and after Pavlovian fear conditioning ex \nvivo . \nResults: Obtained results indicate that GAD65 deficiency is associated with ( i) \na significant decrease in efficacy of evoked GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic \nresponses, whereas glutamatergic responses were unaffected, ( ii) an impairment \nof long term plasticity at monosynaptic GABAergic inputs, and ( iii) a shift from \na heterosynaptic associative form of long-term potentiation (LTP) at cortico-\nthalamic inputs to non-associative forms, which could be mimicked in GAD65+/+ \nby application of CGP55845 blocking presynaptic GABAB receptors. Importantly, \ngeneralized fear obtained upon over-training in GAD65+/+ resulted in a shift from \nassociative to non-associative forms of LTP similar to that observed in GAD65-/-. \nDiscussion: These data support the notion that GAD65 is a critical element for \nproviding sufficient amounts of GABA during periods of increased demands such \nas high synaptic activity. Since lowered GAD plasma activity and polymorphisms \nin the GAD2 gene-region have been associated with risk factors for anxiety \ndisorders (Unschuld et al., 2009), these findings raise the possibility that GAD65 \nenzyme dysfunction could be a pathogenic factor in panic disorder.86Pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells as stable source of human \noligodendrocytes\nRaphaela L\u00fcnskens, Julia Fischer, Kim Erwes, Michael Peitz, Tamara Quandel and \nOliver Br\u00fcstle \nInstitute of Reconstructive Neurobiology Life & Brain Center, University of Bonn, \nBonn, Germany\nBackground:  The damage and loss of oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells \nof the central nervous system, are symptomatic for demyelinating pathologies \nincluding multiple sclerosis, leucodystrophies, stroke and spinal cord injury. \nThus, efficient generation of human oligodendrocytes (OL) in vitro  can provide \ninteresting prospects for basic research, screening applications for OL-specific \ncompounds and eventually the development of stem cell-based therapies for \ndiseases requiring OL replacement. In recent years, embryonic stem cells (hESC) \nhave emerged as particularly versatile and unlimited source of neural donor cells. \nIn addition, reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells \n(iPSC) provides fascinating prospects to generate patient-specific PSC. However, \nwhile the generation of neural precursors and differentiated neurons from human \nPSC is well established, efficient differentiation into oligodendrocyte precursor \ncells (OPC) and modeling of myelin disorders still poses a significant challenge. \nMethods:  For neural induction hESC and hiPSC were cultured as floating \naggregates and differentiated in a three-step protocol in medium with decreasing \nconcentrations of retinoic acid. After 28 days the aggregates were plated on \nMatrigel-coated tissue culture dishes and cells with stem cell properties were \nisolated on the basis of the expression of the neural stem cell (NSC) marker \nCD133 by FACSorting. The NSC fate and regional identity of the isolated \ncells were characterized at the transcript and protein level. Defined in vitro  \ndifferentiation conditions, in particular for efficient OL differentiation, were used \nto assess the tripotential differentiation capacity into neurons, astrocytes and OL. \nTransplantation studies into neonatal shi/shi \u00b4 rag2-/- mice were performed to \nexamine the functional properties of OL in vivo . \nResults:  We were able to establish an adherent and clonogenic population of \ngliogenic NSC from hESC and hiPSC. These glioNSC express markers characteristic \nof neural stem/radial glial cells. They exhibit prominent expression of region-\nspecific transcription factors typically found in the posterior hindbrain and \nanterior spinal cord. Expression patterns of transcription factors specific for \ndorsal, intermediate and ventral progenitors suggest that glioNSC are not \nrestricted to a dorsal or ventral fate. Upon growth factor withdrawal glioNSC \nexhibit tripotential differentiation into neurons, astrocytes and OL. Notably, using \ndefined differentiation conditions that induce strong expression of the OL-specific \ntranscription factors OLIG1/2, NKX6.2 and SOX10, glioNSC can be converted into \ncultures highly enriched in NG2-positive OPC, which further differentiate into \nO4+, GalC+ und MBP+ OL. Furthermore, upon transplantation into neonatal shi/\nshi x rag2-/- mice glioNSC-derived OL undergo full maturation and ensheath host \naxons.87Discussion: The generation of glioNSC provides for the first time a direct and \nstable source of human OL. Translation of our differentiation paradigm to iPSC \nfrom patients suffering from myelin disorders will offer interesting prospects for \nstudying cell-autonomous pathomechanisms directly in human OL. 88Effects of inflammatory cytokines and minocycline on cultured neural stem cells\nSabine Ulrike Jantzen, Sophia Muesken, Michael Schroeter, Gereon R Fink, \nMaria Adele Rueger\nKlinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Neurologie, Uniklinik K\u00f6ln\nIntroduction:  Manipulating endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult \nbrain has emerged as an experimental concept, aimed at enhancing the brain\u2019s \nregenerative capacity after insults such as stroke. Neuroinflammatory processes \noccuring after stroke are mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\nalpha, interleukin-1\u00df (IL-1\u00df) and IL-6; however, their effects on NSCs are unknown \nto date. The tetracycline minocycline has neuroprotective effects in stroke, but \u2013 \nlikewise \u2013 its effects on NSCs are unclear to date.\nMethod: NSCs were dissected from fetal rat cortex (E13.5) and grown as monolayer \ncultures in an undifferentiated state in the presence of fibroblast growth factor 2 \n(FGF2). To study the effects of various pharmacological agents on NSCs, cultures \nwere treated with various concentrations or combinations of TNF-alpha, IL-1\u00df, IL-6, \nand minocycline, and NSC numbers were assessed over time using a photometric \nassay (MTT). To assess the effects of drugs on NSC proliferation, treated cells \nwere exposed to bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 6hrs, and then stained for BrdU \nincorporation. The differentiation potential of NSCs was assessed by withdrawing \nFGF2 for 10 days, followed by immunocytochemical stainings for the three \npotential fates of NSCs (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes).\nResults: 10\u00b5M and 50\u00b5M of minocycline significantly increased NSC numbers \nover 48 hours compared to control conditions. This effect could not be attributed \nto an increase in NSC proliferation as assessed by the BrdU-assay, thus indicating a \npositive effect of minocycline on the survival of NSCs. Minocycline did not affect \nthe differentiation potential of NSCs, as all three cell fates were generated in the \nsame distribution observed in control cells. A cocktail of the pro-inflammatory \ncytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1\u00df and IL-6 did neither affect NSC numbers nor their \nproliferative activity. However, pro-inflammatory cytokines did accelerate the \ndifferentiation of NSCs, and promoted a glial fate.\nConclusion:  Our data suggest that certain concentrations of the neuroprotective \ndrug minocycline positively affect NSC survival while keeping cells in the tri-\npotential, undifferentiated state. On the other hand, the pro-inflammatory \ncytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1\u00df, and IL-6 accelerated NSC differentiation toward a \nglial fate. These results should help to establish novel (combinatory) treatments \ntargeting the endogenous NSC niche in stroke.89Beeinflussung der zentralen Schmerzverarbeitung durch Nikotin und Koffein\nAnke Heber, Dagny Holle, Hans-Christoph Diener, Zaza Katsarava, \nMark Obermann\nKlinik und Poliklinik  f\u00fcr Neurologie, Universtit\u00e4t Duisburg-Essen\nHintergrund : Die Wirkungen von Nikotin und Koffein auf das schmerzverarbeitende \nSystem werden in der Literatur kontrovers diskutiert, wobei sowohl analgetische als \nalgetische Effekte beschrieben sind. So werden z.B. koffeinhaltige Mischanalgetika \nzur Schmerztherapie insbesondere von Kopfschmerzerkrankungen eingesetzt.\nZiel dieser Studie ist, den Einfluss von Nikotin und Coffein auf die trigeminale \nSchmerzverarbeitung an gesunden Probanden mittels trigeminaler schmerz-\nevozierter Potentiale (PREP) sowie des nozizeptiven Blinkreflexes (nBR) zu \nuntersuchen. \nMethodik : Die Schmerzstimulation erfolgt mittels einer planaren Kupfer-Platin-\nElektrode, die eine spezifische Stimulation der  A \u03b1-Fasern des nozizeptiven Systems \nerlaubt. Die Applikation des Schmerzreizes erfolgt im Bereich der Stirn (V1) \nbeidseits. PREP und nBR k\u00f6nnen simulatan abgeleitet werden, so dass gleichzeitig \neine Untersuchung des trigeminalen Schmerzsystems auf Hirnstammebene (nBR) \naber auch supraspinal (PREP) erfolgen kann. Diese Untersuchung  wird sowohl vor \nals auch nach der Einnahme von 0,4mg Koffein oder dem Rauchen einer Zigarette \ndurchgef\u00fchrt, so dass die interindividuellen aber auch die intraindividuellen \nNikotin- und Koffeinabh\u00e4ngigen Unterschiede bestimmt werden k\u00f6nnen.   \nErgebnisse : Bislang wurden 10 gesunde Probanden untersucht. Es zeigten sich \nweder im intraindividuellen noch im interindividuellen Vergleich der Latenzen und \nAmplituden nach Nikotin- oder Koffeineinnahme signifikante Unterschiede. Nach \nAuswertung der bisher erhobenen Daten besteht bei gesunden Probanden weder \neine Fazilitierung noch eine Augmentation der trigeminalen Schmerzverarbeitung \ndurch die zugef\u00fchrten Substanzen.\nDiskussion : Nach Auswertung der bisherigen Daten konnte kein Einfluss von \nKoffein oder Nikotin auf die trigeminale Schmerzverarbeitung gezeigt werden. \nF\u00fcr die Zukunft wird es interessant zu untersuchen, ob sich diese Ergebnisse \nin einem gr\u00f6\u00dferen Probandenkollektiv best\u00e4tigen lassen und ob diese nur f\u00fcr \ngesunde Probanden zutreffen und z.B. Kopfschmerzpatienten ein abweichendes \nVerhalten zeigen.90Voxel based morphometry showing acute alteration in a visual paradigm.\nHolle D, Naegel S, Hagenacker T, Theysohn N, Diener HC, Katsarava Z, Obermann M \nDepartment of Neurology, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany\nIntroduction:  Previous studies used voxel based morphometry (VBM) for imag ing \nlong term alteration within the gray matter of the brain. Increased and decreased \ndensities were reported after special tasks or conditions such as learning to juggle \nor pain application and were interpreted as signs of cerebral neuroplasticity over \ntime. Acute changes of cerebral activation have been only studied by functional \nimaging such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron \nemission tomography (PET). We aimed to  investigate whether VBM can also \ndetect acute changes induced by a simple checkerboard paradigm. \nMethods:  Twenty heal thy subjects were investigated using VBM. Three MRIs were \napplied to each single subject: one before looking at a flickering checkerboard, \none right after looking at the checkerboard, and one 1 hour later. For each subject \na map of grey matter volumetric differences between the scans of different \ntime points was calculated. After within processing all scans of one time point \nwere aligned together and normalized (Dartel algorithm of SPM 8, Matlab 7).  As \ncontrol experiment we performed regular fMRI with checkerboard stimulation in \nall participants. \nResults:  Changes within the primary visual cortex (Brodmann area 17; MNI: \nx= -6, y=-93, z=-3; pFWE=0.043; T=5.08) were detected after application of the \ncheckerboard paradigm and diminished within one hour. A near-by region showed \nactivation in a regular fMRI block design using a checkerboard design. Additionally \ngray matter changes were observed in the secondary visual cortex (Brodmann \narea V5/MT; MNI: x= 59, y=-63, z=7;  pFWE=0.035; T=5.19) one hour after application \nof the checkerboard design.\nConclusion: The observed changes appear to be generated by looking at the \ncheckerboard as they occur in the visual cortex which is known to be activated in \nvisual paradigms of multitudinous previous fMRI and PET studies. Up to now, VBM \nchanges were interpreted as either neuronal growing/degeneration, or dendrite \nspine and synapse turnover, or changes of the extracellular space/ microvascular \nvolume. In contrast to long term VBM alterations, acute VBM changes rather \nseem to reflect actions that must occur much faster than the hithero suggested, \nfor instance water displacement. Further studies are needed to illuminate the \nphysiological background of this observation. This phenomenon might explain \nthe wide diversity of results by different VBM studies not controlling for acute \nchanges or using cross sectional design.91Contiguous gene deletions on chromosome 7 including two factors of the Sonic \nHedgehog signalling pathway, SHH and GLI3, cause clinical corresponding and \noverlapping phenotypes \nAndreas Roos1, Stephan Buchkremer1, Joachim Weis1, Eva Brauers1, Susanne Frank2, \nClaudia Gro\u00df2, Nicolai Kohlschmidt2\n1Institut f\u00fcr Neuropathologie, Uniklinik der RWTH Aachen\n2Institut f\u00fcr Klinische Genetik, Bonn\nIntroduction : Chromosomal disturbances are the most frequent cause of complex \ngenetic diseases including mental retardation, (cranio)facial dysmorphisms and \ncongenital malformations like neurological anomalies. The microarray analysis is \na high resolution technique which allows the identification of small imbalances. \nTherefore, this technique becomes a commonly used diagnostic tool in the \ninvestigation of patients with complex (neurological) phenotypes. \nMethods and Results : With the help of microarray technology, we investigated \ntwo patients with complex phenotype compatible with disturbances in the Sonic \nHedgehog signalling pathway. We were able to identify two different contiguous \ngene deletions on chromosome 7 including SHH  (7q36.2-q36.3; approximately \n4.2 Mb ) and GLI3 (7p14.1-p13; approximately 3 Mb), two factors of the Sonic \nHedgehog  signalling pathway.\nConclusions : A number of severe (neurological) diseases in mammalians are caused \nby disturbances within the Sonic Hedgehog signalling pathway. Although in both of \nthe presented cases divers genes were affected by the heterozygous deletion, the \nphenotype generally fits with the haploinsuffiency of SHH  and GLI3 , respectively. \nWith regard to the fact that SHH and GLI3 belong to the same signalling pathway, \nthe clinical presentation of these patients affirms this on one hand due to clinical \noverlapping hallmarks including brain and cranium malformations as well as a \nshort stature. On the other hand, the patients presented with \u201cindividual\u201d clinical \nsymptoms like muscular hypotonia, heart disturbances, single maxillary incisor, \nand cleft palate (7q36.2-q36.3 deletion including the SHH  gene) or syndactyly and \ndelayed dentition (7p14.1-p13 deletion including the GLI3  gene) or even contrary \ndysmorphisms like hypotelorism and hypertelorism. Furhtermore, the patient \ncarrying the 7q36.2-q36.3 deletion shows the more severe phenotype, also with \nregard to the brain malformations. The varying clinical findings as well as the \ndifference in the severity of the phenotype could be the result of the other genes \naffected by the two deletions on one hand. But on the other hand, they also could \nbe the clinical outcome of the SHH-dependent function of GLI3: while a disturbed \nSHH-signalling leads to a gene repressor function of GLI3, disturbances in the \nquantity of GLI3 more affect its gene activator function. 92Extended SIL1  mutation analysis in Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome increases the \ndetection of pathogeneic alterations and the frequency of diagnosed cases\nStephan Buchkremer1, Jan Senderek1,2, Sabrina Spengler2, Andreas Dufke3, \nMichael Baudis4, Eva Brauers1, Joachim Weis1, Andreas Roos1\n \n1Institut f\u00fcr Neuropathologie, Uniklinik der RWTH Aachen\n2Institut f\u00fcr Humangenetik, Uniklinik der RWTH Aachen\n3Institut f\u00fcr Humangenetik, Eberhard-Karls-Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen\n4Institut f\u00fcr Molekularbiologie, Universit\u00e4t Z\u00fcrich\nIntroduction: Marinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome (MSS) is a rare progressive multisystem \ndisorder with autosomal recessive inheritance. The phenotype is characterized by \ncerebellar ataxia, congenital or infantile cataracts, progressive vacuolar myopathy, \nmental retardation, and short stature. Mutations in the SIL1  gene, which encodes \nan endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident co-chaperone, were identified as a major \ncause of MSS. Up to now, 52 cases with proven SIL1  mutations are published and \nthe primary pathology has remained unknown in apparently non- SIL1 -related \nMSS cases.  \nMethods and Results: We assume that in a part of MSS patients, genetic \nalterations within the SIL1  gene, not detectable with Sanger sequencing, are \nresponsible for the MSS pathology. In order to proof this assumption, we carried \nout an extended SIL1  mutation analysis. With the help of array-CGH and junction \nfragment analysis, were able to identify two different large deletions within the \nSIL1  gene in two patients presenting a classical MSS phenotype. One patient \npresented before with a single heterozygous SIL1  mutation while the other one \nshowed no SIL1  mutations detectable by Sanger sequencing. \nConclusion: Our data extend the mutational spectrum associated with the \nSIL1  gene and highlight the need of extended SIL1  mutation analysis in MSS \ndiagnostics on one hand in MSS cases heterozygous for one SIL1  mutation, and, on \nthe other hand in classical MSS cases without SIL1  mutations detectable by Sanger \nsequencing. Furthermore, our results indicate that SIL1 -related MSS is potentially \nunder-diagnosed due to the limitation of screening procedures customarily used \nin MSS diagnostics.93Neural underpinnings of psychopathy in youth with early onset conduct disorder\nDr. med. Georg von Polier\nDepartment of Child and Adolescsent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, \nRWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany\nBackground:  Early onset conduct disorder (CD) is known to have a poor prognosis \nand a high rate of conversion into antisocial personality disorder. In particular \npsychopathic or callous-unemotional traits are associated with increased violent \nbehaviour and state a risk factor for ongoing antisocial behaviour. Neuroanatomical \nfindings point towards altered volumes of structures of the limbic system, such \nas the hippocampus.  In this structural MRI-study, we investigated hippocampal \nvolumes and hippocampal subfields of youth with early onset conduct disorder \nand psychopathic traits compared to age matched healthy controls. \nMethods:  All subjects underwent 3T-MRI scanning. Hippocampal volumes were \nassessed by means of automated segmentation with FreeSurfer, Version 5.1, \nusing Bayesian interference models. This method further provides volumes \nof hippocampal subfields. Psychopathic traits were assessed by means of the \nAntisocial Process Screening Device (APSD). Age-corrected group comparisons \nfor hippocampal volumes and partial correlations between callous-unemotional \ntraits and hippocampal subfields were calculated.\nResults:  Total hippocampal volume and left hippocampus volume were smaller \nin youth with CD and psychopathic traits compared to healthy controls. Right \nhippocampal volume was by trend smaller in youth with CD and psychopathic \ntraits. Psychopathic traits were associated with smaller volumes of the subiculum \nand the tail of the hippocampus bilateral. \nDiscussion: The findings point towards smaller hippocampal volumes in youth \nwith early onset CD and psychopathic traits. Smaller hippocampal volumes \nas part of the limbic system and are associated with deficits in affect and \nmotivation. Moreover, these data are in accordance with findings of experimental \nstudies proposing that lesions of the dorsal hippocampus impair acquisition of \nconditioned fear. Following theories on psychopathology of psychopathic traits, \ndeficits in emotion processing such as acquisition of fear are central features in \nthe development of psychopathy. 94Habituationsverhalten bei Patienten mit Phobischem Schwankschwindel (PSS)\nB. Schulte Steinberg, D. Holle, S. N\u00e4gel, H.C. Diener, Z. Katsarava, M. Obermann\nKlinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Neurologie, Universit\u00e4t Duisburg-Essen, Deutschland\nHintergrund:  Bei Habituation handelt es sich um eine unbewusste Form des \nLernens, bei der wiederholende Reizapplikationen (z.B. leichte Schmerzen) \nim Rahmen einer Reizgew\u00f6hnung zu einer verminderten Reizreaktion und \n\u2013wahrnehmung im Verlauf f\u00fchren. Diese Gew\u00f6hnung verhindert eine \nReiz\u00fcberflutung durch unbedeutende Reize und hilft die Konzentration des \nOrganismus auf neue m\u00f6glicherweise wichtigere Stimulationseinfl\u00fcsse zu \nwenden. Verschiedene chronische Erkrankungen wie zum Beispiel die Migr\u00e4ne \nzeichnen sich durch ein sogenanntes Habituationsdefizit aus, bei dem eine \nsolche Reizgew\u00f6hnung nicht oder nur unzureichend stattfindet. Der phobische \nSchwankschwindel (PSS) ist die zweith\u00e4ufigste diagnostizierte Schwindelursache. \nPatienten mit PSS leiden unter einem dauerhaft oder episodisch auftretenden \nSchwankschwindel begleitet von subjektiver Stand- und Gangunsicherheit. Die \nzugrunde liegenden pathophysiologischen Mechanismen dieser Erkrankung sind \nbisher weitgehend unbekannt. Das Vorliegen eines Habituationsdefizits bei PSS \nwurde in der Vergangenheit postuliert, aber noch nicht durch Studien belegt. \nZiel dieser Studie ist es zu untersuchen, inwieweit ein Habituationsdefizit bei der \nEntstehung bzw. Unterhaltung des PSS eine Rolle spielt.\nMethode:  Das Habituationsverhalten wurde mittels des nozizeptiven Blinkreflexes \n(nBR) untersucht. Die R2-Antwort des nBR wurde nach schmerzspezifischer \nStimulation der A \u03b1-Fasern im Bereich beider Seiten der Stirn (V1) analysiert. Zur \nUntersuchung der Habituation wurde ein Blockdesign gew\u00e4hlt (10 Bl\u00f6cke je 6 \nSchmerzstimulationen; Blockabstand jeweils 2 Minuten), wobei die R2-Antwort \njeweils in Abh\u00e4ngigkeit vom ersten Block untersucht wurde und die Habituation \nals Abnahme der R2-Antwort der Folgebl\u00f6cke im Vergleich zu Block 1 definiert \nwurde. Die Reizstimulation erfolgte mit einer Stimulationsintensit\u00e4t, die 2x die \nindividuelle Schmerzschwelle betrug, wobei die Schmerzstimulationen > 2mA \nausgeschlossen wurde, um eine A \u03b1-Faser-Koaktivierung zu verhindern. \nErgebnisse:  Bisher wurden von 60 Messungen 16 Patienten mit PSS sowie \n16 Alters- und Geschlechts-gematchte gesunde Probanden untersucht. Die \nbisherigen Auswertungen zeigen einen Trend zu einem Habituationsdefizit in der \nPatientengruppe im Vergleich zur gesunden Vergleichsgruppe. Eine eindeutige \nAussage kann jedoch erst nach Erh\u00f6hung der Fallzahl (geplant 30 PSS und 30 \ngesunde Kontrollen) gemacht werden. \nDiskussion:  Unsere vorl\u00e4ufige Auswertung detet einen Trend zu einem \nHabituationsdefizit bei Patienten mit PSS an, der ein Bestandteil der \npathophysiologischen Grundlagen dieser Erkrankung darstellen k\u00f6nnte. Zum \nBeleg dieser Hypothese ist allerdings noch eine Erh\u00f6hung der aktuellen Fallzahl \nnotwendig. 95Strukturelle Ver\u00e4nderungen bei Patienten mit Phobischem Schwankschwindel - \neine Voxel basierte Morphometrie-Studie\nWurthmann S, N\u00e4gel S, Schulte Steinberg B, Theysohn N, Holle D, Diener HC, \nObermann M\nNeurologische Klinik, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Essen, Essen, Deutschland\nEinleitung: Der phobische Schwankschwindel (phobic postural vertigo, PPV) ist \nein sekund\u00e4r somatoformer Schwindel mit einer bislang weitgehend ungekl\u00e4rten \nPathophysiologie. Der PPV ist in der Altersgruppe der 20- bis 50-J\u00e4hrigen \ndie h\u00e4ufigste Schwindelform, die Geschlechtsverteilung ist ausgeglichen \n(m:w 1:1,04). Klinisch ist der PPV charakterisiert durch konfluierenden \nSchwankschwindel mit subjektiver Stand- und Gangunsicherheit, attackenartiger \nFallangst zumeist ohne St\u00fcrze und einer Verst\u00e4rkung der Symptome in typischen \nausl\u00f6senden Situationen (gro\u00dfe Menschenmengen, Superm\u00e4rkte, enge \nR\u00e4ume), was h\u00e4ufig zu Vermeidungsverhalten f\u00fchrt. Der PPV folgt h\u00e4ufig einer \norganischen Schwindelerkrankung. Ziel dieser Studie ist es herauszufinden, \nob es hirnstrukturelle Ver\u00e4nderungen bei Patienten mit PPV gibt und ob \ndiese im Zusammenhang mit der Schwere der klinischen Symptome oder der \nvorausgegangenen Schwindelerkrankung  stehen. \nMethode: Von jeweils  zwanzig Patienten mit PPV und gesunden \nKontrollprobanden (KP) ohne Vorerkrankungen (je elf M\u00e4nner und neun Frauen) \nwurden in einem 1,5-Tesla Magnetresonanztomographen dreidimensionale T1-\ngewichtete MPRAGEs (magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo) \nerstellt. Diese wurden mittels Voxel basierte Morphometrie (VBM) ausgewertet. \nF\u00fcr die Vorverarbeitung und die statistischen Analysen wurde SPM8 (statistical \nparametric mapping, FIL, UCL, London, UK) genutzt.\nErgebnisse: Sowohl in der Patienten- als auch in der Kontrollgruppe lag das \nDurchschnittsalter bei 36 Jahren (Spanne zwischen 24. bis 48.

Bei \n65 % der Patienten lie\u00df sich keine vorangegangene Schwindelerkrankung mit \norganischer Ursache finden, 20 % der Patienten litten zuvor an einer vestibul\u00e4ren \nMigr\u00e4ne. Ein Drittel der Patienten beklagten t\u00e4glichen Schwindel, die restlichen \nzwei Drittel beklagten mehrfach in der Woche respektive im Monat Schwindel. \nIn der PPV Gruppe zeigte sich im Vergleich zu den KPs einer Abnahme der \ngrauen Substanz im posterioren anterioren cingul\u00e4ren Cortex (pACC) sowie im \ndorsolateralem pr\u00e4frontalen Cortex (DLPC). Eine Zunahme an grauer Substanz \nkonnte nicht beobachtet werden.\nSchlussfolgerung: Patienten mit PPV zeigen im Vergleich zu Normalprobanden \neine Reduktion der grauen Substanz im pACC und im DLPC. In zahlreichen \nvorangegangenen Studien mit Patienten mit chronischen Schmerzen konnte \neine Abnahme der grauen Substanz in diesen Arealen beschrieben werden. \nWahrscheinlich ist dies Ausdruck einer geteilten Pathophysiologie, da auch beim \nPPV eine Ver\u00e4nderung der allgemein-sensorischen Verarbeitung denkbar ist. \nZudem ist der cingul\u00e4re Cortex Teil des limbischen Systems und somit Teil der 96emotionalen Bewertung. Die enge Verkn\u00fcpfung mit dem ebenfalls ver\u00e4nderten \nPr\u00e4frontalkortex k\u00f6nnte den Link zwischen dem Schwindel des PPV und dem \ntypischerweise damit einhergehenden Vermeidungsverhalten darstellen.97Imaging Pain in ultra-high-field. A 7T fMRI study.\nS.Naegel1, D.Holle1, S. Maderwald2, Z. Katsarava1, H.C. Diener1,  M.E. Ladd2,  \nM.Obermann1\n1. Dept. for Neurology University Duisburg-Essen 2. Erwin L. Hahn Institute for \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\nBackground:  Pain and Headache disorders like Tension-Type-Headache, Migraine \nare high frequent and partly very disabling conditions. Thereby they are causing \nserious individual and socioeconomic burden. Up to now various functional and \nstructural imaging studies gave major input to the understanding of pain especially \nin regard to general central processing, limbic involvement and chronification. But \nstill a significant amount of the pathophysiology of pain is poorly understood. \nOn the other hand ultra high filed MRI and its high signal noise ratio (SNR) is a \npowerful tool to perform functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and \nthereby study the human brain in a functional manner. The aim of our study was \nto establish a protocol to analyse human pain processing across the whole brain \nin ultra-high-field fMRI. \nMethods:  We therefore investigated pain processing in 6 healthy subjects (right \nhanded, Age 24-36Y) using a block design based on a multi-echo echo planar \nimaging sequence (TE1(ms): 10, TE2 (ms): 23.33, TE3 (ms): 36.66, TE4(ms): 49.99; \nTR(ms): 3000; Flip angle: 76) in a 7T Siemens MRI test unit based at Erwin L. \nHahn Institute for Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Essen. After various security \ntests and simulations pain was elicited to subject\u2019s right hand and foot (pseudo-\nrandomized) by a concentric platinum-copper electrode without significant \nferromagnetic properties. The pain specificity of this electrode was demonstrated \nin multiple previous electrophysiological trials. As control condition we used a \ncheckerboard (CB) with frequent black-white swapping for visual stimulation. \nfMRI Analysis was done using SPM8 and Matlab  7.6.0 (R2008a). \nResults:   In the control condition (visual stimulation by CB) we found massive \nactivation of the primary and secondary visual cortex even after correction for \nmultiple comparisons and highering the standard threshold to pFWE<0,005 in all \nsubjects. In painful stimulation all subjects showed activations in major parts of \nthe pain/attention network. In most patients these activations were consistently \nin primary and secondary somatosensory cortex as well as in the insular cortex, \nthe anterior cingulated cortex and the thalamus. Some of the patients showed \nadditional brainstem-activation. All activations described were robust and \nsurvived correction for multiple comparisons (pFWE<0,05). In comparison to \n1,5T piloting studies the activations seen in 7T-fMRI appeared to have a higher \nsignificance.\nDiscussion:  In this pilot study we were able to establish a protocol to study pain \nprocessing in ultra-high-field fMRI. In this protocol pain specificity was guaranteed \nby the use of a validated pain electing electrode. Activations in pain and in visual \nstimulation were consistent with neuroanatomical knowledge and previous 98structural and functional imaging studies. In total the activations observed in \n7T appeared be of a higher significance compared to those seen in lower field \nstrength fMRI using a comparable protocol.  Ultra high field pain related fMRI \nmight be able to hunt up smaller activations than standard high-field fMRI and \nthereby give important input to the deciphering of the complex human pain \nprocessing.99Lack of association of a fatty acit amide hydrolase (FAAH)  gene variant to weight \nloss in a one-year intervention for obese children and adolescents (Obeldicks)\nNadja Knoll1, Christiane Yigit1, Sebastian Beck1, Anna-Lena Volckmar1, \nAndr\u00e9 Scherag2, Carolin P\u00fctter2, Michaela Kleber3, Johannes Hebebrand1, \nAnke Hinney1*, Thomas Reinehr3*\n1Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Duisburg-Essen, \nEssen, Germany\n2Institute for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University of \nDuisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany \n3Vestische Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Witten/Herdecke, \nDatteln, Germany\n*equally contributed\nIntroduction:  Recently, it was shown that obese carriers of the A allele of SNP \nrs324420 in FAAH  lost more weight and improved associated phenotypes better \nthan non-carriers during an intervention. We tried to replicate this finding in \nobese children and adolescents undergoing a one year lifestyle intervention \n(Obeldicks program).\nSubjects and methods:  453 overweight and obese children and adolescents (10.8 \n\u00b1 2.6 years, BMI-SDS 2.4 \u00b1 0.5; 55% girls) were genotyped for rs324420 (C/A) by \nrestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Participants received a \nbalanced diet, containing 55 En% carbohydrates, 30 En% fat and 15 En% proteins. \nMoreover, they took part in an exercise therapy once a week. Blood was taken \nat baseline and after one year of intervention. Anthropometric (height, weight, \nBMI and BMI-SDS) and plasma parameters (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, \nHDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerides, glucose, insulin and HOMA) as well as blood \npressure were measured.\nResults:  Both BMI and BMI-SDS improved significantly among all subjects. The \nmean systolic blood pressure was also lowered and concentrations of HDL-\ncholesterol increased significantly. However, none of the measured parameters \nwere associated with FAAH  rs324420 genotypes.\nConclusion:  We did not detect association of FAAH  genotypes with weight \nreduction in overweight and obese children and adolescents. Hence, the previous \nfinding in adults could not be confirmed. As the length (1 year vs. 3 months) \nand the set up (hypo caloric diet in adults versus physical activity plus balanced \nmeals) of the interventions differed, these parameters might have influenced the \ndifferent results. \nFunding: NGFNplus01GS0820, BMBF 01KU0903100Gene-correction in induced pluripotent stem cell derived neural stem cells using \nAAV-mediated targeting\nDaniel Poppe, Peter Breuer, Jonas Doerr, Johannes Jungverdorben, Michael Peitz, \nOliver Br\u00fcstle* and Philipp Koch*\nInstitute of Reconstructive Neurobiology, LIFE&BRAIN Center, University of Bonn \nand Hertie Foundation, Bonn, Germany (* corresponding authors)\nBackground:  Induced pluripotent stem cells provide a fascinating tool to study \ndisease-associated changes directly in the cell type affected in vivo. In such \nstudies, iPS cells derived from healthy donors are typically used as reference \npoint. However, considering the genetic variability between human individuals, \nan ideal control for studying monogenic diseases would be gene-corrected \niPS cells from the same patient. So far, classic methods of targeted genetic \nmodification have proven inefficient in human pluripotent stem cells. Here we \npresent the efficient gene correction of an expanded polyglutamin-containing \nallele in human neural stem cells (lt-NES cells; Koch et al., PNAS 106(9):3225-30, \n2009) generated from iPSC derived from a patient with Machado Joseph Disease \n(MJD). In MJD, the monoallelic expansion of a polyglutamin-encoding CAG motif \nin exon 10 is causative for the formation of ATXN3-containing aggregates and \nneurodegeneration.\nMethods:  To exchange the mutation-containing exon we took advantage of \nthe ability of recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors to efficiently target \nhomologous chromosomal loci and introduce defined sequences with high \nfidelity. Using exon-flanking homology arms the expanded exon was exchanged \nby the non-expanded exon amplified from the healthy allele from the same \npatient.\nResults:  From a single viral transduction of 750.000 cells, an average of 220\u00b140 \nclonal neural stem cell lines could be generated. Out of 60 clones analyzed by \nPCR and 22 clones analyzed by Western Blotting, all showed reversion to a non-\nexpanded CAG-containing allele. \nDiscussion: Our data suggest that AAV-mediated gene correction could represent \na fast and efficient approach to generate isogenic controls in iPSC-based disease \nmodeling.  \nFunding:  Hertie Foundation101Genotype-phenotype correlation in caveolinopathy: Pathogenicity of the \nsequence variant G55S \nEva Brauers, Institut f\u00fcr Neuropathologie, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Aachen\nAndreas Roos, Institut f\u00fcr Neuropathologie, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Aachen\nAlf Beckmann, Medizinisches Versorgungszentrum Dr. Eberhard und Partner \nDortmund ; \nMartin H\u00e4usler, Klinik f\u00fcr Kinder- und Jugendmedizin, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Aachen ;\nHartmut Bauer, Neurologische Klinik, Marien-Hospital, Euskirchen ;\nJoachim Weis, Institut f\u00fcr Neuropathologie, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Aachen\nCaveolins are structural and functional proteins located in flask-shaped plasma \nmembrane invaginations called caveolae. They have been involved in the \nsignalling and trafficking of growth factor receptors / receptor tyrosine kinases \nlike EGFR. Mutations in Caveolin-3, which is mainly expressed in muscle cells, \ncause autosomal dominant myopathies of different severity ranging from \nasymptomatic hyperCKemia to lethal LGMD-1C and cardiomyopathy. In this \nstudy, we examined muscle biopsies from two index patients of two unrelated \nfamilies with hereditary myopathy harbouring the G55S caveolin-3 amino \nacid change. This sequence variant has been described previously to be either \nasymptomatic or to cause mild myopathy. In the present families, this sequence \nvariant segregated with moderate to severe myopathy. Histology revealed \nmoderate chronic myopathic changes and reduced sarcolemmal Caveolin-3 \nimmunoreactivity in both cases examined. Caveolin-3 levels were also reduced \nin immunoblots. Electron microscopy revealed moderately enlarged caveolae in \none case. Interestingly, in the other case, a vacuolar myopathy with prominent \nmyonuclear degeneration was found. In RCMH cells transfected with G55S \ncaveolin-3, pathological Caveolin-3 deposits were found to be associated with \nthe Golgi apparatus, but considerable Caveolin-3 levels were still present at the \nsarcolemma. Phosphoblotting demonstrated that G55S affects the signalling \nof EGFR. Interestingly, besides the amino acid change the index patients as well \nas their family members present different SNPs in the caveolin-3  gene. Our \nresults indicate that the sequence variant G55S is pathogenic and alters the \nsignalling of EGFR. On a more general note, these results further elucidate the \npathomechanisms of caveolinopathies. Finally, they illustrate the value of muscle \nbiopsy analysis for the diagnosis of hereditary myopathies in cases of ambiguous \nmolecular genetic data.102Discriminating bodily expressions of emotions: an fMRI study\nDenise Prochnow*, Bernhard H\u00f6ing, Ralf Sch\u00e4fer, Hans-J\u00f6rg Wittsack, \nRobert Lindenberg, Matthias Franz, R\u00fcdiger J. Seitz\n*Department of Neurology, Clinical Institute of Psychomsomatic Medicine, Institute \nof Radiology, University Hospital D\u00fcsseldorf, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\nBackground:  The communication of emotional states is fundamental for social \nlife. Whenever spoken language is not sufficient, people engage in bodily \nactions including facial expressions or gestures to convey information about \ntheir emotional state to others. The addressee has to evaluate the intention of \nthe addresser and to categorize the emotional face expressions and gestures as \npositive or friendly versus negative or aversive in order to react appropriately. In \nthis functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we wished to explore \nthe brain areas underlying the discrimination of bodily expressions of emotions.\nMethods:  Sixteen non-alexithymic healthy subjects (22+/-2ys) were presented \nwith video-clips that showed the evolution of emotional face expressions \nor emblematic gestures evolving from a neutral starting point to their full \nmeaningful expressions. The subjects were instructed to discriminate in a forced-\nalternative choice paradigm an angry facial expression from other emotional face \nexpressions and a negative from a positive gesture, respectively, and to convey \ntheir decisions by a button press. FMRI scanning was performed on a 3 T Siemens \nMRI with 44 transversal slices oriented parallel to the bi-commissural plane. \nImage data were analyzed using a random effects analysis followed by a region of \ninterest analysis of the brain activation beta-indices.\nResults:  There was a main effect related to the perception of face expressions \nand gestures in the right inferior temporal gyrus. The inferior temporal gyrus \nwas also active at the time point of discrimination. The right inferior frontal \ngyrus was active during the perception of the face expressions but became more \nactive at the time point when the subjects made the discrimination. The dorsal \nmedial frontal cortex was activated in relation to perception of the emotional \nface expressions but was deactivated at the time point of discrimination. The \ndorsal medial frontal cortex and the right inferior frontal gyrus correlated with \nthe subjective valence of the emblematic gestures during perception. There was \nan activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex which occurred only in \nrelation to the discrimination and correlated with the inferior temporal, inferior \nfrontal and dorsal medial frontal activations.\nDiscussion: The activation of the inferior temporal gyrus is likely to reflect the \nformal visual analysis of the emotional face expressions and emblematic gestures. \nDiscrimination involved frontal brain areas related valuating of emotions. We \nsuggest that the brain structures identified here for appraisal and discrimination \nof affective body expressions are key structures mediating social interactions. 103Sind Menschen in der Lage, die Emotion Angst mithilfe chemosensorisch \nwirksamer Signale zu kommunizieren?\nFreiherr J1, Haegler K2, Zernecke R2, Kleemann AM2, Schmithausen J1, Pollatos O3, \nWiesmann M1\n1 Klinik f\u00fcr Diagnostische und Interventionelle Neuroradiologie, RWTH Aachen\n2 Abteilung f\u00fcr Neuroradiologie, LMU M\u00fcnchen\n3 Department Psychologie, Universit\u00e4t Potsdam\nEINLEITUNG:  Aus dem Tierreich ist bekannt, dass im Angstzustand geruchsaktive \nSubstanzen mit dem Schwei\u00df abgegeben werden, welche als spezifische Signale \ninnerhalb einer Spezies wirken.

However, inflammatory stimulation \n(IS) enables RGCs to survive axotomy and regenerate axons in the injured optic \nnerve. Similar effects are achieved by the genetic deletion of phosphatase and \ntensin homolog (PTEN) and subsequent mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) \nactivation.\nMethods:  We used the optic nerve crush model to functional assess the role of mTOR \nin axon regeneration as well as Western-blot analysis and immunohistochemical \nmethods. \nResults:  Here, we report that IS prevents the axotomy-induced decrease of \nmTOR activity in RGCs in a CNTF/LIF-dependent manner. Inactivation of mTOR \nsignificantly reduced the number of long axons regenerating in the optic nerve, \nbut surprisingly, did not affected the initial switch of RGCs into the regenerative \nstate, or the neuroprotective effects associated with IS. In vitro, inhibition of mTOR \nactivity reduced regeneration on myelin or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans \n(CSPGs), but not on a growth-permissive substrate. \nConclusion:  Thus, mTOR activity is not generally required for neuroprotection or \nswitching mature neurons into an active regenerative state, but it is important for \nthe maintenance of the axonal growth state and overcoming of inhibitory effects \ncaused by myelin and CSPGs.105ERYTHROPOIETIN AMELIORATES EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE NEURITIS\nAnne K Mausberg1, Thomas Dehmel1, Mark Stettner1, Kazim A Sheikh2, \nBernd C Kieseier1\nDepartment of Neurology1, Heinrich-Heine-University D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\nDepartment of Neurology2, University of Texas Medical School at Houston, \nHouston, TX, USA\nBackground:  Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a disabling autoimmune disorder of \nthe peripheral nervous system associated with relevant morbidity and mortality; \nthus, novel treatment options are warranted. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a pleiotropic \ncytokine originally identified for its role in erythropoiesis. However, in various \npreclinical models EPO exhibited protective activity against tissue injury.\nMethods:  To test the therapeutic potential in experimental autoimmune neuritis \n(EAN) - an animal model of human GBS - EPO was tested in a prevention and a \ntreatment paradigm. \nEAN was induced in female Lewis rats by immunization with bovine peripheral \nmyelin. Animals were treated with EPO prior to or with onset of first clinical signs of \ndisease activity. Assessment included clinical scoring, the degree of inflammation \nwithin the peripheral nerve as monitored by immunohistochemistry and the \nstatus of myelination in semi-thin sections. \nResults: While the treatment in the prevention paradigm ameliorated clinical \ndisease activity during all phases of the disease, the therapeutic administration \nof EPO improved clinical remission. Immunohistochemistry of sciatic nerves \nrevealed no significant alteration of T cell numbers under treatment. Surprisingly, \nthe number of macrophages was significantly increased in the two treatment \ngroups at peak of disease and also during the recovery phase. The massive \nnumber of macrophages seen within the peripheral nerve correlated with the \nstaining for TGF-beta. Significantly more TGF-beta positive cells were detectable \nin the two treated groups at the peak of the disease and - to a lesser extend - \nalso during the remission phase. Epon sections at day 29 post immunization \nrevealed more demyelination without remyelination and axonal degeneration in \nthe control nerves compared to nerves of animals treated with EPO. In vitro  EPO \nreduced antigen-dependent proliferation of T cells in a dose dependent manner \nand also significantly reduced allogenic T cell activation. Cultivation of peritoneal \nmacrophages or T cells in the presence of EPO had no impact on the secretion \nof the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-gamma, but increased the amount of anti-\ninflammatory TGF-beta, as investigated by ELISA. \nDiscussion:  Our data suggest that EPO ameliorates immune-mediated damage to \nperipheral nerve by the induction of beneficial macrophages within the peripheral \nnerve. Further studies are warranted to elaborate the clinical usefulness of EPO \nfor treating immune-mediated neuropathies in affected patients.106Quinpramine \u2013 a potential new immunosuppressive compound \u2013 ameliorates rat \nexperimental autoimmune neuritis and  redistributes MHC class II molecules.\nGerd Meyer zu Horste1, Anne Mausberg1, Hans-Peter Hartung1, Olaf Stuve2, \nCarsten Korth3, Bernd C. Kieseier1\nUniversity of D\u00fcsseldorf, 1Department of Neurology, 3Department of Neuropathology\n2University of Texas Southwestern, Department of Neurology, Dallas, USA \nIntroduction: Acridine-iminodibenzyl chimeric compounds are a novel class \nof cholesterol-redistributing substances with antiprion and possibly also anti-\ninflammatory effects. In previous studies the lead compound quinpramine \neffectively suppressed manifestation of symptoms in an animal model of human \nmultiple sclerosis. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a disabling autoimmune \ndisorder of the peripheral nervous system associated with relevant morbidity \nand mortality and experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) serves as its animal \nmodel . Aim:   To test the therapeutic potential and mechanism of action of \nquinpramine in EAN.\nMethods: EAN was induced in female Lewis rats by immunization with bovine \nperipheral myelin. Animals were treated with quinpramine prior to or with onset \nof first clinical signs of disease activity. Assessment included clinical scoring, the \ndegree of inflammation as monitored by immunohistochemistry, and the status of \nmyelination in semi-thin sections. Immune activation was determined by antigen-\nspecific T cell proliferation and by FACS analysis of MHC class II expression ex vivo  \nund in vitro . To determine the target cell of quinpramine, antigen presenting \ncells (APCs) and T cells were both pretreated in vitro  and antigen-specific T cell \nproliferation was measured.\nResults:  Quinpramine reduced the clinical and histological severity of EAN. \nBoth, preventive and treatment regimens significantly improved the clinical \nscore, although disease prevention exerted a more pronounced clinical effect. \nIn line with the ameliorated disease severity in treated animals myelin was \nwell maintained and less immune cell infiltration was detectable. Splenocytes \nfrom quinpramine treated animals displayed significantly reduced antigen \nspecific proliferation. Again, the effect was more prominent in animals treated \npreventively. Pretreatment of APCs significantly decreased T cell proliferation, \nwhile T cell preincubation with quinpramine did not alter the proliferating capacity. \nPrevious studies had shown the redistribution of cholesterol into intracellular \ncompartments. We therefore also analyzed MHC class II distribution and showed \na reduction in MHC class II surface expression on quinpramine treated cells.\nConclusion: Quinpramine reduces clinically and histologically the severity of EAN. \nMHC class II expression and antigen-specific T cell proliferation were reduced \nboth in vitro  and in vivo,  based on an effect on APCs rather than on T cells. Thus, \nwe hypothesize that by redistributing cholesterol rich membrane domains to \nintracellular compartments quinpramine reduces cell surface availability of MHC \nclass II and therefore inhibits autoimmune (re-) activation. The anti-inflammatory \ncompound quinpramine may constitute a novel therapeutic option in human GBS.107Taxol facilitates axon regeneration in the mature CNS\nVetrivel Sengottuvel, Marco Leibinger, Anastasia Andreadaki and Dietmar Fischer\nExperimental Neurology, University Clinic of D\u00fcsseldorf\nIntroduction: Mature retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) cannot normally regenerate \naxons into the injured optic nerve, but can do so after lens injury. However, the \noutcome of this regeneration is still limited by inhibitors associated with the CNS \nmyelin and the glial scar. \nMethods: We used the optic nerve crush model to functional assess the effects \nof locally applied Taxol on promoting axon regeneration as well as Western-blot \nanalysis and immunohistochemical methods. \nResults: The current study demonstrates that Taxol markedly enhanced neurite \nextension of mature RGCs and PC12 cells by stabilization of microtubules and \ndesensitized axons towards myelin and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan  (CSPG) \ninhibition  in vitro without reducing RhoA activation. In vivo  the local application \nof Taxol at the injury site of the optic nerve of rats enabled axons to regenerate \nbeyond the lesion site, but did not affect the intrinsic regenerative state of RGCs. \nFurthermore, Taxol treatment markedly increased lens injury  mediated  axon \nregeneration in vivo , delayed glial scar formation, suppressed CSPG expression, \nand transiently reduced the infiltration of macrophages at the injury site. \nConclusion: Thus, microtubules stabilizing compounds such as Taxol might \nbe promising candidates as adjuvant drugs in the treatment of CNS injuries \nparticularly when combined with interventions stimulating the intrinsic \nregenerative state of neurons.108Zebrafish crypt neurons express a single V1R-like olfactory receptor gene\nYuichiro Oka & Sigrun I. Korsching\nInstitut f\u00fcr Genetik, Universit\u00e4t zu K\u00f6ln\nIntroduction:  Crypt neurons constitute the third type of olfactory sensory \nneurons. Unlike the extensively studied ciliated and microvillous neurons, very \nlittle is known about them, not even the olfactory receptor family they express. \nWe recently identified a novel olfactory receptor family of six highly conserved G \nprotein-coupled receptors, the v1r-like ora genes. \nResults:  We report here that a single member of this family, ora4 , is expressed in \nnearly all crypt neurons, defined by S100 immunoreactivity, in zebrafish. None \nof the other five ora genes are found in this neuronal population. Accordingly, no \nco-expression of ora4 with any of the remaining five ora genes was observed with \ndouble in situ hybridization, consistent with the monogenic pattern of expression \ncharacteristic of olfactory receptor genes. Furthermore, several lines of evidence \nsuggest the absence of any other olfactory receptors such as ORs, TAARs and the \nV2R-like OlfCs in crypt neurons. \nDiscussion:  These results suggest that the entire crypt neuron population selects \none and the same olfactory receptor gene for expression. This coding strategy is \nradically different from the expression of large olfactory receptor gene families \nin both ciliated and microvillous neuron populations. Thus, we have identified \na more restricted mode of expression than the well-known \u2018one neuron \u2013 one \nreceptor\u2019 rule. This \u2018one cell type \u2013 one receptor\u2019 mode is familiar in the visual \nsystem, with rhodopsin as the sole light receptor of rod photoreceptor cells, but \nup to now not suspected to occur in the olfactory system. Identification of the \nreceptor expressed provides the molecular starting-point necessary to unravel \ncrypt neuron signaling and function.109Fingolimod impedes Schwann cell mediated myelination\nAngelika K\u00f6hne, MD, Mark Stettner, MD,  Parastoo Jangouk, MD,  \nThomas Dehmel, PhD,  Hans-Peter Hartung, MD,  Helmar C. Lehmann, MD,  and \nBernd C. Kieseier, MD\nDepartment of Neurology, Clinical and Experimental Neuroimmunology, Heinrich-\nHeine-University, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\nIntroduction:   Fingolimod (FTY720), a sphingosin-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor \nagonist, is a recently approved drug for treating multiple sclerosis.  Experimental \nevidence suggests that FTY720 not only exhibits anti-inflammatory properties \nbut also promotes myelination in the central nervous system by direct interaction \nwith oligodendrocytes.  Aim of this study was to assess the effects of FTY720 on \nSchwann cells (SCs) and peripheral nerve myelination.\nMethods:   Receptor expression studies and myelination were investigated \nin primary rat SCs and rat neuronal/SC co-cultures.  Cells were treated with \nphysiologically relevant concentrations of the active phosphorylated form of \nFTY720 (FTY720P).  In addition, S1P receptor  expression was corroborated in \nhuman and rat peripheral nerve tissue sections.\nResults:   SCs express all known S1P receptors in vitro  and in vivo . FTY720P did \nnot impede receptor expression levels.  In the myelination model treatment with \nFTY720P resulted in a significant reduction of quantitative myelin formation.  \nFTY720P induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SCs leading to apoptosis of \nthese cells, as demonstrated by the detection of caspse-3 and -7, as well as TUNEL \nlabeling. This effect was dependent of S1PR signaling, since blocking of S1PRs \nameliorated ROS production and SC apoptosis.\nConclusion:   FTY720P induces ROS mediated apoptosis in SCs and may interfere \nwith peripheral nerve myelination. 110SCHWANN CELL MIGRATION IN INFLAMMATORY MILIEUS\nMark Stettner, Sandra Labus, Anne K. Mausberg, Thomas Dehmel, Angelika K\u00f6hne \nand Bernd C. Kieseier\nDepartment of Neurology, Research Group for Clinical and Experimental \nNeuroimmunology, Heinrich-Heine-University, D\u00fcsseldorf, German\nBackground : While polyneuropathies (PNP) are known as common causes of \ndisability, the underlying molecular mechanisms of degrading and remodelling \nperipheral myelin are not completely clear. Schwann cells (SCs) as glial cells of \nthe peripheral nervous system (PNS) play a main role in myelin restructuring, a \nprocess requiring the ability of SCs to migrate, in damaged peripheral nerves, e.g., \nin the context of immune-mediated damage to the PNS.\nMethods: The present study was designed to identify cytokines secreted by \ninflammatory cells as mediators of SC locomotion. The correlation between \nactivity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), relevant endopeptidases for \ncell migration, and SCmobility were studied. Furthermore, serum from rats \ninduced with experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) at different stages of \nthe disease, interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interferon gamma (IFN- \u03b3 ) as key cytokines \nof an inflammatory TH1/TH2 response, as well as toll-like receptor 4 ligand \nlipopolysaccharides (LPS), were analysed as attractants and modulators of \nmigration. To address these subjects, we purified SCs from sciatic nerves of \nneonatal rats in order to record SC migration, using systems for directed as well as \nfor undirected migration. We applied transwells and chemotaxismigration-slides \nto analyse directed horizontal and vertical migration, and stamp plates as well as \nscratch assays in order to record undirected migration. Long-term imaging was \nperformed in a conditioned microscope chamber up to three days.\nResults: We observed an increase of undirected SC mobility after treatment with \nLPS, and after inhibition of MMP with an nonspecific MMP inhibitor this elevation \nwas diminished. Stimulation with EAN serum had a distinct influence on directed \nmigration, and the pure stimulation with IL-4 and IFN- \u03b3 confirmed these findings.\nDiscussion: We conclude that an unspecific inflammatory stimulus increases \nthe unspecific movement of SCs, to some extent caused via MMP secretion. In \nrespect to chemotaxis, a specific pattern of cytokines during inflammation and \nregeneration is crucial to conduct and regulate SC locomotion. This study provides \nnew insights into restorative mechanisms of the PNS which may be useful in the \ndevelopment of target therapies.111112Alphabetisches Verzeichnis der Poster\nName Vorname Seite \n Albayrak \u00d6zg\u00fcr 64\n Bendix Ivo 34\n Bista Pawan 67\n Breucker Laura 6\n Brauers Eva 101\n Buchkremer Stephan 92\n Cerina Manuela 63\n Dalis Marcella 39\n Dalecki Marc 33\n Damen Daniela 74\n Dlugaj Martha 25\n Dovern Anna 8\n Dr\u00fcke Barbara 83\n Eden Annuschka 47\n El Ali Ayman 72\n F\u00f6cker Manuel 18,19\n Freiherr Jessica 103\n Friedmann Christine 21\n Gazea Mary 75\n Gerding Wanda 43\n Gerardo-Nava Jose Luis 81\n Gronewold Janine 40\n Grotegerd Dominik 77\n Hasan Mohammad Rakibul 59\n Heber Anke 89\n Herz Josephine 42\n Herring Arne 13\n Hoffstaedter Felix 52\n Holle Dagny 90\n Jantzen Sabine 88\n Johst S\u00f6ren 54\n Keuters Meike 38\n Kotsis Vassilios 30\n K\u00f6hne Angelika 109\n Kobza Stefan 62\n K\u00fchn Anne 32\n Kullmann Jennifer 12\n Krasny Andrej 51\n Lange Maren 85\n Lech Robert 66\n Leibinger Marco 104\n L\u00fcnskens Raphaela 86\n Mainz Verena 58\n Mausberg Anne- Kathrin 105\n Mayorenko Ivanna 80\n Meyer zu H\u00f6rste Gerd 106113Name Vorname Seite \n M\u00f6nninghoff Christoph 24\n Moos Katharina 15\n N\u00e4gel Steffen 94\n Novkovic Tanja 27\n Oka Yuichiro 108\n Pabst Stephan 69\n Passlick Stefan 68\n Plewan Thorsten 46\n Pohl Anna 84\n Poppe Daniel 100\n Prager Sebastian 34\n Prochnow Denise 102\n Reick Christiane 79\n Roy Lucia 11\n Roll Lars 16\n Roos Andreas 91\n Rustemeier Martina 14\n R\u00fcther Naima 82\n Schulte-Steinberg Benedict 94\n Schlager Gerald 35\n Seidel Ulla 56\n Sengottuvel Vetrivel 107\n Syed Adnan 23\n Stettner Mark 110\n Timmer Marco 70\n Th\u00fcrling Markus 20\n Umutlu Lale 78\n von Polier Georg 93\n Wefers Annika Kristina 60\n Wirth Timo 57\n W\u00fcnnemann Meret 49\n Wiemers Uta 28\n Wiescholleck Valentina 10\n Wurthmann Sebastian 95\n Yigit Christiane 99\n Zaremba Sebastian 45\n Zechariah Anil 73114Die Ausrichtung der Tagung NeuroVisionen 7 wurde durch die Unterst\u00fctzung \nfolgender Sponsoren erm\u00f6glicht: \nKliniken / Institute der Universit\u00e4t Duisburg - Essen:\nErwin L.
