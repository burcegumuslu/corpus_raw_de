A recently published report describes the case of a 73-year-old man with no history of epilepsy, who would regularly become rigid and pass out when laughing hard after meals. After a detailed history and a careful diagnostic examination, he was finally diagnosed with laughter-induced syncope, a rare\n[syndrome] that is considered to have a good prognosis. If you happen to stumble over Santa unconscious with milk and cookies on his beard this Christmas morning, now you know what to consider as differential diagnosis! [1]\nDo not attempt while under the effects of alcohol \u2013 As many of you may already know (from patient\u2019s stories, of course), cognition and behavior tend to change because of alcohol consumption, but whether these effects persist when the hangover hits is still a matter of investigation. Researchers assessed the effect of alcohol intoxication and hangovers on the learning capabilities of some very altruistic volunteers, willing to get drunk in the name of science. Hangover was defined as a mixture of negative physical and mental symptoms that occur after consumption of alcohol, and start when the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) approaches zero. Initially, 76 healthy men were included. However, 6 participants were excluded for various reasons, including 3 individuals in the acute intoxication group becoming too intoxicated to continue. While the participants in the intoxication group (n=34) demonstrated elimination of learning while intoxicated, those in the hangover group (n=36) showed no learning impairments. Now you know: even though your head may be pounding from the holiday celebrations, science says it's still working fine!

However, data establishing associations between public mental health and infection rates is not easy to come by. [16]\nIn this study, researchers analyzed 8 million helpline calls from 14 European countries, the USA, China, Hong Kong, Israel, and Lebanon between 2019 and early 2021.\nSix weeks after the initial outbreak, the call volume reached its peak at + 35% compared to prepandemic levels. Of all relevant mental health concerns, \u201cfear\u201d showed the highest increase at 2.4% (95% CI, 1.8 to 2.9), followed by \u201cloneliness\u201d at + 1.5% (95% CI, 1.1 to 1.8).

However, research has shown that the referral case-mix differs between male and female surgeons, influencing practice profitability and possibly contributing to the gender pay gap. How these differences arise is still a subject of research. [18]\nThis Canadian cross-sectional population-based study analyzed the distribution of referrals by gender, using data from over 40 million referrals made from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2016.\nMale surgeons accounted for 77.5% of all surgeons and received a disproportionately high number of referrals from both male (87.1%) and female physicians (79.3%). Male physicians were 32.0% more likely to refer patients to a male surgeon (95% CI, 31.8\u201332.2%), whereas female physicians were only 1.6% more likely to refer patients to a female surgeon (95% CI, 1.4\u20131.9%). Female patients accounted for a greater proportion of referrals to female surgeons compared to male surgeons (76.8% vs. 55.3%, P < 0.001). While the proportion of female surgeons increased during the study period, the pattern of referrals did not.\nLimitations include that the study was conducted in a single Canadian province, thus limiting generalizability.\nThe take\u2011home message?\nIn this Canadian study, male surgeons received absolutely and proportionally more patient referrals than female surgeons, corroborating the well-known pattern of disadvantage experienced by women in most areas of professional life. The fact that this pattern persisted even as the proportion of female surgeons increased, speaks to the system\u2019s resilience to change.\n- Title of study: Sex differences in the pattern of patient referrals to male and female surgeons [19]\n- Authors: Dossa F et al.\n- Journal: JAMA Surgery\nAre stronger\n[opioids](/de/wissen/Opioide#Z932f6ac6614fddfe1977e37d73b7d7ec) superior to mild [opioids](/de/wissen/Opioide#Z932f6ac6614fddfe1977e37d73b7d7ec) in treating subacute postoperative pain?\nOne-Minute Telegram 40-2021-3/3 - The practice of prescribing analgesics has come under increasing scrutiny with growing\n[awareness] of the [opioid](/de/wissen/Opioide#Z932f6ac6614fddfe1977e37d73b7d7ec) crisis. While studies support the use of strong [opioids](/de/wissen/Opioide#Z932f6ac6614fddfe1977e37d73b7d7ec) in chronic cancer pain, evidence for their superior effectiveness over mild [opioids](/de/wissen/Opioide#Z932f6ac6614fddfe1977e37d73b7d7ec) in noncancer pain is largely lacking. [20][21]\nThis double-blind clinical trial randomized 120 patients with a fracture requiring surgery to receive either oxycodone hydrochloride (a strong\n[opioid](/de/wissen/Opioide#Z932f6ac6614fddfe1977e37d73b7d7ec)) or a combination of codeine (a mild [opioid](/de/wissen/Opioide#Z932f6ac6614fddfe1977e37d73b7d7ec)) and acetaminophen.\nDuring the first seven days after discharge from hospital, the mean daily\n[opioid](/de/wissen/Opioide#Z932f6ac6614fddfe1977e37d73b7d7ec) dose (morphine equivalent) was 32.9 mg in the strong- [opioid](/de/wissen/Opioide#Z932f6ac6614fddfe1977e37d73b7d7ec) group and 5.5 mg in the mild- [opioid](/de/wissen/Opioide#Z932f6ac6614fddfe1977e37d73b7d7ec) group. During this period, mean pain scores as measured by a numerical rating scale ( [NRS](/de/wissen/Schmerztherapie#Z02992dfa1aa1a4c75b8a01d53f7c4145)) did not differ significantly between the groups (intraclass correlation coefficient -0.50; 95% Cl, -1.11 to 0.12).

The use of race, considered a social rather than a [biological](/de/wissen/Immunsuppressiva#Zc4f8bb61c1be8bf782272d0e9b088995) category, has been criticized as a potential contributing factor to structural determinants of systemic racism in medicine. [23]\nResearchers used data from several existing datasets to develop new\n[eGFR] equations using age and sex (AS) but not race and compared their accuracy to that of conventional [eGFR] equations (ASR) in a validation dataset of 12 studies (n = 4050 participants; 14.3% black participants).

The best measured [GFR](/de/wissen/Chronische_Nierenerkrankung#Z9b64c222c41232ab914b726d36f985de) approximation was obtained with a new AS equation incorporating both creatinine and cystatin, eGFRcr-cys(AS). Of all conventional and new equations, [CKD](/de/wissen/Chronische_Nierenerkrankung#Z82e04c31a8143498765bfb4bcb9af849) [staging](/de/wissen/Allgemeine_Onkologie#Z7d985843c1d2c64ebe80f2f1daf3e11b) agreement was highest for the new eGFRcr-cys(AS) equation in both black (68.4%) and non-black participants (70.2%).\nLimitations include that the studies used only involved outpatients without serious comorbidities.

Your sixth sense is tingling \u2026 or is it just the other five playing tricks? Experts in environmental psychology reviewed the literature in an attempt to explain the phenomenon of haunted houses, comparing data on air quality, temperature, infrasound, lighting levels, and electromagnetic fields. Unfortunately, the ghosts remained elusive and the data did not yield an answer as to why some houses are experienced as haunted. However, the researchers do offer a, self-admittedly, extreme reflection on the hypothesis that the universe is a simulation and that ghosts are just glitches in the matrix.

The question that naturally comes to mind in a situation like this is whether it\u2019s worth wasting the booze or will an empty bottle smash a skull just as well? Finally, researchers have set out to find the answer with an experimental study (no slashers were harmed in the course of this study, but beer was wasted). The researchers took six empty and four full 0.5 L bottles of beer and determined the amount of energy needed to break them. As it turns out, both make for great horror movie weapons, although breaking an empty bottle requires more energy (40 vs. 30 joules) and may, therefore, do more damage. So, there\u2019s a good argument for keeping the full bottles for the victory celebration. However, being heavier, full bottles require less effort to achieve a similar effect and may be the weapon of choice if your arms and legs have turned to jelly and you don\u2019t want to take any chances. But there\u2019s a catch: You only get one shot at knocking out the slasher and you\u2019ll have to make that one count, as the energy a bottle can transmit suffices only to fracture the weaker parts of the\n[neurocranium](/de/wissen/Sch\u00e4del#Z5819a4b336e1d087bbea6291acc0f93e) \u2026 and who wants a slasher to spring back up and continue slashing?

Rabbit fever, or tularemia, is a vector-borne disease predominantly transmitted by ticks and caused by the bacteria Francisella tularensis, for whom rabbits are a common reservoir host. A recent case report by Lukas Antonitsch and colleagues narrates the case of a 53-year-old man who presented with a 3-week history of fever, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, and significant weight loss unresponsive to supportive measures. [158] While the patient did not report attacks by ferocious rabbits or ravenous ticks, a more detailed investigation of his history revealed that he had been working in the woods over the past 6 weeks. Accordingly, a diagnosis was suspected and serological testing with\n[ELISA](/de/wissen/Biochemische_Labormethoden#Zaab232f44aa5d62b99a813df1147ea2e) confirmed the presence of [IgG](/de/wissen/Spezifisches_Immunsystem#Zcefedd803831e15fbb5c938286fcf55e) and [IgM](/de/wissen/Spezifisches_Immunsystem#Zba600a4ac4410a66a66a4dd7078fa09f) antibodies against F. tularensis. This case report highlights the importance of proper history taking when it comes to patients with [fever of unknown origin](/de/wissen/Fieber_und_Entz\u00fcndungsreaktionen#Z9bc4d6a4bd5c37b97394c1efb7e9d25c) \u2013 and of keeping rabbit fever in mind as a differential diagnosis, considering its very variable manifestations (e.g., ulceroglandular, [glandular], oculoglandular, pharyngeal, pulmonary, typhoid).\nAre your baskets ready? \u2013 Word around town is the Easter Bunny is already busy decorating eggs and we\u2019re all itching to go hunt them!

[159][160] But what about bunnies? Anna Z. Mykytyn and colleagues recently conducted an experimental study to determine the response of rabbits to inoculation with [SARS-CoV-2](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Za0abd91853146a79d53946ed3db633d3) and found that, while no rabbits developed symptoms, they were indeed susceptible to infection. [161] However, transmission between themselves and to other species is yet to be determined. In conclusion, we probably shouldn\u2019t be all too concerned about the Easter Bunny developing [COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7), nor do we believe the Easter Bunny poses much of a risk to humans, considering his shy and sneaky nature.

[167]\nUsing laboratory data from 3,257,478 US patients, this retrospective cohort study attempted to determine if previous exposure to\n[SARS-CoV-2](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Za0abd91853146a79d53946ed3db633d3) (defined as an initial positive antibody test) resulted in protection against future infection as confirmed by nucleic [acid](/de/wissen/S\u00e4ure-Basen-Haushalt#Zb05ef5c16afed1435f1625918811375f) amplification test (NAAT).

From day 0 to 30, initially seropositive patients were more likely to have positive NAAT results, probably due to continued viral shedding (ratio 2.85; 95% CI, 2.73\u20132.97). After 30 days of follow-up, however, patients who were initially seropositive became much less likely than initially seronegative patients to have positive NAAT for [SARS-CoV-2](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Za0abd91853146a79d53946ed3db633d3):\n- Day 31\u201360: ratio 0.67; 95% CI, 0.6\u20130.74\n- Day 61\u201390: ratio 0.29; 95% CI, 0.24\u20130.35\n- After day 90: ratio 0.10; 95% CI, 0.05\u20130.19\nLimitations include a lack of data regarding possible differences in viral exposure between the groups.

However, data regarding the comparative effectiveness of fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics in various infections is scarce. [169]\nThis retrospective study compared the outpatient treatment of diverticulitis with a combination of metronidazole and fluoroquinolone (n = 124,000) vs.\n[amoxicillin](/de/wissen/Antibiotika_-_\u00dcbersicht#Za6dad35eb36b5da0940872cd1193a503)-clavulanate (n = 15,869) in immunocompetent patients, measuring the risks for admission, urgent surgery, and [Clostridioides difficile](/de/wissen/Systematik_der_Bakterien#Z99cc7e527f81029fbed6e4811b0b12bf) infection over the following year and the need for elective surgery over the following 3 years.\nThere was no difference between the groups in 1-year admission risk, 1-year urgent surgery risk, or 3-year elective surgery risk. In the subgroup of patients aged over 65 years, the 1-year risk of infection with\n[C. difficile](/de/wissen/Systematik_der_Bakterien#Z99cc7e527f81029fbed6e4811b0b12bf) was slightly higher for patients treated with metronidazole and fluoroquinolone (risk difference 0.6%; 95% CI, 0.2\u20131.0).\nLimitations include the retrospective study design based on insurance claims, which may have led to residual\n[confounding](/de/wissen/Studientypen_der_medizinischen_Forschung#Zb4262971e106e4799561831435f78cd1) as a result of missing data on potentially relevant patient characteristics.

High-GI and high-GL diets have been linked to diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in high-income countries; however, this association has not been studied as extensively in other regions of the world. [171]\nThe present study included 137,851 individuals living in high-, middle-, and low-income countries across five continents.

During this period, the investigators recorded 8,780 deaths and 8,252 major cardiovascular events.\nA high-GI diet was associated with an increased risk of a major cardiovascular event or death. This association was seen in participants with preexisting CVD (HR 1.51; 95% CI, 1.25\u20131.82) as well as in those without preexisting CVD (HR 1.21; 1.11\u20131.34).

[189] TTS is typically thought to occur secondary to stressors such as negative life events; and \u2013 as if evidence of an association between [COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7) and increased risk of cardiomyopathy weren\u2019t enough \u2013 it now appears that the burden of the pandemic may be another such [stressor](/de/wissen/Stressmodelle#Z0da157710621c03cf8204068e5bc2e2d). A recent case series by Devika Kir and colleagues discussed two women who presented with TTS. Upon questioning the first patient reported extreme emotional [distress](/de/wissen/Stressmodelle#Z6c7eef5a913c582156005f60a0dd88f1) caused by social isolation, while the second was distressed by her inability to access routine healthcare. [190] The association of pandemic stress and TTS was confirmed by a recent retrospective cohort study by Ahmad Jabri and colleagues, which found that the incidence of TTS among patients presenting with [acute coronary syndrome](/de/wissen/Akutes_Koronarsyndrom#Zbe5972fcd82d1288eb0fda7ed447f69b) increased from 1.5\u20131.8% pre-pandemic to 7.8% during the pandemic (rate ratio = 4.58; 95% CI, 4.11\u20135.11). This increase was not attributable to [SARS-CoV-2](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Za0abd91853146a79d53946ed3db633d3) infection, since all patients in the study were [PCR](/de/wissen/Biochemische_Labormethoden#Z88118df3c49e8662ff7a8ff979911bca) negative. [191] Turns out the owner of a lonely heart is also at risk of owning a broken heart.\nHappy heart\n[syndrome] \u2013 Can a heart also break from happiness? The short answer is: yes. Jelena R. Ghadri and colleagues studied data from the International Takotsubo Registry to determine whether there was an association between positive emotional stress and TTS. Of the 1750 patients with TTS included in the study, 485 reported a definite emotional trigger prior to the diagnosis, with 20 (4.1%) reporting a positive emotional trigger such as winning a jackpot, attending celebrations like birthday parties and weddings, or reveling in one's favorite driver winning a race. [192] Sure, we\u2019re all eager for the [COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7) restrictions to end, but maybe we shouldn\u2019t get too excited when they actually do?\nLove bites \u2013 The consequences of love are many and, unfortunately, include\n[sexually transmitted infections](/de/wissen/Sexuell_\u00fcbertragbare_Infektionen#Zf2a474fc86c5ef68694e80ca13cd405b) ( [STIs](/de/wissen/Sexuell_\u00fcbertragbare_Infektionen#Zf2a474fc86c5ef68694e80ca13cd405b)).

But \u2013 and we do hope this emotional roller coaster ride won't give anyone TTS \u2013 it turns out the news is not so good after all.

As a professional group faced with moral decisions on a daily basis, physicians have always been exposed to their fair share of controversy, but how has social media changed the discourse, and what are the issues stirring the most controversy today?\nThis report discusses an online survey of 464 participants who self-identified as physicians, 57.8% of which were women and 76.9% of which were white. Nearly one-quarter of participants (23.3%) reported personal harassment on social media over the topics of vaccines (n=10), race (n=4), religion (n=3), gun control (n=3), abortion (n=2), and smoking (n=2), with no significant difference between men and women. However, women were significantly more likely than men to report online sexual harassment (16.4% vs 1.5%, P < 0.001), i.e., explicit messages (n=12) and threats of assault (n=2).\nLimitations of the study include the high risk of a reporting and\n[selection bias](/de/wissen/Studientypen_der_medizinischen_Forschung#Zb0d0a6354852d24efe462b33bd4690de), as participants were recruited from the study authors\u2019 Twitter followers; the self-report design of the study, which makes it impossible to confirm the accounts of harassment; and the fact that the majority of participants was white, limiting the generalizability of the results.\nThe take\u2011home message?\nThis report strongly suggests that physicians are no exception with regard to the harassment people face in social media. While anti-vaccination stances are a common trigger, harassment over non-medical issues such as race, religion, and gun control are also prevalent. Moreover, female physicians experience sexual harassment more frequently than their male colleagues, reflecting a similar situation in other areas of social and professional life. A more representative examination is needed to assess the extent of the problem in detail and to determine what actions should be taken to address it.\n- Title of study: Prevalence of personal attacks and sexual harassment of physicians on social media [194]\n- Authors: Pendergrast TR et al.\n- Journal: JAMA Internal Medicine\n[Transfusion](/de/wissen/Transfusionen#Zd803a34f176dcce85995c063e76f09f1) of [plasma] with high antibody levels could reduce mortality in [COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7) \u2013 if the timing is right\nOne-Minute Telegram 18-2021-2/3 - The evidence on whether the\n[transfusion](/de/wissen/Transfusionen#Zd803a34f176dcce85995c063e76f09f1) of [plasma] with anti- [SARS-CoV-2](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Za0abd91853146a79d53946ed3db633d3) [IgG](/de/wissen/Spezifisches_Immunsystem#Zcefedd803831e15fbb5c938286fcf55e) antibodies reduces mortality in [COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7) has so far been inconclusive, and there are no established protocols regarding the timing of the [transfusion](/de/wissen/Transfusionen#Zd803a34f176dcce85995c063e76f09f1) and the levels of antibodies required.
