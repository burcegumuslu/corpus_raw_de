During a ten-day course, participants train to heighten their concentration and perception, in order to use them for a deep look at their own physical and mental reality. This exercise gradually develops one's wisdom and equanimity. Negative behaviour patterns, like for example tension, anger, greed and impatience can be diminished step by step, and positive qualities like balance, tolerance, generosity and compassion can be developed.\nA course in Vipassana offers the opportunity to learn this\n[art of living](/art/), which is also invaluable in everyday life.\nIn the\n[course schedule](https://www.dhamma.org/en/schedules/schdvara) of the meditation centre in Triebel there are usually two ten-day courses offered each month.\nThese courses are taught by assistant teachers of S.N. Goenka, the founder of the Vipassana International Academy in Igatpuri, India.\nThere are no charges for the courses, not even for food and accommodation. All expenses are covered by donations from people who, having completed a course and experienced the benefits of Vipassana, wish to give others the opportunity to also benefit.\nYou can apply for a course by clicking on apply in the\n[course schedule](http://www.dhamma.org/en/schedules/schdvara.shtml).
