Quality of Outcome in Treating Patients with Chronic Headache within a Hospital Specialized for Migraine. A Cohort Study with One-Year Follow-Up Aims: To describe characteristics of in-patients with chronic headache syndromes being treated with complementary methods, short-term effects at time of discharge as well as long-term effects covering a catamnesis of 1year. Methods: The study was designed as a prospective cohort study with outcome measurements 2 months in advance of admission to the hospital, at admission, and at time of discharge, continued by follow-up queries 2, 6 and 12 months after discharge from the hospital. The parameters for describing the course of headache symptoms were registered by questionnaires and diaries. During the first 6 months in 1996, a total of 424 consecutive patients with migraine or tension-type headache at the \u2018Migr\u00e4ne-Klinik K\u00f6nigstein\u2019 were included. Results: 82.9% of the patients were women, the mean age was 46.3 \u00b113.0 years. The median of the duration of the disease was 23 years. At discharge from the hospital there was a marked improvement regarding frequency of headache attacks, intensity of headaches, and concomitant symptoms. 60.5% of the patients were classified as \u2018responders\u2019. 67.5% responded to follow-up questionnaires. With exception of the duration of headache attacks, a significant improvement regarding the 6-monthfollow- up compared to base level was observed. Intake of drugs could be diminished and quality of life was improved. Patients suffering from tension-type headache showed smaller effects in general. Conclusions: Taking into account the mean duration of disease of more than 20 years the results suggest a clinically relevant success from the patients\u2018 view regarding the short-term as well as the long-term course. The problem of data loss with follow-up queries and missing comparative data reduce the conclusiveness of the results.", "sitename": "Karger Publishers", "date": "2001-08-01", "id": null, "license": null, "body": null, "comments": "", "commentsbody": null, "raw_text": null, "text": "Abstract\nQuality of Outcome in Treating Patients with Chronic Headache within a Hospital Specialized for Migraine.
