I contacted UPS via phone and they said the parcel is probably lost you should contact the sender. I send 1-2 emails to amazon about this fact and they kept saying it might arrive and blah blah blah. (parcel never arrived and UPS confirmed it was lost in Poland and will never arrive)\nI was a bit frustrated that they do not want to refund me so I sent them an email that I am not happy and that I did their job and contacted with the carrier and found out myself that the parcel is lost so they should refund me after those long weeks of waiting.\nFinally they refunded me on 7 July 2022. - 2x 800\u20ac for both iPhones so 1600\u20ac all together.\nNow the things started to get interesting.\nI ordered again 2 iPhones but this time iPhone 13 Pro that are 200\u20ac more expensive so I made an order for 2000\u20ac. (as I received more donations during those long 3+ weeks of waiting and I could afford it). That was the same day 7th of July right after I received the refund.\nCouple of hours later I have received this email from Amazon . de\n\"Hello,\nWe have canceled your order and voided the Amazon gift card balance used in the purchase.\nWe took these actions because you tried to use Amazon.de gift cards that are in violation of our terms and conditions. We cannot reissue the Amazon.de gift cards or reimburse you for these funds. Please note that if you purchased your Amazon gift card from a retailer, or obtained it from a third party, they won't be able to reissue the gift cards or reimburse you for these funds.\nIf this activity continues, we may take a permanent action on your account.\nIf you believe we took this action in error, please reply with an attachment of the gift card purchase receipts or other documentation of gift card ownership such as an email or sms from the sender of the gift card, or and image of the physical gift card. When sharing the document, be sure that the name, address, payment type, and relevant transaction information are clearly visible.\nYou can find more information on the Amazon.de Gift Card Terms and Conditions help page:\n[www.amazon.de/gc-legal](http://www.amazon.de/gc-legal)\nAccount Specialist\nAmazon.de*\"*\nI could not believe my own eyes when I read the email.\nReplied to the email right that day, asked what have I done and that why is this happening when I used the same balance for the order that they refunded but now there is a problem? Until now, a moth later they did not address that email.\nShocked as I was I reached to people who donated, at least to people who I was in contact. Others who just donated and disappeared or they do not communicate with me often I have no chance of reaching. I started to pile up documentation and asked them for anything they can provide. I gathered lot of gift card PDF statements and even more screenshot from the orders that they made. I was so tanksful to those people they really spent some time and tried to help me.\nI gathered 90 Pdf/screenshot from Amazon gift card orders they made (exact same that were applied to my account as they donated to me. Aaaaaand nothing .. I sent 5 emails and never got any response.\nI tried to call they customer service several times and they always say it is a special account department we will fill a form for you and they will come back in 24 - 72 hours.\nThey never came back to me.\nAfter lot of waiting and lot of emails and calls I was told by the Customer service person that he can see that my account is still valid and I can use my balance. And that if there would be some big problem they would put my account on hold or close it.\nSo at the time I had 2200\u20ac+ in balance and I decided to order something just to try it.\nI made an order for about 200\u20ac and I successfully ordered it and after couple of days it arrived normally. I thought that everything was ok and I did not want to order something in Fear of loosing money so I kept it there for couple more days until I spotted good deal for PlayStation 5.\nPS5 was for 480\u20ac I think, and the seller had 99% feedback so I decided to order it quick so someone else dont buy it.\nI checked the sellers feedback and translated it from German to English which I did not do before ordering and found out all the feedback was for some keyrings.\nI asked guys from the stream to call in German as I dont speak German.\nThey called the seller and he he said the account was hacked and he dont sell any PlayStations. I was like \"oh great another problem with Amazon like I did not have enough\".\nSo, sent an email to amazon that I spoke with seller and he says he can not log in and his account was stolen etc. I felt like I am helping to solve the issue with stolen account and that they will help the guy to get the access back.\nThey said wait and bla bla bla, if the item does not arrive or is not dispatched we will refund and bla bla. So okey, I am waiting 6 more days.\nI sent a follow up email saying that its been 6 days and still no response from seller (what response when his acc was stolen.. But whatever I did not care about seller anymore at that time) and asked if it can be cancelled please. (that was 21st July)\n3 hours later:\nResponse from Amazon:\n\" Guten Tag!\nwir haben Ihre Daten \u00fcberpr\u00fcft und festgestellt, dass Ihr Amazon.de-Konto geschlossen werden muss. Offene Bestellungen (sofern vorhanden) wurden storniert.\nWeitere E-Mails zu dieser Angelegenheit werden m\u00f6glicherweise nicht beantwortet.\nFreundliche Gr\u00fc\u00dfe\nKontospezialist\nAmazon.de \"\nI do not want to copy what google translate came up with but I believe you already translated that yourself. That is right.. We are closing your account and we will not reply to any more emails regarding this matter.\nSince that.. I am not able to log in anymore into my account.\nNo communication from Accounts Department or Security Department or whatever it is (Not like there was any before that)\nSince the first email from the account department until now I did not receive any communication or any response to my questions.\nI am only able to connect with customer service that does not know anything and they always say that they will make a form to the account department and that I should wait but I will never get any response.\nI was writing to Amazon de Facebook page but the same thing from Social Media Team \"we can not help\".\nI feel extremely powerless fighting a giant like Amazon. I have no idea what should I do.\nThank you if you came all the way down.\nMartin", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["https://reddit.com/en-us/policies/cookies", "https://reddit.com/en-us/policies/privacy-policy", "/", "https://www.reddit.com/login", "https://www.reddit.com/login", "https://ads.reddit.com?utm_source=web3x_consumer&utm_name=user_menu_cta", "/avatar/shop", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage", "https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1064216828", "/r/LegaladviceGerman/", "/r/LegaladviceGerman/", "/r/LegaladviceGerman/", "/user/mato_vt/", "/r/LegaladviceGerman/?f=flair_name%3A%22%3ADE%3A%20DE%22", "http://www.amazon.de/gc-legal", "/r/popular/", "https://reddit.com/t/valheim/", "https://reddit.com/t/genshin_impact/", "https://reddit.com/t/minecraft/", "https://reddit.com/t/pokimane/", "https://reddit.com/t/halo_infinite/", "https://reddit.com/t/call_of_duty_warzone/", "https://reddit.com/t/path_of_exile/", "https://reddit.com/t/hollow_knight_silksong/", "https://reddit.com/t/escape_from_tarkov/", "https://reddit.com/t/watch_dogs_legion/", "https://reddit.com/t/nfl/", "https://reddit.com/t/nba/", "https://reddit.com/t/megan_anderson/", "https://reddit.com/t/atlanta_hawks/", "https://reddit.com/t/los_angeles_lakers/", "https://reddit.com/t/boston_celtics/", "https://reddit.com/t/arsenal_fc/", "https://reddit.com/t/philadelphia_76ers/", "https://reddit.com/t/premier_league/", "https://reddit.com/t/ufc/", "https://reddit.com/t/gamestop/", "https://reddit.com/t/moderna/", "https://reddit.com/t/pfizer/", "https://reddit.com/t/johnson_johnson/", "https://reddit.com/t/astrazeneca/", "https://reddit.com/t/walgreens/", "https://reddit.com/t/best_buy/", "https://reddit.com/t/novavax/", "https://reddit.com/t/spacex/", "https://reddit.com/t/tesla/", "https://reddit.com/t/cardano/", "https://reddit.com/t/dogecoin/", "https://reddit.com/t/algorand/", "https://reddit.com/t/bitcoin/", "https://reddit.com/t/litecoin/", "https://reddit.com/t/basic_attention_token/", "https://reddit.com/t/bitcoin_cash/", "https://reddit.com/t/the_real_housewives_of_atlanta/", "https://reddit.com/t/the_bachelor/", "https://reddit.com/t/sister_wives/", "https://reddit.com/t/90_day_fiance/", "https://reddit.com/t/wife_swap/", "https://reddit.com/t/the_amazing_race_australia/", "https://reddit.com/t/married_at_first_sight/", "https://reddit.com/t/the_real_housewives_of_dallas/", "https://reddit.com/t/my_600lb_life/", "https://reddit.com/t/last_week_tonight_with_john_oliver/", "https://reddit.com/t/kim_kardashian/", "https://reddit.com/t/doja_cat/", "https://reddit.com/t/iggy_azalea/", "https://reddit.com/t/anya_taylorjoy/", "https://reddit.com/t/jamie_lee_curtis/", "https://reddit.com/t/natalie_portman/", "https://reddit.com/t/henry_cavill/", "https://reddit.com/t/millie_bobby_brown/", "https://reddit.com/t/tom_hiddleston/", "https://reddit.com/t/keanu_reeves/", "https://www.redditinc.com", "https://ads.reddit.com?utm_source=web3x_consumer&utm_name=left_nav_cta", "https://www.reddithelp.com", "https://redditblog.com/", "https://www.redditinc.com/careers", "https://www.redditinc.com/press", "https://redditinc.com", "https://www.reddit.com/posts/2022/july-25-1/", "https://www.reddit.com/posts/2022/july/", "https://www.reddit.com/posts/2022/"]}
