Due to an error, certain funds were inadvertently double credited to your account on November 24.\nWe attempted to fix this double credit on the same day by removing the funds from your Coinbase account. But it seems as though you had already transferred or removed these funds from your account. This has resulted in a negative balance on your account.\nAs these duplicate funds are not yours, you will need to deposit the appropriate amount back into the wallet with the negative balance.\nIn order to resolve this negative balance, please:\nSign in to your account (there will be a message that says \u201cYour account has been locked, please visit coinbase.com to resolve\u201d).\nTrade or deposit enough funds or cryptocurrency to make your wallet balance positive.\nPlease deposit 185.66 EUR in your account.\nIf you do not act within 72 hours, Coinbase will take steps to recoup these funds on your behalf. Your account will remain suspended until this issue is resolved.\nWe appreciate your understanding.\nRegards, Coinbase Support\nEdit: My coinbase Account doesn't show that it has been locked.", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["https://reddit.com/en-us/policies/cookies", "https://reddit.com/en-us/policies/privacy-policy", "/", "https://www.reddit.com/login", "https://www.reddit.com/login", "https://ads.reddit.com?utm_source=web3x_consumer&utm_name=user_menu_cta", "/avatar/shop", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage", "https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1064216828", "/r/CoinBase/", "/r/CoinBase/", "/r/CoinBase/", "/user/Aimero/", "/r/popular/", "https://reddit.com/t/valheim/", "https://reddit.com/t/genshin_impact/", "https://reddit.com/t/minecraft/", "https://reddit.com/t/pokimane/", "https://reddit.com/t/halo_infinite/", "https://reddit.com/t/call_of_duty_warzone/", "https://reddit.com/t/path_of_exile/", "https://reddit.com/t/hollow_knight_silksong/", "https://reddit.com/t/escape_from_tarkov/", "https://reddit.com/t/watch_dogs_legion/", "https://reddit.com/t/nfl/", "https://reddit.com/t/nba/", "https://reddit.com/t/megan_anderson/", "https://reddit.com/t/atlanta_hawks/", "https://reddit.com/t/los_angeles_lakers/", "https://reddit.com/t/boston_celtics/", "https://reddit.com/t/arsenal_fc/", "https://reddit.com/t/philadelphia_76ers/", "https://reddit.com/t/premier_league/", "https://reddit.com/t/ufc/", "https://reddit.com/t/gamestop/", "https://reddit.com/t/moderna/", "https://reddit.com/t/pfizer/", "https://reddit.com/t/johnson_johnson/", "https://reddit.com/t/astrazeneca/", "https://reddit.com/t/walgreens/", "https://reddit.com/t/best_buy/", "https://reddit.com/t/novavax/", "https://reddit.com/t/spacex/", "https://reddit.com/t/tesla/", "https://reddit.com/t/cardano/", "https://reddit.com/t/dogecoin/", "https://reddit.com/t/algorand/", "https://reddit.com/t/bitcoin/", "https://reddit.com/t/litecoin/", "https://reddit.com/t/basic_attention_token/", "https://reddit.com/t/bitcoin_cash/", "https://reddit.com/t/the_real_housewives_of_atlanta/", "https://reddit.com/t/the_bachelor/", "https://reddit.com/t/sister_wives/", "https://reddit.com/t/90_day_fiance/", "https://reddit.com/t/wife_swap/", "https://reddit.com/t/the_amazing_race_australia/", "https://reddit.com/t/married_at_first_sight/", "https://reddit.com/t/the_real_housewives_of_dallas/", "https://reddit.com/t/my_600lb_life/", "https://reddit.com/t/last_week_tonight_with_john_oliver/", "https://reddit.com/t/kim_kardashian/", "https://reddit.com/t/doja_cat/", "https://reddit.com/t/iggy_azalea/", "https://reddit.com/t/anya_taylorjoy/", "https://reddit.com/t/jamie_lee_curtis/", "https://reddit.com/t/natalie_portman/", "https://reddit.com/t/henry_cavill/", "https://reddit.com/t/millie_bobby_brown/", "https://reddit.com/t/tom_hiddleston/", "https://reddit.com/t/keanu_reeves/", "https://www.redditinc.com", "https://ads.reddit.com?utm_source=web3x_consumer&utm_name=left_nav_cta", "https://www.reddithelp.com", "https://redditblog.com/", "https://www.redditinc.com/careers", "https://www.redditinc.com/press", "https://redditinc.com", "/best/communities/8/#t5_2woql", "https://www.reddit.com/posts/2020/november-28-1/", "https://www.reddit.com/posts/2020/november/", "https://www.reddit.com/posts/2020/"]}
