Activity in the extract was tracked by HPLC activity profiling, and a total of 15 compounds were characterized. Three compounds, toddalic acid (6) and both enantiomers (7a and 7b) of toddanolic acid (7), were new natural products, and two recently published compounds, (2\u2032R)-toddalolactone 3\u2032-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (10) and (2\u2032S)-toddalolactone 2\u2032-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (11), were described in detail for the first time. The absolute configurations of compounds 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 15 were determined by comparison of experimental and calculated ECD spectra. For glucosides 9 and 10, ECD data and chiral-phase HPLC of the aglycones after enzymatic hydrolysis confirmed the results.
