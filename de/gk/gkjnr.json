(Atemheilkunst), s. p . 5 \n \n \n \n \nPreface \n \nMany students of the University of Music (Department of solo singing and musical \ntheatre) realised a significant improvement of their voices after my osteopathic \ntreatment. This was very interesting for me as I treated many different of their specific \n\u2018sufferings\u2019 but did not primarily emphasize to their \u2018voices\u2019 \u2013 nevertheless their \nvoices improved. Is this sheer coincidence? \n \nThis positive effect was reported to me many times. Dr. Lisa Malin, a trained \nrespiratory therapist who teaches the subject respiratory and body training at the \nUniversity of Music, Vienna, gave me the idea to work on this topic scientifically and \nthus the idea for this paper was born. \n Dr. Lisa Malin has had an active part in my study by treating my comparison group. \nProf. Claudia Visca, who teaches singing at the University of Music, has taken the \nchair. She also invested much time and work for my study by being present at all \ntests and by documenting on them. \n \nA sound engineer recorded all tests which he afterwards compared by means of a \ncomplicated audio-engineering programme. \n \nI especially want to thank these three persons. \n \nDuring my time of research I looked for similar works and theses and finally found a \nfurther paper on the internet, written by two Austrian osteopaths. They submitted a \nthesis at the German College of Osteopathy, entitled \u201eOsteopahtie bei PatientInnen \nmit funktioneller Dysphonie\u201c (\u201aOsteopathic treatment of patients suffering from \nfunctional dysphonia\u2019) \nThere is, however, a fundamental difference between their study and mine. \n\u201eOsteopahtie bei PatientInnen mit funktioneller Dysphonie\u201c (Osteopathic treatment of \npatients suffering from functional dysphonia\u2019) describes the treatment of the \nesophagus and its influence on the human voice. But in my study I treat those lesions \nof the singers that become obvious throughout therapy. So much more interesting is \ntherefore my result. \n \n \n                                            \n  6Abstract \n \nAt the beginning of this paper the question arises if an osteopathic treatment \ninfluences the human voice. The test persons are all vocal students at the \ndepartment of solo singing at the University of Music, Vienna and thus persons with a \nwell trained vocal organ.  \n \nIn the subject \u2018respiratory and body training\u2019 students study and experience \n\u201erespiratory science\u201d. They train the development of their breathing according to the \nrespiratory therapeutic principle in an active as well as passive way and so learn to \nwork actively on their breathing.  \n \nIn this paper the osteopathic concept will be contra posed to the respiratory \ntherapeutic concept. Both concepts will be described with their corresponding \nphilosophies and techniques used in this study. Furthermore all anatomic and \nmechanic connections relevant for the form ation of sounds will be illuminated.  \n \nPractical tests will be presented by means of an explanation of the methodological design according to which they were carried out. Students undergo three different \ntests. An arbitrary tone will be adopted, a tone will be held as long as possible and a \ntriad will be vocalised. The comparative va lues act as references for another test \nafter the osteopathic and respiratory therapeutic treatment.  \n \nThis paper shall describe variables, reliability and validity and explain the process of \ntesting. Three different sources for documentation are available: an audio \nengineering programme that records all tests and graphs the results, the subjective \nassessment of vocal teachers and the feedback of students.  \n \nThe osteopathic treatment merely adjusts to \u201aosteopathic lesions\u2019 found during the \nexamination of the students. This is how this paper differs from another paper with a \ncomparable topic, in which, however, always the same structure is treated. (The \npaper mentioned is going to be quoted in this present paper.)\n1 \n \nThe results of the present study show that an osteopathic treatment has a clear \ninfluence on the human voice. Graphic representations of the tests are to be found in \nthe appendix. \n \n                                            \n1 cf. Steiner, C./ Welz, E., (Dysphonie).   7Table of contents \n \n1.

Introduction \n \nThe present treatise deals with the questi on if an osteopathic therapy influences the \nhuman voice. This paper is going to show th at the integrated concept of osteopathy, \napplied to students of university of music, caused a change in their voices although \nthe voice was not the main object of the osteopathic treatment. \n \nDuring my examinations on these vocal students I was looking for osteopathic \nlesions which I treated. The fact that a singer\u2019s voice is their potential to turn \noutwards and it depends on this potential if he or she  is well-rated or not makes it \nvery interesting of course to observe how many structures influence the voice. \n \nThis thesis offers no \u2018recipe\u2019 provided which structures should be medicated to \ninfluence the human voice. \u2018Lesion found \u2013 lesion treated\u2019 is the motto of my therapy. \n \nThis study has been noticed with a lot of interest by the university of music as for the \nattendant music professor it was very interesting to observe, to which extent a singer \ncould tap their own potential often much better after a treatment.  \nThe aim of this treatise is to show that the quality of the voice can be influenced by \nan osteopathic therapy. Different tests which have been documented and compared \n(an audio engineering program, documentation of a music teacher and feedback by \nstudents) provide valuable results. \n \nThe condition of the voice, the breathing and the body altogether have clearly \nnoticeable affects on the vocal achievement. The present paper is concentrating on \nthe main points of the effect of an osteopathic concept on students. The results are \ncompared with a peer group which has been examined and treated according to the \nconcept of respiration therapy. I decided to  use the concept of the respiratory therapy \nfor my comparison group because the students of the university of music are taught \nin the subject \u2018breathing\u2019 by Dr. Lisa Malin according to the respiratory therapeutic \nconcept in an active and passive way. Like osteopathy, the concept of respiratory \ntherapy is according to philosophical found ations, so it was quite obvious to choose \nthis peer group. \n \nThis works hypothesis is that the osteopathic treatment influences the human voice. \n \n \n \n2. The osteopathic concept \n \nIn osteopathy you use your hands for diagnosis and therapy \u2013 these are so called \nsheer manual techniques \u2013 whereas humans should be perceived as individuals in \ntheir integrity. The aim of osteopathy is th e rebuilding of the system of the organism \u2013 \nthe cure of dysfunctions and the animation of self-healing forces.2 \n \n                                            \n2 cf. Ligner, B. / van Assche, R. (Ligner), p. 14.  10An osteopath needs precise knowledge of anatomy, physiology and biomechanics to \nidentify structural or visceral problems and changes inside the liquid or hormonal \nsystem and to affect them.3 \n \n2.1. History of osteopathy \n \nThousands of years ago manual treatments have been already carried out. This is \nproved by 4000 year old sculptures from Thailand that attest the use of manual \ntechniques. Also the ancient Egyptians cur ed injuries and illnesses by means of their \nhands. Even Hippocrates utilized such techniques \u2013 for example traction and lever \ntechniques \u2013 to cure vertebral contortion. \n \nAs time drew on manual healing techniques were incumbent on \u2018Badern\u2019 (quack \ndoctors). Also the appearance of epidemics was responsible for the loss of close \ncontact to patients.4 \n \nDr. Andrew Taylor Still (1828 \u2013 1917) revitalised this ancient knowledge and extended it into the medical sector of osteopathy.\n5 \n \nOn the basis of dissection and accurate anatomical studies he detected coherence \nbetween limitations of functions and their consequences on other structures. That is \nhow the basics of today\u2019s biomechanics accrued.6 Dr. Still taught at the \u2018American \nSchool of Osteopathy\u2019 in Missouri. In addition to a \u2018normal\u2019 medical education a more \nspecific way of anatomy was taught at this university \u2013 as well as diagnostics of \nfunctional disorders of joints and their adjustments. Dr. Still called those functional \ndisorders \u2019osteopathic lesion\u2019. \n \nThe osteopathic lesion is related to skeletal, articular and myofascial structures as \nwell as the vessels, lymphatics and nerves connected to it.7  \n\u201cDer Schwerpunkt liegt dabei auf der ver\u00e4nderten Funktion des muskuloskelettalen \nSystems und nicht auf einer Erkrankung oder einem Schmerzsyndrom. Besteht eine \nsomatische Dysfunktion, die mit Ver\u00e4nderungen am Gef\u00e4\u00dfsystem, am lymphatischen \nSystem und am Nervensystem einhergeht, dann k\u00f6nnen selbstverst\u00e4ndlich s\u00e4mtliche \nandere Symptome vorliegen, beginnend bei unklaren Schmerzzust\u00e4nden bis hin zu \nexakt definierten Krankheitsbildern.8\u201d  \n[Thereby the emphasis lies on the altered function of the musculoskeletal system and \nnot on an illness or a pain syndrome. If there is a somatic dysfunction which comes \nalong with an alteration in the vascular system, the lymphatic system and the \nnervous system it is of course possible that there will be every other symptom, \nbeginning with indefinite pain right up to accurately defined disease pattern] \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n3 cf. Ligner, B. / van Assche, R. (Ligner) \n4 cf. Greenman, P. (Greenman), p. 21. \n5 cf. Ligner, B./ van Assche R. (Ligner), p. 15. \n6 cf. Ibid., p. 16. \n7 cf. Greenman, P. (Greenman), p. 29. \n8 cf. ibid., p. 29.  11Philosophy of osteopathy  \n \nStill developed the five osteopathic principles. \n \n1. Live is movement \n2. Structure rules function \n3. The body works as a unit \n4. Arterial rule \n5. Self-healing mechanisms9 \n \nDetails to the described principles will follow later on in the thesis at hand.10 \n \nIn 1917 Dr. Littlejohn brought osteopathy to Europe. In the fifties the \u2018European \nSchool of Osteopathy\u2019 was founded in Maidstone (GB). The \u201cWiener Schule f\u00fcr \nOsteopathie\u201d (Viennese School of Osteop athy) was founded in 1991 which brought \nthe concept of Osteopathy to Austria. \n \n \n2.2. Concepts of osteopathy \n In osteopathy you can distinguish between  different concepts. For all of those \nconcepts direct and indirect techniques are valid. At the direct technique a bone or a \ntissue is straightly moved in the direction of a limited movement or a blockage to refit \nthe natural mobility. At the indirect technique you move to the opposite direction of \nthe natural mobility. The aim of the indirect technique is to loose spasms of the tissue \nholding against it. \nThis is also a way to relax the bands and membranes of the joint connections and as \na consequence recover the physiological mobility of tissue.\n 11 \n \nA description of the osteopathic concepts will follow. I have used all these concepts \nin my treatments except for the techniques mentioned in point 2.2.1.5. To keep the \nintegrity of the osteopathic concept I additionally cite the technique under point \n2.2.1.5. (somato-release).12 \n \n2.2.1. structural Osteopathy \n Structural Osteopathy works on the palpation and correction of bones, muscles, \nsinews, ligaments and fascias. \n \n2.2.1.1. Osteoarticular techniques \n \nThe osteoarticular techniques comprise mobilization and manipulation of off centre and blocked joints. At Thrust-techniques (manipulation technique) you can \n                                           \n \n9  cf. Greenman, P. (Greenman), p. 17. \n10 see p. 15 ff. in the paper at hand. \n11 cf. Liem, T., Tsolodimos, C., (Osteopathie), p. 70. \n12 see p. 13 in the paper at hand.   12distinguish between the \u2018cervical wheel\u2019 in the cervical spin, the \u2018dog\u2019- and \u2018lift\u2019-\ntechniques in the thoracic vertebral column, the \u2018lumbar roll\u2019 for the lumbar spine and \ndifferent manipulations on the sacrum. You can also manipulate every other joint of \nthe body. A manipulation is a high speed technique at which as few strength has to \nbe used because of an advantageous appointed angle.  \n \nMobilization works with less speed, however it  concerns nearly every structure of the \nbody. Apart from joints this is also musculature, sinews, ligaments, nerves, vessels, \nfascias and scars. \n \nAccording to Greenman you should be treated through manual therapy techniques if \na somatic dysfunction is diagnosed. 13 \n \n2.2.1.2. Soft tissue techniques  \n \nAt these techniques you influence on one hand the tension of different body tissues, \non the other hand it is about loosing \u2018clotted\u2019 structures. The point is \u2018to bring \nmovement into tissue\u2019 and with this enhance nutrient and oxygen supply. Moreover \nthose techniques can animate the decom position of waste products of the \nmetabolism, fortify the immune system and cause a beneficial relaxation. \n \nAn example of \u2018soft tissue techniques\u2019 is \u2018inhibition\u2019. \nAt \u2018inhibition\u2019 a muscle is expanded into the lateral direction and held like this until it \nhas changed its tension.14 \n \n2.2.1.3. Neuromuscular reprogrammation techniques  according to Dr. L. H. \nJones \n \nAt these techniques you bring the affected joint into a position which is as free from \npain as possible. Mostly this position is situated in direction of the lesion. If you leave \nit in this position for a longer time (up to 90 seconds) the tension of the joint can be \nimproved. In most cases also a \u2018trigger point\u2019 is held, which can be, according to \nJanet Travell, associated with every lesion.15  \n \n2.2.1.4. Muscle energy technique according to Dr. F. L. Mitchell \n \nThese techniques work through active muscle contraction of the patient. The \ntherapist brings the joint close to its motorial barrier. The patient performs an \nisometric contraction into the opposite direction. This is the direction of the lesion. \nThe therapist offers resistance. After a relaxation the joint is being brought again to \nthe new motorial barrier.16  \n                                            \n13 cf. Liem, T., Tsolodimos, C. (Osteopathie), p. 29 \n14 cf. ibid., p. 87. \n15 cf. Ligner, B. / van Assche, R., (Ligner), p. 21. \n16 cf. ibid., p. 20, f.   132.2.1.5. Somato-Emotional-Release according to Dr. J. E. Upledger \n \nUpledger describes a working model which uses the image of so called \u2018energy cysts\u2019 \nin consequence of traumas. Vector-like forc e on different tissues caused by psychic \ntraumas produce an energy congestion. Duri ng the therapy the patient often adopts \npositions which he or she knows from the trauma.17  \n \n2.2.1.6. Myofascial techniques \n \nBase of this techniques is the so called \u2018fascial distortion model\u2019 that has been developed by Typaldos.\n18 It is an anatomic model whereby lesions of the supporting \napparatus and musculoskeletal system are regarded as a change of one or more \nfascial distortion types. \n \nThe fascial distortion model distinguishes between six main types: \n \nThe trigger band describes a twisted fascial ligament. \n The trigger point hernia describes an abnormal protrusion of tissue through the \nfascial level. \n \nThe continuum distortion describes a change of the transition zone between \nligament, tendon and the like and bone. \n \nThe fold distortion means a three-dimensional change of the fascial level. \n \nAt a cylinder distortion you talk about an overlap of the cylindrical coil convolution of \nthe surficial fascias. \n \nAt a tectonic anchorage you talk about a change of the ability to slide of the fascial \nsurface.\n19 \n \nTrigger bands are treated with the Trigger band technique.20 \n \nThe trigger point hernias are treated by exertion of pressure.21 \n \nThe continuum technique comprises of the hard and uninterrupted pressure on a \ncontinuum distortion that moves a described transition zone.22 \n \nAt the fold distortions you distinguish between unfold distortions and fold in \ndistortions. Those distortions are treated by means of fold techniques.23 \n \n                                            \n17 cf. Ligner, B. / van Assche, R., (Ligner), p.22. \n18 cf. Typaldos, S., (Typlados), p. 15. \n19 cf. ibid., p. 23. \n20 cf. ibid., p. 29. \n21 cf. ibid., p. 37. \n22 cf. ibid., p. 42. \n23 cf. ibid., p. 47.  14The cylinder distortions are treated by means of cylinder techniques. Here you \ndistinguish between nettle techniques, double thumb techniques and abstracting \ntechniques.24 \n \nTectonic anchorages are treated by means of tectonic techniques. Here you \ndistinguish for example between \u2018frog leg technique\u2019 and \u2018inverse frog leg technique\u2019, \nwhip technique, suck technique, cupping technique, Kirksville crunch for the thoracic \nspine, lumbar roll for the lumbar spine and the neutral thrust for the cervical spine.25 \n \n2.2.2. Craniosacral osteopathy \n Based on Dr. Still craniosacral osteopathy has been evolved by Dr. William Garner \nSutherland (a student of Dr. Still). \n \nOne of the essential works of literature for osteopathy called \u2018The Cranial Bowl\u2019 was \npublished by Sutherland in 1939. Dr. H. I. Magoun caused the breakthrough of those \ntheories with his piece of literature called \u2018Osteopathy in the Cranial Field\u2019.\n26 \n \nThe craniosacral osteopathy is based on the concept of the craniosacral rhythm, a \nrhythm of the body which influences the metabolism of the organism and every body \ncell. The craniosacral rhythm moves the cranial bones and every other bone \nsmoothly in a frequency from six to fourteen in flexion and extension respectively in \nlateral and internal rotation. Very early, namely during the embryonal development, \nthis rhythm sets in and you can even palpate it after death.27 \n \nIn craniosacral osteopathy you search for the \u201cfulcum\u201d (a centre of movement, a point \nof rest) or the \u201cinner eye of a hurricane\u201d. An example for a fulcum is the \u201cSinus \nRectus\u201d (Sutherland Fulcum).28 To keep the balance of the movement of the \nmembrane and the tensions in every direction, the membranes themselves operate \nfrom a fulcum. This fulcum has to move automatically. An osteopathic access to \ncraniosacral therapy is to search this fulcum, focus on it and therewith help the \nmembran to change it. Shortly before the tension changes a so called \u201cStill-Point\u201d \narises. This \u201cStill Point\u201d is a snap-shot after which the tissue can realign itself. \n \nIn craniosacral osteopathy you work a lot on the skull \u2013 a profound knowledge of the \nsutures of the skull (which are the cranial sutures, the connections between the \ncranial bones) and their Pivot points (those are the changes in alignment) is a \nprecondition. At this work on the skull the cranial sutures are examined and \nblockages at these sutures are abolished trough direct and indirect techniques. \n \nAlthough you work a lot at the skull you ca n influence other structures of the body, \nstarting from the skull. So you also work a lot with humours, vessels, the nervous \nsystem and the immune system. \n \n                                            \n24 cf.

Visceral osteopathy \n \nThe visceral osteopathy was developed by Thure Brand in 1890 and has been \nestablished amongst others through the works of Jean-Pierre Barral.29 In the visceral \nosteopathy you also talk about osteopathic lesions. This can affect the mobility and \nmotility of an organ. Mobility is the flexibility of an organ concerning its ambience. \nPhysiological this movement happens because of the pressure of the diaphragmatic \nmotion.30 Motility is the proper motion of an organ. For every organ there is a typical \nmotility.31 \n \nEvery organ has got an inner strength to maintain against gravity. Organs and \nviscera carry themselves and so they do not need to be stabilized from outside. If an \norgan looses this ability it will need exterior forces.32 Changes that result from this \ndevelopment can be treated with visceral-osteopathic techniques. \n \n \n2.3. Principles of osteopathy \n \nLiterally translated osteopathy means \u201cmor bid change of the bone\u201d (\u201costeon\u201d \u2013 bone; \n\u201cpatos\u201d \u2013 condition). This can lead to misunderstanding. Still choose this name \nbecause he started his research of the bone. Since he began to normalise the \nosseous skeleton.33  \n \nOsteopathy is philosophy, science and art, all in one. The philosophy deals with the \nconcept of unity of structure and function of the organism in a well-being as well as in \nan ill status. From a scientific point of view it is biology, chemistry and physics in \nservice of health as well as prevention,  healing and abatement from illnesses. The \nuse of this philosophy and science in practice is the art of osteopathic medicine.34 \n \n2.3.1. \u201cLife is movement\u201d \n \nPrecondition for an osteopathic treatment is cognition of a limitation of movement \u2013 \nmobility and motility. \nThe limitation of mobility in tissues leads to the fact that not only the supply of oxygen \nand nutrimental substances is not assured \u2013 also the evacuation is reduced. Still also \nreconstructed the relation of the limitati on of functions and their influence on other \nstructures by dissecting corpses.35  \n \nFor the expression of motility see point 2.2.3. visceral osteopathy.36 \n \n                                            \n29 cf.

Ligner, B. / van Assche, R., (Ligner), p. 16. \n36 see p. 15 of the paper at hand.  162.3.2. \u201cStructure rules function\u201d \n \nStill used this principle in the sense of absorption of the whole body.37 \nStructure and function are connected in a close interrelation and influence each \nother. \n \nFor example a proximal phalangeal joint is a hinge joint (structure). Such a joint has \nto accomplish movements for bending and stretching (function). Because of a long-\nlasting wilful or arbitrary over- or underload of a part of the body, which means a \nchange of its original function, the structure can be mutated.38 \n \nAnother point in this coherence is that this interplay exists not only locally but can \nimpinge globally on the body. For examples changes and false positions of a joint \ncause problems in other parts of the body. A distortion of the ankle joint for instance \ncan lead to an exertion in the stabilising ligaments and thus to a reflectory contraction \nof the \u201cmusculus biceps femoris\u201d. T he consequence is a dysfunction in foot and \nknee.39 \n \n2.3.3. \u201cThe body works as a unit\u201d   \n \nThe human being is a unit of body, soul and spirit. Whether a person feels healthy, ill, \nhappy or sad and also if he or she is healthy for a long period of time is dictated by a \nhuge number of physical and psychological processes. They are intrinsically tied to \neach other and so you have to see it as a unit. That is the reason why osteopaths \nthink and cure holistically.40 \n \n\u201cLife proves its perfection by its work\u201d41 \n \n2.3.4. \u201cThe arterial law\u201d \n A well-functioning circulation of fluids is considered as the highest value in the human \norganism and so it is the most important factor in osteopathy because life has to be \nnourished. This term is not only confined to the arterial and venous system but \ncomprises also liquor, lymph, synovial fluid, gas exchange and unhindered \ntransmission of nerve impulses. Tissues with insufficient supply rather tend to \npathologies.\n42 \n \n2.3.5. \u201c Self-healing mechanism\u201d  \n \nHealth is the result of a string of self-regulating processes of the immune system, the \nendocrine system, the autonomous nervous system and other regulation systems. \n                                            \n37 cf.

(Ligner), p. 23  17Starting to work on this and to bring it to an optimal dimension of power without \novertaxing the body is the aim of the osteopath.43  \n \n \n3. The human voice \n \nA description of the human voice \u2013 its structure, its scope and how it is influenced \u2013 \nnow follows. \n \nThe human voice is an organ of communication which produces a tone on phonation \nrespiration, additive synthesis  and sound shaping  (as different sub- processes). \nSimilar to the structure of a wind instrument, the air streams from a \u201cwind space\u201d \n(trachea, bronchi, etc.) through the gap of the vibratory vocal cords (vocal ligaments) \ninto the \u201cair space\u201d which consists of pharynx, mouth and nasal cavity.44 \n \nSpeech and voice develop during the phase of expiration, which means during that \ntime when the diaphragm swings back to its initial situation. The power,  that is \nnecessary for exhalation, has to be measured out to enable a tone keeping its \ntension. An inspiratory countertension  has to be produced.45 \nAs you can vary the strength of the  air space (the volume of the sound results from \nthat) as well as the tension of the vocal cords and the width and shape of the fissure \nof glottis (the general sound colour of the voice results from that) and also the air \nspace in size and form (the timbre results from that), therefore you need a lot of \nmuscles.  Vocal ligaments and the vocal cord and their adjustment are regulated by \nthe joints and mussels of the larynx. The signals which influence the vagus nerve \nstem from the motosensoric cortex. The v agus nerve provides the larynx motorically \nas well as sensitively, which is import ant for phonation and in the same enables an \nadverse-effects reflex  for coughing.46 \n \nSensitive fibres of mucous membrane of the larynx and sensoric fibres of muscle \nspindle send impulses to the centre to report about the position and tension of the \nvocal ligaments. There are close connections to the auditory pathway with the bulbar \nand cortical centres of the motor functions of speech. The conditions are necessary \nfor fine tuning of the voice. When the air flow causes the vocal cords to vibrate, they do not simply open and close, but swing into the direction which is preset by the air \nflow in a kind of rolling motion. At rather deep notes the glottis is closed for a longer \ntime than opened (ratio 5:1 at 100 Hz), at higher notes (400 Hz) the ratio sinks to \n1.4:1. If you sing with head voice or whisper the glottis is not closed at all.\n46  \n \nThe frequency range of the human voice varies from about 40 Hz up to 2000 Hz and \nmore. While speaking the vocal range contains approximately one octave, singers \nuse up to three octaves.46  \n \n                                            \n43 cf. Ligner, B. / van Assche, R. (Ligner), p. 24. \n44 cf. Kittel, G., (Phonaitrie), p. 17. \n45 cf. Richter, H., (Atemwelten), p. 99. \n46 cf. Steiner, C. / Welz, E., (Dysphonie), p. 39 ff. \n   18A description of the anatomy, the functional anatomy and the physiology for \nproducing a tone follows.  \n \n \n3.1. The vocal organ from an anatomic and from a functional point \nof view \n \nThe main sectors of the vocal organ are the larynx, the muscular network in which \nthe larynx is hung in (connecting mechanism) and the respiratory system. \n \nThe skeleton of the larynx  (larynx) consists of two arytenoid cartilages, a thyroid \ncartilage and a cricoid cartilage. The thyroid cartilage  is linked to the cricoid cartilage  \nby two joints. Because of this connection you can do a tipping movement with both \ncartilages. Also the arytenoid cartilages  are linked to the cricoid cartilage and by this \nconnection of joints it is flexible and turnable in a triple manner.  \n \n \nFigure 1- function of the arytenoid cartilage47 \n \n \nDuring the deglutition the epiglottis  (Cartilago epiglottica \u2013 a leaf shaped, elastic \ncartilage) closes the entrance of the throat. The epiglottis can lift and lower itself and \nis affixed with a ligament at the rear side of the thyroid cartilage. The larynx is \nhanged at the hyoid bone. The muscles that start at the larynx are important for \nphonation. \n The two vocal folds\n are laid in the framework of cartilages that has been described \nabove. Because of their vibrancy they make the exhaled air swinging \u2013 let the voice \narouse. During that you can distinguish between the vocal cords (the inner body of \nthe muscle of the vocal folds) and the vocal ligaments (the upper longitudinal strain of \nthe tissue in which the vocal cords are embedded).48 \n \n                                            \n47 cf. l. Waldeyer, A. / Mayet, A.., (Anatomie 2), p. 143. \n48 cf. Husler, F. / Rodd-Marling, Y. (Singen), p. 32 ff. and Waldeyer, A./ Mayet, A., (Anatomie 2), p.138 \nff. \n 19The vocal ligaments  (ligamentum vocale) are the upper border that is spread out \nbetween the proc. Vocalis, the arytenoid cartilage and the rear side of the voice \ncartilage. The vocal ligaments consist of undulated, colagene and elastic fibres. The \nconus elasticus is a tapered funnel beginning at the cricoid cartilage and ending in \nthe vocal ligaments.49 \n \nThe vocal cords  are able to tense and to relax separately so they can change the \nshape of the vocal cord and the fissure of glottis (gap between the vocal folds). The \nvocal cord is a tension mechanism which braces the vocal folds up and down as well \nas forward, backward and outward. The fissure of glottis is opened during breathing \n(respiratory position) but while phonation it is rather closed (phonation position). \n \n \n            \n \nFigure 2- Vocal ligaments in respiration position50 \n \n \nFigure 3- Vocal ligaments in phonation position51 \n \n \n \nThe vocal ligaments are not able to move autonomously in contrast to the muscular \nvocal cords. Primarily they are expanded and consequently extended and thinned by \ncricoid \u2013 thyroid cartilage muscle. The tone pitch depends on thickness and tension \nof the vocal ligaments. The more elongation and tension, the higher the tone. \n \nA singers voice material emerges only until the vocal cord and the vocal ligaments \n(extensor and expander) activate themselves out of one impulse and at the same \ntime while producing the voice.52  \n                                            \n49 cf. Waldeyer, A. / Mayet, A., (Anatomie 2), p. 142 ff. \n50 cf. Pschyrembel, (Pschyrembel), Figure 279. \n51 cf. ibid., Figure 279.   20 \n \n \n3.1.1. Anatomic description of the muscles of larynx \n \nA detailed numeration of the muscles of the larynx, that influence the larynx but also \nthe vocal ligaments as well as the voice, follows. I did not emphasize especially on \nthose in my treatment but it is necessary to describe them to gain an insight into the \nformation of a tone. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4- muscles of larynx \u2013 shown from the right hand side53 \n \nThe muscles of the larynx are divided into the sphincter internus muscle and the  \nsphincter externus muscle. \nThe sphincter externus muscle (cricothyroideus muscle = \u201canticus\u201d) emanates of the \ncricoid cartilage and passes over into inferior horn of the thyroid cartilage. Its effect is \nto nourish the cricoid and thyroid cartilage and to bring the vocal ligament into a \n\u201capproximate tension\u201d.54 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                        \n52 cf. Waldeyer, A. / Mayet, A., (Anatomie 2), p. 138 ff. \n53 cf. ibid., p. 143. \n54 cf. ibid., p. 144. \n 21The sphincter internus muscle consists of the following muscles: \n \n\u2022 Cricoarytenoideus posterior muscle (\u201cmusculus posticus\u201d the clinican). This is \nthe only one which opens the fissure of glottis. \n\u2022 Cricoarytenoideus lateralis muscle \u2013 this one closes the intermembranous part \nof the fissure of glottis while the intercartilaginous part stays open. So it is \nresponsible for whisper. \n\u2022 Arytenoideus transversus muscle and arytenoideus obliquus muscle connect \nthe arytenoid cartilages and thus help closing the intercartilaginous part. \n\u2022 Thyroarytenoideus muscle \u2013 its inner fibre content passes into the vocalis \nmuscle (= vocal muscle). \n\u2022 Vocalis muscle \u2013 according to Waldeyer this one is responsible for fine \nadjustment and fine tension of the vocal ligament.55 \n \nAs there have been singers treated in this study and as the production of a sung tone \nis a very complex process, the functional interaction of all factors responsible for \nvocalisation and their coherence is described afterwards. \n \nAccording to Husler/ Rodd-Marling the vocal ligaments need further muscles as \ntakers and antagonists to hold out against the tension of the inner vocal fold muscles \nwhile vocalisation. The muscle \u2018musculus posticus\u2019 \u2013 cricoarytenoideus posterior \nmuscle (\u2018opener\u2019) is located on the rear side of the larynx arranged in couples and \nopens the throat to clear space for drawing breath.56 \n \nThe \u2018closers\u2019 (cricoarytenoideus posterior muscle, interarytenoideus muscle) \ndecrease the gap between the vocal folds defining the shape of the fissure of glottis. \nThe more the vocal folds converge the more  \u2018concentrated\u2019 the tone sounds. Through \nnarrowing the fissure of glottis the \u2018throatiness\u2019 of the voice is abolished.57 \n \nThe human voice gets the precision and the individual expression out of the \u2018fine \ntuning\u2019 of a complex muscular system which lays in the vocal fold. This muscular \nsystem discharges into the very margin of the vocal ligaments (\u2018margin muscles\u2019). \nThe vocal folds can be modified by these muscles in many different ways and so a \nunlimited possibility of distinction of the mass of sound is allowed. This is necessary \nfor producing vocal values. Those muscles (lateralis muscle and transversus muscle) \nare the bridge between the \u2018thoracic- and head-falsetto-register\u2019 \u2013 and build a unity \nbetween both of those main registers.58 \n \n3.1.2. The anatomic surrounding of larynx \n \nFor successful physiological singing the \u201celastic\u201d framework of the larynx is essential \u2013 those net of pairs of muscles, in which the larynx is actively chucked in. Among \nthose lie the \u201clevators\u201d which pull the larynx up: the thyroid cartilage muscle and the \nhyoid bone muscle (thyreohyoideus muscle), palate larynx muscle (palatolaryngeus \nmuscle) and the stylopharyngeus muscle (lifts and expands the pharyngeal space). \n                                           \n \n55 cf. Waldeyer, A./ Mayet, A.., (Anatomie 2), p. 144. \n56 cf. Husler, F. / Rodd-Marling, Y., (Singen), p. 40 f and Waldeyer, A. / Mayet, A., (Anatomie 2), p. 142 \n57 cf. Husler, F. / Rodd-Marling, Y., (Singen), p. 41. \n58 cf. ibid., p. 43.  22Furthermore the \u201ccountersinks\u201d that pull t he larynx down: the pair of sternum thyroid \ncartilage muscle (sternothyreohyoideus muscle), the cricopharyngeus muscle \n(anchors the cricoid cartilage so that the thyroid cartilage can move freely on the \ncricoid cartilage); the trachea (pulls the larynx down) and the gullet (pulls backwards \nand down). \nThe elastic framework of the larynx is one of the most important organic connections \nbetween the head voice and the chest voice. Vocal gifted singers are to be \ncharacterised by \u201ccolumnar throats\u201d that comply to a distinctive \u201chook in musculature\u201d \n(elastic framework).59 \nThe spaces above the vocal folds (gullet, mouth room) are indicated as \u201cconnecting \ntube\u201d. Thereby the formation of this room is not as important for the quality of the \nvoice as the perimeter of the hook in mechanism. Therefore the main focus is on the \nconversion of the vocal organ.60 \n \n3.1.3. Fascial structure of the neck \n \nThe connective tissue of the throat builds firm membranes that serve as guiding \ntubes for muscles or as cover for organs and so it permits the ability to slide for the \nample moves of the bowels (swallowing, talking, choking, etc.) \n \nYou distinguish between three cervical fascias: \n \nSuperficial lamina of cervical fascia:  (fascia colli superficialis): lies beneath the skin \nand the platysma and enwraps the whole throat as coherent bandage, caudal it \nbegins at the lower jaw. It envelopes the two sternocleidomastoideus muscles and \nthe two trapezius muscles. \n \nPretracheal lamina of cervical fascia:  (fascia colli media): goes from the hyoid bone \nto the inner surface of the collarbones and to the sternum. \n \nPrevertebral lamina of cervical fascia:  (fascia colli profunda): continues prior to the \nspine and the prevertebral muscles, covers the scalenus muscles and the levator \nmuscle and passes dorsal into the superficial fascias.61 \n \nI am aware of the fact that the throat, the respiratory organ and the vocal organ are \ninfluenced a lot by the muscles of the thorax, the back, the throat and the head. But \ndescribing this here would extravagate this thesis. \n \n \n3.2. The respiratory organ from an anatomic and a functional point \nof view \n \nOf course respiratory muscles and auxiliary respiratory muscles are counted among the physiological necessities for phonation. An illustration of the respiratory organ \n                                           \n \n59 cf. Husler, F. / Rodd-Marling, Y., (Singen), p. 46 ff. \n60 cf. ibid., p. 50 f.  \n61 cf. Waldeyer, A. / Mayet, A., (Anatomie 2), p.163.  23follows in this paper just insofar as it is relevant for the description of the techniques \nused at this study. \n \n3.2.1. The lungs \n \nThe lung is a paired organ and it is shaped like a cone that rests upon the diaphragm. The apex of lung rises through the upper thorax aperture into the region \nof the throat.\n62 \n \nThe lungs (pulmones) lie in the chest ca vity and are connected with each other by \nmeans of the lung shaft. The lung consists of  several lobes of lung. Those lobes of \nlung add up to an anatomic and physiologic unity. The main bronchus passes into \ntwo lobar bronchi for the left lung and three lobar bronchi for the right one. Segment \nbronchi emanate from the lobar bronchi, which again split up into terminal \nbronchioles.63 \n \nThe basis of the lung rests on the diaphragm with its diaphragmatic fascia. The apex \nof lung goes ventral from two to three c entimetres above the clavicle dorsal to the \nupper frame of the first rib. The inferior part of lung reaches the upper renal pole \nwhile inhaling. The costodiaphragmatic recess reaches until behind the upper third of \nthe kidney.64 \n \nThe left lung consists of two lobes of lung whereby the dividing line between the two \nlobes is called oblique fissure of left lung. It goes from the fourth costovertebral joint \nto the sixth condrosternal joint. The right l ung consists of three lobes whereby these \nlobes are divided by two fissures: the oblique fissure of right lung which goes from \nthe third costovertebral joint posterior forward to the sixth rib, and the horizontal \nfissure of right lung that goes from the fourth rib backwards to the third condrosternal \njoint.65 \n \nEvery lung lies in a pleural cavity. This pleural cavity is coated with parietal pleura. \nThe lung is put into pleura sack. The Space between those two pleura sacks is called \nmediastinum.66 There are important connections reaching from the cupula of pleura \nto the spine and its joints. \n \nIn this context it is important to mention three ligaments as they have been influenced \nduring my osteopathic treatment: \n \n\u2022 Ligamentum transverso-pleurale:  this goes from the transverse process from \nC7 to the lateral part of the suprapleural membrane. \n\u2022 Ligamentum costo-pleurale : this goes from the throat of the first rib to the \nupper part of the suprapleural membrane. \n\u2022 Ligamentum vertebro-pleurale: this goes from the prevertebral aponeurosis \nfrom C6, C7 and Th1 to the inner part of the suprapleural membrane.67 \n                                            \n62 cf.

Ligner, B., (Throax/Lunge), p. 5.  24 \nZangenfeind distinguishes between external and internal respiration. The external \nrespiration includes the gas exchange that takes place inside the lungs where \noxygen rich air is absorbed. Here the oxy gen is emitted to the blood by air vesicles. \nCarbon dioxide, which is released by the blood, effuses while exhaling. At the internal \nrespiration the blood carries the oxygen to cells, that need it for their metabolism, and \nreceives the waste product carbon dioxide from the tissues. The respiratory \nmovement expands the lung tissue and lets it sink down. For this three-dimensional \nexpansion the respiratory muscles and the auxiliary respiratory muscles are \nnecessary. The main respiratory muscle is the diaphragm.68 \n \n3.2.2. The pericardium \n \nThe heart sac (pericardium) is a fibrous sack nerved by the big vessels of the heart. The pericardium is anchored by means of firm ligaments at the diaphragm, at the \nanterior and posterior thoracic wall and at the region of the throat. As those fixations \nare ligaments they can be treated and influenced osteopathically (and to some extent \nI have treated them in regard of this study.)\n69 \n \nThose ligaments are: \n \n\u2022 Ligamentum phrenico-pericardiaca:  is linked to the tendinous centre \n\u2022 Ligamentum sterno-pericardiaca:  the sternopericardiac ligament superior goes \nfrom the manubrium of sternum to the anterior superior side of the \npericardium, the sternopericardiac ligament inferior: goes from the top of the \nxiphoid process to the anterior inferior side of the pericardium. \n\u2022 Ligamentum vertebro-pericardiaca:  goes from vertebral bodies from C7, Th1, \nTh2 and Th3 to the left side of the pericardium \n\u2022 Ligamentum cervico-pericardiaca:  is a prolongation of the visceral fascia of the \nthroat \n\u2022 Ligamentum viscero-pericardiaca:  connects the pericardium with the \nesophagus, the bifurcation of trachea and the pulmonary veins 70 \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n68 cf.

Ligner, B., (Thorax/ Lunge), s.p.  \n 263.2.3. The diaphragm \n \nThe midriff (diaphragm) is the main respiratory muscle.72 It performs about 20.000 \nmoves a day and in doing so incorporates lung and ventral organs every time.73 \n \nDuring inspiration (inhalation) a flattening of the vault of diaphragm takes place, \nhowever the tedinous centre stays in place.  When inspiration is more forceful the \nperipheral muscular parts of the midriff lift from the lateral chest wall by means of \ncontraction. Thus the costodiaphragmatic recess dilates and the lung moves into it. \nMoreover the tedinous centre moves a little bit downwards. Consequently out of its \nmove the diaphragm changes the volume of the chest and of the abdominal cavity. \nThe midriff is a muscular dome-shaped partition wall and emanates from the lower \nchest aperture at the lumbar spine, from the ribs and the sternum. According to these \nparts you distinguish between a lumbar part, a costal part and a sternal part.74 \n \nWorth mentioning are the apertures in the diaphragm for the aorta (aortic hiatus), an \naperture for the vena cava and an aperture for the gullet (esophageal hiatus). \nThrough the aperture last mentioned is not only passing the gullet but also the \nanterior and posterior vagal trunk (they contain fibres of the left and right vagus \nnerve).75 \n \nThe midriff is associated with lots of structures of the musculoskeletal system. It has \ngot connections to the lumbar spine, the six lower ribs, the xiphoid process of the \nsternum and because of myofascial connections  to the lower extremities, the psoas \nmuscle and the quadratus lumborum muscle.76  \n \n3.2.4. The auxiliary respiratory muscles \n \nThe function of the auxiliary respiratory muscle during still inhalation is still contended \nbut they do in fact act while laboured inspiration.77 As a sung tone accomplishes only \nunder laboured inspiration, the auxiliary respiratory muscles are described in the \nfollowing text. \n \nThis includes the sternocleidomastoideus muscle (the \u201chead turner\u201d). At one-sided \naction of this muscle the face is turned to the opposite side and the chin is lifted. At \nmutual actionthe occiput is drawn to caudal and the chin is lifted. But if head and \nthroat are fixed it supports the inhalation by lifting the chest in collaboration with the \nrest of the throat and neck muscles.78 \n \nIn the same way the saclenus group is counted among the auxiliary respiratory \nmuscles. Here you distinguish between the scalenus anterior, medius and posterior \nmuscle. (It is also important to mention the rear and the front scalenus gap which lie \nbetween the muscles, as in the rear scalenus gap the subclavian artery and the \n                                            \n72 cf. Waldeyer, A. / Mayet, A., (Anatomie 1), p. 198. \n73 cf. Barall, (Barall-1), p. 3. \n74 cf. Waldeyer, A. / Mayet, A., (Anatomie 1), p. 198. \n75 cf. ibid., p. 201. \n76 cf. Greenman, p. 27. \n77 cf. Waldeyer, A. / Mayet, A., (Anatomie 2), p. 82. \n78 cf. ibid., p. 77.  27brachial plexus cross and in the front one the sublavian vein crosses). The effect of \nthe scalenus group is very multifunctional. They lift the ribs but they also can bend \nthe cervical spine if the ribs are fixed. When the cervical spine is fixed and there is \nstrained inspiration they work as auxiliary respiratory muscles.79 \n \nAlso mentionable are the intercostal muscles that belong to the muscles of the chest. \nThey also act like respiratory muscles whereby the external intercostal muscles and \nthe intercartilaginei muscles lift the ribs and so extend the chest \u2013 consequently they \nare inspirators. (The internal intercostal muscles and the transversus thoracis muscle \nlower the ribs and consequently they are exspirators.)80 \n \n \n3.3. Respiration from an anatomic and a functional point of view \n \u201c\u00dcberall auf dem ganzen Erdball umgibt uns Luft. Vom Anfang bis zum Ende unseres Lebens, vom ersten bis zum letzten Tage nehmen wir Luft ein. Ohne dieselbe \nk\u00f6nnen wir nicht leben. Speise und Trank nehmen wir nur einige Male t\u00e4glich zu uns, \naber Luft atmen wir ungef\u00e4hr 15-20 Mal in der Minute, also etwa 1.200 Mal in einer \nStunde.\u201d\n81 \n[\u201dEverywhere, on the whole world there is air. From the beginning until the end of our \nlife, from the first to the last day we breath. Without the same we could not life. Food \nand drink we ingest only a few times a day but we breath about 15-20 times in and \nout in one minute, that means 1.200 times a day.\u201d ] \n \nRespiration is the only function of the metabolism that works permanently \nautonomously, but can also be controlled deliberately. From this it follows that we \ncan use our respiration actively to support our health. Respiration is also a mirror for \nour soul because it shows our base emotions.82 \n \nThe inhalation (inspiration) is an active process which is induced by the diaphragm \nand the external intercostal muscles. The midriff lowers its cupolas \u2013 thereby the \nintrathoracic volume enlarges. Furthermo re an enhancement of the chest accrues \nbecause of the uplift of the sternum and the costal arches and the erecting of the \nthoracic spine. As there is negative pressure in the pleural cavity the lungs follow the \nmoves of the thorax. From this a lung volume enlargement results that leads to a \nnegative pressure in the lung so that air streams in. \n \nAt increased inspiration the auxiliary respiratory muscles come into effect. The \ninfrahyoid muscles and the sternocleidomastoideus muscle lift the chest provided \nthat the head and cervical spine are fixed by means of extensors.  \n \nThe shoulder girdle is lifted by the rhomboideus muscle, levator scapulae and the \ntrapezius muscle and so relieves the thorax of his exspiratorical burden. The \nextensors of the thoracic spine support inspiration because the uplift of the ribs is \nconnected to the strechting.83 \n                                            \n79 cf. Waldeyer, A. / Mayet, A., (Anatomie 2), p. 81 ff. \n80 cf. ibid., p. 545 ff. \n81 cf. Platen, M., (Platen), p. 68 \n82 cf. Ehrmann, W., (Atemtherapie), p. 11 \n83 cf. Waldeyer, A. / Mayet, A., (Anatomie 2), p. 551   28 \nThe event of expiration  accrues because of the elastic reset forces of the ribs, the \nlung and the mediastinum. This process is passive.  \n \nRequirement for an efficient respiration is an elastic thorax with a surrounding tissue \nfree of tension.84 \n \n3.4. The Tone \n \nA tone  begins in the larynx because of the fast swinging of the vocal cords. This \nswinging are lead by the expiration air and the muscle tone. Those vibrations are \nforwarded by bones \u2013 the surrounding body space resonates. When the body space \nresonates, triggered by fine vibrations, you talk about a resonating cavity \u2013 so the \ntone develops into a sound.85 \n \nThe own voice is mainly transported by means of bones, that is why you hear \nyourself mainly from within. Foreign voices are brought to our eardrum trough the air \nby sound waves.86 Resonating cavities that are set in swinging during phonation are \ninternal body spaces. Respiration movement and resonance vibration can be located \nin the same body region.87 \n \nNot trained healthy voices show a vocal range of about two octaves. Trained singers \nreach three to four and a half octaves.88 \n \nHigh tones  \n \nFor high tones the freedom of the head sound is determining and therewith the \npassage from the throat to the back of the head since it is the largest bulge of a bone \nin the head and enables a sonority. The rear pharynx space and the oral cavity take \npart in the production of warm tones. They influence singing and speaking voice. \n \nThe head can be divided in a middle level \u2013 this consists of the upper jaw, the upper \nalignment, the zygomatic bones, the temples and the hard palate. This middle level is \nassociated with a bright, broad, light and open sound quality. An \u201cinner smile\u201d would \nhelp to make this middle level sound because this widens the cavity of the head. If \nthat happens the lower jaw can participate less,  stay loose, so that a fingerbreadth \ndistance occurs between the upper and lower alignment at the vowels \u201ce\u201d and \u201ci\u201d. \n \nFurthermore there is the nasal sound space which consists of the nasal bone and the \nfrontal bone. The soft palate is lifted at the same time. This sound is mainly used in \nspiritual music and in French language. If all facial bones sound you call it \u201cmask\u201d. It \nhas a dazzling effect and is carried outwards far. \n \nYou have reached your highest tone when the skullcap, the frontal bone, the hard \npalpate and the whole upper head space is brought into resonance vibration. When \n                                            \n84 cf. Osteopathie bei PatientInnen mit funktioneller Dysphonie, p. 37 \n85 cf. H\u00f6ller-Zangenfeind, M., (Stimme), p. 74 \n86 cf. ibid., p. 75 \n87 cf. ibid., p. 77 \n88 cf. Kittel, G., (Phoniatrie), p. 21 f.  29the skullcap swings the acoustic noise spreads over the ceiling, the dome and the \nwindows.89 \n \nDeep tones  \n \nThe shoulder girdle, the costal arches, the spine and the pelvic bone \u2013 the big bones \nof the body \u2013 create space for deep tones  and audible physicalness. These bones \nform the big visceral cavity. The front is apperceived more than the side walls or the \nback side so the bones at the back are rarely used for sound. Therefore it is useful to \ntrain loosening exercises for the back and the flanks as preparation for a deep sound \nspace. When the trunk sounds this leads to an acoustical rather horizontal \ndispersion. The sound waves are lead by the air and can touch a dialog partner. This \nmight be the secret of an appealing voice.90  \n \nBreaking tones  \n \nIt often happens to untrained singers that there is a break when they change from \nchest resonance to head resonance. You hear a shifting in the gorge. In singing \nthose breaks are called \u201cregister breaks\u201d.91 \nA voice register is a row of sequent tones that are built after a similar physiological \nprincipal. The chest (plain-) register develops because of the swinging of the vocal \ncords in their full width with vibration perceptions in the chest area. In the head \nregister with the perceived vibrations in the head area (head voice) the vocal cords \njust swing in the area near the verge \u2013 that is why it is often called \u201cverge register\u201d. \n \nIt is not sure whether a middle register (transition register) is existing or not.92 It is \nalso called mixed register (mixed voice). This  register contains the speaking voice in \nwhich sounds of the head resonance and the chest resonance are mixed up. \nAnatomical this is the region from the upper chest up to the nasal cavity. When you \nsing in middle voice the whole breadth of the vocal is cords is utilised.93 \n \nThe middle voice of women amounts 196-262 Hz, the middle voice of men amounts \n98-131 Hz. Literature quotes extreme values in the singing voice going from 43 up to \n3200 Hz.94 \n \nThe volume of the voice is dictated by the subglottic pressure. While normally \nspeaking there is a volume of about 70-80 db. Recorded peak values lies 110-120 \ndb.  A dynamic latitude of about 27 db is the normal range for a qualified adult \nvoice.95  \n \nThe maximum phonation time of the tone is determined by the vital capacity, the \nphonation volume and the average flow velocity and the phonatoric efficiency factor. \nOn average the length of the tone held amounts to 22.5 sec with women and 30.3 \nsec with men. Singers achieve a considerably higher value. 96 \n                                            \n89 cf. Kittel, G., (Phonaitrie), p. 87 ff. \n90 cf.

Influence on the human voice \n \nA major factor for the influence on the human voice is respiration. You can train \nbreathing actively and improve it. As the osteopathic concept is compared partly to \nthe respiratory therapeutic concept in this thesis it is worth mentioning that \nrespiratory therapy, which consists of an active and a passive part, can advance the \nability to breath \u201cwell\u201d. Further information concerning this under point 4 \u2013 respiratory \ntherapeutic concept.97 \n \nThere are many different opinions about the \u201cright breathing\u201d \u2013 for example \nabdominal breathing is good \u2013 high breath is bad and to breath slowly is better than \nto breath fast, you also should breath in deeply and breath out forcefully and so on. \nBut it would be best to forget all those adv ices. What we know today about the event \nof breathing is that it is individual for every person and that it is influenced a lot by \nevery feeling. \nIt starts with the fact that the respiration changes if you perform a task and that it \nvaries if this task bores or fulfils. Therefore you cannot decide whether the happening \nis \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d or sort it in \u201cdrawers\u201d.98 \n \nAs it are the affects (emotions like laughter, sob, yawn and so an) which are \n\u201cconveyed\u201d by the diaphragm to the vocalisation organ, singer stimulate their \nvocalisation organ with artificially created affects (which do not exactly align with \nwhat should be displayed).99 \n \n\u201cDie Leistung f\u00fcr einen langen Ausatem \u2013 sei es f\u00fcr einen Ton oder f\u00fcr eine Melodie, \nmuss mit der Skelettmuskulatur bew\u00e4ltigt werden. Die Muskeln gehorchen dem \nWillen. Sie nehmen seinen Befehl, mehr zu leisten oder loszulassen entgegen und \nsetzten ihn um. Diese Leistung wirkt indirekt auf einen langen Ton und direkt auf \neinen beschleunigten Einatemreflex\u201d.100 \n \n[\u201cThe attainment for long exhalation \u2013 be it for a tone or a melody, has to be coped by \nthe skeletal muscles. Muscles obey the will. They receive its orders to accomplish \nmore or to release and they implement it. This attainment affects a long tone \nindirectly and the accelerated inhalation reflex directly.\u201d ] \n \n \nWorking on the respiration \u2013 independent from the concrete form affects on: \n \n\u2022 the body, in the sense of an ideal muscle tonus, an improved propulsion, an \nideal posture \n \n\u2022 the soul as the patient learns do distinguish between external and own \npowers, to improve his/her ability to form relationships by admission, adapting \n                                            \n97  cf. p. 31 of this paper \n98  cf. H\u00f6ller-Zangenfeind, M., (Stimme), p. 29 and Middendorf, I., (Atemtherapie), p. 2 \n99  cf. Husler, F. / Rodd-Marling, Y., (Singen), p. 55. \n100 cf. ibid., p. 43.  31and resisting (even if the result is that the wish arises to be just someone \ndifferent) \n \n\u2022 the sound: improvement in sound concerning the length of the tone, the \nstrength of the tone, optimisation of the inhaling reflex, support for high tones, \nthe breathing and a freer interpretation.101 \n \nThis thesis proves that an osteopathic  treatment has an influence on the human \nvoice \u2013 consequently also on respiration. All structures that are responsible for a \nwell-functioning respiration and a good voice, are the anatomic structures cited under \npoint 3.1. 102 \n \n \n4. Influence of the respirator y therapeutic co ncept on the \nhuman voice \n \n\u201eSind wir ein Spiel von jedem Druck der Luft?\u201c103  \nGoethe \n \nAlready in the womb the respiratory technique is developed systematically. \nConcerning the outer form of the breas t these developing processes take place \nduring the second foetal month. \n \nAs breath accompanies all people throughout their whole life, is it then not important to optimise it? Respiratory therapy is one way of making us aware of our breath.\n104 \n \nSpeaking in an uneconomic way often causes vegetative dysfunctions. Deficiency in \nconcentration, nerviness, lassitude and sometimes even dysfunctions of the \ncirculatory regulations may be the consequences.105 Speaking in an economic way, \nhowever, is characterised by a vocal effici ency without a waste of power, as well as \nby an optimum supply and usage of breath, which shows how much working on one\u2019s \nbreath influences the human voice. 106 \n \n4.1. Definition of the respiratory therapeutic concept according to \nMiddendorf \n \nAs the respiratory therapeutic concept is a very extensive one it goes far beyond \ninfluencing biological breath or improving people\u2019s voices. It is a holistic concept that \nis based on the theory of Ilse Middendorf concerning an experiencable breath and \nthe work with the consciously admitted breath. This theory describes a so called \nsomatic therapy \u2013 method where physical and mental well-being is raised by means \nof practising simple motion sequences as  well as by means of a conscious \npercipience of the respiratory movements. It is not predominantly a matter of \n                                            \n101 cf. H\u00f6ller-Zangenfeind, M., (Stimme), p. 72. \n102 cf. p. 19 of this paper. \n103 cf. Schmitt, J., (Atemheilkunst), Einf\u00fchrung. \n104 cf. ibid., p.11. \n105 cf. Coblenzer, H./ Muhar, F., (Atem und Stimme), p. 20. \n106 cf. ibid., p.11.   32improving physiological breathing, although this is often achieved by such a \ntreatment- it is more a matter of apperceiving one\u2019s unconscious respiration and thus \npermit it.  \nNevertheless the knowledge of the physiologic-anatomic background of respiration is \na necessary prerequisite for every respiratory therapist.107 \nAim of the respiratory therapy is a \u2018eutonic state\u2019, which is characterised by the \nfollowing features: a good muscle tone, an optimum joint flexibility, the permeability of \nthe body for the respiratory movements, a well-balanced mental alertness.108 \n \n4.2. The mode of action of the respiratory therapeutic concept \n \nThe respiratory therapist attends to and supports the patient \u2013 a permanent \nexchange between patient and therapist happens. It is very important not to convey \nan \u2018ideal of breathing  to the patient but that the therapy is borne by what the patient \n\u2018reveals\u2019.109 \n \nThe respiratory therapy is based on the following basic principles: \n \n\u2022 Only the patient is able to judge how harmonious a certain movement feels for \nhim at that moment- ergo there are no \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 movements.  \n \n\u2022 The patient builds up an inner attentiveness, by which even minimal physical, \nemotional and mental processes are noticed. \n \n\u2022 It is aimed at eutonic movements- movements which are performed in adequate \nmyotonus. \n \n\u2022 A fundamental feeling of being stabilized, held and borne is conveyed.  \n \n\u2022 Respiration is not manipulated or forced. The respiratory movement happens, is \nbeing admitted and apperceived.110 \n \n \nFor achieving the objectives of a consciously admitted respiration according to \nMiddendorf 111 the following techniques are used: \n \n4.2.1. Stretching and pressure \n \nBy stretching specific groups of muscles or whole body regions during the inhalation \nand exhalation phase breath is being animated and deepened. \nOn working with pressure points the correlation of pressure points and respiratory \nmovements is being used in certain body spaces in order to influence respiration.112 \n                                            \n107 cf. Fischer, K., Kemann- Huber E., (bewusster Atem), p. 9 f. \n108 cf. ibid., p.12. \n109 cf. ibid., p.19. \n110 cf. Fischer, K., Kemann- Huber E., (bewusster Atem), p. 57 ff. \n111 on the operating principles based on Middendorf cf. Fischer, K., Kemann- Huber E., (bewusster    \nAtem), p. 105 ff.  \n112 cf. Fischer, K., Kemann- Huber E., (bewusster Atem), p.105 ff.  33 \n4.2.2. Motion sequences applied \n \nBy means of consciously, i.e. deliberately applied motion sequences breath is being \nanimated and made obvious and consequently the individual respiratory rhythm can \nbe experienced. A distinction is made between smooth motion sequences where the \nmovement rhythm is being dictated by work and where breath keeps its own rhythm \nand smooth motion sequences where the rhythm of the outer movements is dictated \nby the respiratory rhythm. Stretching moti on sequences serve the spatial sensation \nand the formation of respiratory scopes, and rhythmic motion sequences help to \nmake somebody aware of their exhalation movement and to strengthen it.113 \n \n4.2.3. Movement from respiration \n \nForm, quality, mode and intensity of the movement arises from breath whereby the \nconsciously admitted respiratory movement activates the inner movement.114 \n \n4.2.4. Work on breath related tension phenomena \n \nWork on breath related tension phenomena is about experiencing inhalation- as well \nas exhalation \u2013 tension. It is based on an interaction of contraction and expansion, of \ndirectedness and softness as a bodily equivalence of mental energies.115 \n \n4.2.5. Vowel space work and work on consonants \n \nThe work on vowels builds respiratory space in a specific way. Each vowel \ncorresponds to a certain respiratory space with its own characteristic experiential and \nsensational qualities. With the help of consonants it is possible to release the \ndiaphragm and work on the inner mobility. Consonants have the character of strokes, \ncenterings, impulsions, conjunctions and loosenings in the entirety of the body walls. \nBy means of both works the impulsive quality of breath as well as the compression \nand centering is being experienced.116 \n \n4.2.6. Work on vocal expression  \n \nThe physical preconditions for the development of the creative potential of the voice \nare being laid. Vowel space work and cons onant work are being extended by a work \non breath, tone, tone tension and resonanc e. Hereby sensations, feelings and \nthoughts are expressed just as possibilities and potentials available. 117 \n \n                                            \n113 cf. Fischer, K., Kemann- Huber E., (bewusster Atem), p. 114 ff. \n114 cf ibid., p. 122 ff. \n115 cf. Fischer, K., Kemann- Huber E., (bewusster Atem), p. 130. \n116 cf. ibid., p. 136 ff.  \n117 cf. ibid., p. 140 ff.  344.2.7. Tinting from breath \n \nBy tinting the patient produces whatev er breath releases at that moment.118 \n \n \n4.3. Respiratory massage according to Schmitt \n \nSchmitt119 distinguishes between the following techniques of the respiratory art of \nhealing:  \n \n4.3.1. Passive treatment: Respiratory massage \n During back treatment\n the movability of the complete thoracic vertebral column is \ntested and the intermediate vertebra as well as  the vertebral joints are being loosed \nby means of flexible pressure from the bottom up.  \n \nSchmitt describes the existence of muscular indurations, muscle hardenings and myogelotic changes of the musculature. He states that myogelosis and their earlier \nstages can be localised in a regular way at the insertion area of muscles.\n120 These \nmyogelotic changes are released by differ ent massage techniques. There is also an \ninfluence on the different reflex zones of gall and liver and via the headgen zones on \nthe lungs and the diaphragm.   \nThe pelvis treatment\n is the treatment of the area of the bellies, origins and insertions \nof the long back extensor between chest and pelvis, the cross and transverse \nabdominal muscle groups and in the insertion area of the gluteal muscles.121 \n \nDuring the shoulder treatment  the therapist massages the origins of the rhomboid \nand scapula muscles, as well as the lower scapula angle. There is an intersection \nwith the maximal points of the heart reflex zone here.  Also the serratus lateral \nmuscle. \n \nDuring the treatment of the anterior trunk  both chest muscles are being massaged, \nthe diaphragm tone is being altered by compression and the abdominal muscles are \nbeing treated. The pelvic floor is stretched in supine position and the \u201cflanks\u201d in a \nlateral position. \n \nThe neck treatment  conduces to the loosening and in \u2013 depth massage of the \ntrapezius muscle. The therapist follows the tensions up to the upper vertebra of the \nneck. By means of this technique a stretching of the whole tissue via the distension \nof the cervical spine originating at the back of the head is achieved.122 \n \n                                            \n118 cf. Fischer, K., Kemann- Huber E., (bewusster Atem), p. 148 ff. \n119 cf. Schmitt, J., (Atemheilkunst), p. 462 ff. \n120 cf. Ibid., p. 462 ff. \n121 cf. ibid., p. 473 ff. \n122 cf. Schmitt, J., (Atemheilkunst), p.499ff.  354.3.2. Active treatment  \n \nThe active respiratory gymnastics  is the counterpart of the passive respiratory \nmassage- consisting of yoga exercises wher e breath is considered the central device \nfor the advancement of concentration, imme rsion and the development of mental and \nspiritual abilities.123  \n \nSeveral different side treatments  concerning alimentation, climate treatment, \nacupuncture etc. complement the treatments mentioned above.  \n \n \n4.4.  Respiratory therapy/Respiratory treatment- what is that? \n \nBecause I treated several singers and all of them reported about a clear \nimprovement of their voices, Dr. Lisa Malin124 gave me the idea to document these \nrealisations by means of a study. It was in her interest to have a comparison group, \nwhich should be treated by means of respiratory therapy, too. Malin wanted to treat \nthem herself. Because I did not know which respiratory therapeutic techniques she \nwas going to use, I decided to ask her about these techniques in an interview.125 \n \nAccording to Malin, 2006 the experience and the development of one\u2019s own breath \nare central to the respiratory therapy. Becoming aware of one\u2019s own respiratory \nrhythm offers the opportunity for an encounter with oneself. The respiratory \nmovement (inhalation, possibly respiratory break) can bring into flow again states of \ntension (such as stress, physical tense ness, exertion resulting from depressing \nexperiences) that are obstructive to the respiratory development. \n \nBy body-related stretching, pressure and impulses respiration is strengthened in such \na way that body regions and perception areas are re-connected and via experience \nbrought back into the consciousness. Breath is accompanied by the hands and goes \ninto the development of the respiratory spaces. A loosening benefits the muscle tone \nand aids the straightening. Via a developed respiratory force we experience breath \nsubstance, which makes a body -mind connection transparent.  \n \nWherever the muscular plating/blockade in the front and back area of the lungs \nobstructs breathing in and out- and thus the respiratory movements- purging and \ncleansing cannot happen sufficiently. If a long lasting blockade is released \u2013 e.g. by \nmeans of releasing and activating the ar ea of the intercostal musculature- the \npurging process starts increasingly and thus mucus formation increases in the same \nway. By means of actively accompanying breath with the hands, i.e. of the respiratory \nmovement into the respiratory spaces and therefore also into the flanks, all of the \nparts of the lungs (including vacuoles and vesicles where oxygen is replaced by \nblood) develop greater activity.  \n \n                                            \n123  cf. Schmitt, J., (Atemheilkunst), p.511 f. \n124  Dr. Malin is a trained respiratory therapist und teaches breath- and body-training at the University \nof Music, Vienna as well as music therapy and formation of new energetic models and methods at the  Gamed- Academy for integrative medicine.  \n125 A detailed rendition of the interview is to be found in the appendix of this paper, cf. p. 88f.   36Respiratory treatment was chosen for the study because it is suitable better for \ncomparing it to the osteopathic treatment than active respiratory techniques, although \nrespiratory treatment structurally differs from the osteopathic treatment. Respiratory \ntherapy enables us to at best see the actual state of the respiratory volume, the \nrespiratory rhythm, the bodily penetrability and how the respiratory movement \nstreams through the body, i.e. which parts of the body are connected.  Not only the \nactual state becomes evident, but also the mutability, which is not enforced from the \noutside but shows how the body can admit the next step due to a process of \nunderstanding and allowing.  \n \nThe hands of the therapist may accompany, assist and sometimes demand but they \nshall not ask too much of the patient. The whole process must be accompanied by a \nconscious observation of and feeling for breath and body.  \nDrifting away into a dream world is inappropriate here. \n \nBy concentrating on this breath-body process- to let loose and integrate something \nnew- the tension desired for singing can be reduced temporarily. This means that an \nactive transition must be created or enough time must be allowed that the new things \nbecome integrated and connected and thus th e tension desired is established again. \n \nDuring the lessons there are active exercises, which means that students never \nreach a state of such a deep relaxation as  they do when being (respiratory) treated. \nThus during everyday exercises small steps are admitted again and again. A senior \nstudent told me that, whenever she had a singing lesson after the respiratory training, \nshe did not have to warm up- only on one occasion, when a deep relaxation was \nnecessary, she had to work on the relaxation of the back so that the respiratory \nmovement could stream through a greater part of the spinal column. This means she \nhad to dissipate an \u2018everyday tension\u2019 in order to reach an active permeability. In this \ncase the student needed several hours to build up the tension necessary for the day.  \n \nMiddendorf and Richter126 let, according to their work (active exercising), begin with \nunhearable tones and then start with phonation that is not enforced, especially not \nconcerning the volume, but created from the inside. Escribano, who starts with a \nchildlike slurring with a loosed tongue and then adds the voice, takes in articulation \nlater on. As the experience and the consciousness of the breath are being trained, \nwe include the person. The body has to be connected to the person, which means to \nthe personality and one\u2019s own character. When respiratory resources/ respiratory \nspaces, permeability etc. are active, more active qualities are available to this \nperson.  \n \nDuring the respiratory treatment body and respiratory event are worked on for 40 \nminutes. Afterwards there is a rest of fi ve minutes. Generally spoken after about 30 \nminutes a new development in the patient shows, which means there are still 10 \nminutes left for an active integration and then there is the five \u2013 minutes rest in which \none should feel again what happened/changed.127 \n \n \n                                            \n126 cf. Richter, H., (Atemwelten), p.9ff. \n127 cf. Interview with Dr. Lisa Malin in the appendix of this paper (p. 88 f).  374.5. Respiratory treatment for the study \u2018singing\u2019 \n \nMalin (2006) describes the process of the respiratory therapeutic treatments she \nconducted for the study as follows:  \n \nDuring the treatment the test persons are lying either in prone or in supine position- \nwhereby they may decide themselves on the chronological order. The therapist tests \nthe quality of the breath. The respiratory work begins wherever there is strength in \nthe body and where breath flows at best. From there the therapist proceeds to other \nparts - always staying connected to the patient\u2019s breath.   \n \nMostly the hands of the therapist accompany the breath through many parts of the \nbody- he/she feels how attendant the patient is in his/her body and thereby \nconnected to his/her own breath \u2013 and how t he different parts of the body are being \nflowed through by breath.    \n \nThen the therapist concentrates more on the blockades, if they are ready for being \nreleased yet. At releasing the blockades stretching, pressure and movement of e.g. \narms, legs and head are used. Thereby breath can develop, a true breathing in \nbecomes possible \u2013 \u2018a way is opened up\u2019, or a releasing and calm breathing out \nappears. Breath can also arise in form of a developed prolongated expiration and a \nreflectory inspiration. The aim of the respiratory work is, however, not to release \nblockades but the development of tension, easiness, space, dedication, flow of \nenergy etc.  \n \n5. Comparison: osteopathic concept \u2013 respiratory \ntherapeuti c concept \n  \nBasically a philosophical aspect which puts the unity of body, spirit and soul and their \ninteraction in the centre of consideration underlies both concepts. \n \nThe philosophy of respiration therapy is illustrated by the following quotes: \n\u201cAtmend erleben wir uns unmittelbar als K\u00f6rper-Geist-Einheit. Ich atme also bin ich \u2013 \ndiese Gewissheit liegt unserem Leben zugrunde und tr\u00e4gt es. Was zuerst gelehrt \nwerden muss, ist der Atem \u2013 so spricht Kung-fu-tse.\u201d128 \n[\u201cbreathing we directly experience ourselves as unit of body and spirit. I breathe, \ntherefore I am \u2013 this certainness underlies our live and carries it. What has to be \ntaught first is breathing \u2013 so Kung-fu-tse says.\u201d ] \n \n\u201cWir lassen unseren Atem kommen, wir lassen ihn gehen und warten, bis er von \nselbst wiederkommt. Eine willentlich eingesetzte Atembewegung hat jedoch nicht die \nhohe Qualit\u00e4t wie jene, die von selbst aus K\u00f6rper/ Seele/ Geist als Ganzem quillt.\u201d129 \n[\u201dWe let our breath come, we let it go and wait, until it comes back on its own. \nHowever, a deliberately inserted respiration movement has not such a high quality as \nthe breath movement that swells of its own accord out of body/ soul/ spirit.\u201d ] \n \n                                            \n128 cf. Ehrmann, W., (Atemtherapie), p. 22. \n129 cf. Middendorf, I., (Atemlehre), p. 19.  38The concept of osteopathy described by Still: \n\u201c\u2026No man or woman can tell you what it means more than to say that it is a system \nof engineering the whole machinery of life harmoniously by keeping open all the \ncommunications with the brain and overcoming all stoppages of blood from the heart, \nand other fluids. Sensation, motion and nutriti on must all work at once, no minus or \nplus can exist in health, any more than four can go into three twice. With all parts in \ntheir normal condition, health is yours.\u201d130 \n\u201cDer menschliche Organismus tr\u00e4gt in sich das Potential der Gesundheit. Wer dieses \nPotential erkennt und unterst\u00fctzt kann Krankheiten verhindern und heilen.\u201d131 \n[\u201dThe human organism contains in itself the potential of health. Whoever realises and \nsupports this potential can prevent and cure diseases.\u201d ] \n \nBoth respiratory therapy and osteopathy work according to the \u201cholistic\u201d rudiment by \nbringing the person into a condition in which he or she can command resources \nbetter and self healing mechanisms are activated. However, osteopathy, different \nfrom respiration therapy, pursues a direct or indirect \u201cproblem solution\u201d by diagnosing \na problem osteopathically after the anamnesis and the examination. This problem is \ntreated either directly or indirectly by influencing the original structure.132 If the body \nis affected by blockades and the motionlessness, disturbance of density and \nstructure or consistence involved, it can lead to mechanical or physiological \ndisorders. The correction of those disorders is the aim of the osteopathic treatment in \nterms of the principle \u201clife is movement\u201d133. \n \nProblem solution in the proper meaning of the word is not the target of respiration \ntherapy (but often the initial point). The dire ct aim is the \u201cexperience of the conscious \nbreathing\u201d and the consequent holistic improv ement. On the basis of this experiences \nthe choice of techniques and the progress of therapy is decided.134 \n \nIn osteopathy respiration and voice are highly rated but are not the centre of \nattention. \n \nIn respiration therapy it is assumed that the respiration movement is transmitted all \nover the whole body. That means that this respiration movement is actually \nnoticeable.135 This concept resembles the universal osteopathic concept of \nrespiration and circulation. Every organ is influenced by breathing since every cell \ndepends on the supply with oxygen, gl ucose and other substances that are \nnecessary for their metabolism.136 \n \nThe respiratory therapeutic concept, referred to the respiratory massage, has a \nregulated procedure of treatment always according to the same schema. The \ntechniques used here are nearly identical to many other structural osteopathic \ntechniques. An example therefore is the concrete treatment of myogelosis and the \ninfluence by means of trigger points and dermatomes. \n \n                                            \n130 cf. Still, A., (Still), p. 57. \n131 cf. Still in Liem, T. / Tsolodimos, C., (Osteopathie), p. 60. \n132 cf. Liem, T., Tsolodimos, C., (Osteopathie), p. 69 and Greenman, P., (Greenman), p. 24. \n133 cf. Ligner, B., (Thorax/Lunge), p. 1. \n134 cf. Fischer, K., Kemann-Huber, E., (bewusster Atem), p. 9 ff. \n135 cf. H\u00f6ller-Zangenfeind, M., (Stimme), p. 29.  \n136 cf. Greenman, p. 26.  39In osteopathic treatment there is no schema that is the same at every care and there \nare no global requirements, which techniques or which combinations of techniques \nshould be used at which disorders.137 Aim of the osteopathic treatment is the search \nfor the main lesion and its treatment. At this the osteopath can use the techniques \ndescribed in this thesis under point 1.2. et seq. That means it is possible that a \npatient is treated in one session only cranio-sacrale, in another primary visceral and \nstructural \u2013 a treatment with the technique which has the most efficient consequence \nat this moment. The detection of the appropriate technique is subjected to the \nexperience of the osteopath.138 \n \nOf course, the respiratory massage according to Schmitt is only a section of \nrespiration therapy \u2013 as well as structural osteopathy is also just a partition of an \nosteopathic treatment. All active treatment techniques \u2013 named \u201cbreathing \ngymnastics\u201d by Schmitt139 \u2013 can not be compared to an osteopathic treatment as it is \na purely passive treatment technique. This fact does not mean that those exercises \ncannot be recommended.   \n \n6. Methodology of the \u2018Study singing\u2019 \n While talking about the development of the \u2018study singing\u2019 we- that means Prof. \nClaudia Visca, Dr. Lisa Malin and I- came to the realization that a number of 40 test \npersons would be realistic for this study (because of the temporal investment for the \nstudents).  \n \nNumber of test persons planned: 40, actual number: 14, 13 tested, one case of \nillness. \n \nThe fact that in the end only 14 test persons were tested developed from the \nremarkable temporal investment the students had to make and from the \ncircumstance that being looked over by the \u2018critical eye\u2019 of a singing professor and \ntwo observers during the test poses a great challenge. And last but not least because \nof the comparison to colleagues that was inevitable during the study. Nevertheless it \nis worth mentioning, that the University of Music breeds about 140 students a year, \nwhich means that around 10% of the students of one year participated in the study.  \n \nTo conduct the study the students were divided into two groups. These groups were \nmy group \u2018Hempel\u2019 and the group \u2018Dr. Malin\u2019. The voices of both groups were tested \nin the beginning by recording them by means of an audio engineering programme.  \nFor control purposes the tests of both groups were repeated on another day. \nAfterwards the group \u2018Hempel\u2019 was treated osteopathically by myself and then tested \na third time. The group \u2018Malin\u2019 was treated in terms of a respiratory treatment and \nthen tested a third time, too.  \n \nDuring all the tests a professor (Prof. Visca) of the University of Music, Vienna acted \nas an observer. She documented the process as well as the changes.  \n \n                                           \n \n137 cf. Liem, T.,  Tsolodimos, C., (Osteopathie), p. 71. \n138 cf. Barall, Lehrbuch der visceralen Osteopathie, Band 2, p. 1. \n139 cf. Schmitt, J.L., (Atemheilkunst), p. 461.  40The results of both groups were compared by means of the records of the audio \nengineering programme, as well as by means  of the documentation by Prof. Visca. \nFurthermore the students were asked to write their own personal feedback.  \n \nIt should be displayed that an osteopathic treatment influences the human voice.  \n \n \n6.1. Test persons \n \nThe choice of test persons took place according to the following inclusion and \nexclusion criteria. All singing students of the University of Music, Vienna (about 140 \nper year)140 served as the main unit. \n \n6.1.1. Selection criteria of the test persons \n Inclusion criteria\n for the test persons were the following: \n \n\u2022 All test persons are singing students of the University of Music, Vienna who have \nbeen studying voice since three years minimum.  \n \n\u2022 All test persons are between 20-30 years old. \n \n\u2022 Both, male and female students are being tested. \n \n \nThe following exclusion criteria  were applied:  \n \n\u2022 None of the test persons is under a current medical treatment concerning voice, \nsinging or respiration and under no current osteopathic treatment of any kind.   \n \n\u2022 None of the students suffers from airways- or phonation diseases.  \n \n \n\u2022 Test persons are neither smokers nor do they drink alcohol regularly.  \n \n\u2022 The test persons do not feel organically ill, neither at the time of the audio-\nengineering test nor at the time of the osteopathic treatment.  \n \n\u2022 The test persons do not take medication regularly.  \n Because of the specially requested inclusion criteria the selection of the test persons \nhappened via a so called \u2018nonprobability sampling\u2019- consequently nothing was left to \nchance.  \n \nStudents of the University of Music (department of solo singing) of Dr. Lisa Malin \nwere asked if they were interested in taking part in the present study. About 50 \n                                           \n \n140 cf. http://www3.mdw.ac.at/  (homepage of the University of Music).  41students were asked, 14 of which agreed. Because of a health-related dropping out \nwhich could not be replaced in the group \u2018Hempel\u2019, thirteen were actually tested.   \n \n6.2. Testing conditions for the study \n \nIn the following I would like to outline in detail the conditions under which the present \nstudy came into being. Explaining the practice should lead to the interpretation of the \ntests. \n \n6.2.1. Variables \n Within the scope of the \u2018study singing\u2019 some variables were used. The independent \nvariables (independent) describe the object of investigation, which is not influenced \nfurther in the course of the study. \nThe dependent variable (dependent), however, is that factor, that is influenced by the \nindependent variable in terms of the correlation of cause and effect.  \n \nWithin the scope of the \u201cstudy singing\u201d the following variables were used. \n \n6.2.1.1.  Independent \n \nThe independent variable of the \u2018study singing\u2019 is, in the group of osteopathy, the \nosteopathic treatment of the test persons; in the group of respiratory therapy it is the \nrespiratory therapeutic treatment. The osteopathic treatment, which is the basis of \nthis work, is not influenced any further in the course of the study and represents the \nexamined intervention for achieving an influe nce in terms of the working hypothesis \n(\u201ean osteopathic treatment does have an influence on the human voice\u201c). \n \nAfter carrying out a thorough osteopathic examination, an exact anamnesis and \ninspection each test person was treated individually in terms of the osteopathic \nholistic approach. This means that the situation of a \u2018normal\u2019 osteopathic treatment \nwas created instead of specifically treating the same structure (e.g. diaphragm or \ncervical fascia, to influence the voice) of each and every student.  \n \n6.2.1.2.  Dependent \n \nThe examined dependent variables were gathered on the one hand by means of \nrecording with the aid of an audio engineering programme and on the other hand by \nmeans of a written documentation of the sing ing professor (Prof. Visca) as well as by \nmeans of a feedback questionnaire filled in by the test persons.  \n \n \nThe following dependent variables were used:  \n \n\u2022 Singing of an arbitrary  note \n\u2022 Singing a triad on the vowels \u201ei\u201c, \u201eu\u201c and \u201ea\u201c   42\u2022 Maximum phonation of a tone \n\u2022 Written documentation of the music professor \n\u2022 Written feedback of the students by means of a feedback questionnaire \n\u2022 Result of the audio engineering programme \n \n6.2.1.3. Comparison group \n \nThe independent variable is defined by means of the so called \u2018comparison group\u2019. \nThe comparison group is the group that is not influenced by the independent variable \nand thus demarcates the effect of the independent variable on the influenced \ndependent variables against \u2018coincidences\u2019.  \nIn the \u2018study singing\u2019 the comparison group c onsists of those test persons that were  \nnot treated osteopathically but were treated in respect to respiratory techniques \nbefore the third test series. So the group \u2018Malin\u2019 represents the comparison group of \nthe present study.  \n \n6.2.1.4. Reliability and validity of measurements \n \nReliability and validity of measurements ar e necessary premises for the significance \nof a study.  \n \nReliability means the dependability of the measuring process and of the measuring \ndevice. The test has to be reproducible and must be consistent under the same or \nsimilar testing conditions.  \n \nValidity is the measure in which the chos en instrument measures what it should \nmeasure.  Validity defines the diagnostic significance of a test. \n \nFor the \u2018study singing\u2019 following dispos itions were made to achieve the highest \npossible reliability:   \n \n\u2022 Measurements always took place in the sa me room and on the very spot of this \nroom.  \n \n\u2022 The same audio engineering programme was always used in the same way at all \ntests  \n \n\u2022 A sound engineer, who ensured the functionality of the programme and who \nrecorded all trials in the same way,  attended all the tests \n \n\u2022 The three test series were identical (arbitrary note, traid, maximum phonation of a \ntone)- this was controlled by the singing professor who was present at the tests.  \n \nThe validity of the measurement instru ment was ensured by the inspection of a \nsound engineer.  \n  436.3. Conduct of the tests \n  \nBefore the treatment all of the 14 test persons underwent the same test twice. This \ntest was repeated in the same way after the osteopathic or the respiratory \ntherapeutic treatment, respectively in order to test the effects of the treatment on the \nresults.  \n \nThe test execution process was arranged as follows:  \n \n\u2022 The test person sings any arbitrary note- arbitrary in relation to tone pitch as in \nrelation to the tone itself.  \n \n\u2022 The test person sings a triad on the vowels \u2018i\u2019, \u2018u\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019 whereby Prof. Visca \ndecided that the pitch of the tone used by the student during the first test has \nto be used during the second and third test as well in order to guarantee the \ncomparability of the tests.  \n \n\u2022 Maximum phonation of a tone- the student decides on pitch and volume \nhimself/herself with the aim to hold the tone longest possible. The length of the \ntone is the only appraisal criterion.   \n \nThe test was recorded by means of an audio engineering programme in order to draw a graphic comparison between the results. Moreover Frau Prof. Visca attended \nthe tests to ensure their comparability and to document the results from her point of \nview. After the treatment and the subsequently conducted third test series all of the \nstudents wrote their own personal feedback.  \n \n6.3.1. Technical documentation \n \nAs mentioned above an audio engineering programme was used for the \ndocumentation of the tests. In order to make the course of investigations \ncomprehensible a short description of the programme follows:  \n \nRecording took place by means of a large- area capacitor microphone. Because of its \nfidelity of frequency and its high measuring sensitivity this microphone provides a \nhigh recording quality. For the remote power supply and the linear processing of the \nsignal a microphone amplifier was used.   \n \nRecording happened on the one hand via a DAT recorder and on the other hand, \nwith the aid of a sound card, via a PC. Recording happened digitally by means of a \n24 bit/ 96kHz transformation. Two recording media were used in order to guarantee \ndata security by means of such backup facilities.141 \n \n  \n                                            \n141 details on the process sequence cf. the process depiction in the appendix of this paper (p. 88ff).  44Figure 6- Description of the process of the test set-up for the recording \n \n \n \nThe recorded wave \u2013form data was \u2018translated\u2019 to graphs with the aid of a frequency-\nanalysis software, which depicts all frequencies rendered.  The x-axis shows the \nfrequency range that was sung (measuring unit Hz); the y-axis shows the volume \n(measuring unit dB). In that way the analysis of the triad that was sung is depicted.142 \n \nWith respect to the graphics I furthermore have to state the following: \n \nThe graphics show two curves. The blue curve is a compressed average curve of the \ntests before the treatment. The red curve shows the results of the third singing test \n(in each case after the treatment).  \n                                            \n142 cf. exemplary graph in the appendix of this paper. (p.88ff). \n 45 \nFigure 7- graphic interpretation of the audio engineering programme \n \n \nAlways the first tone of the triad was analysed- particularly in order to depict changes \nin the voice volume as well as in the purity of voice. In another graph the whole triad \nwas pictured in order to give a complete picture of the test series and to make it \ncomparable- here especially with regard to the voice volume.  \n \n\u2022 The change of volume of the fundamental tone and the corresponding overtones \n(e.g. more gauge at a frequency or a rounder curve display a fuller tone- in the range of the fundamental tone as well as in the range of the overtones)  \n \n\u2022 The sung tone pitch over the \u2019swing\u2019 of the curves in the corresponding frequency \nranges  \n \n \n6.3.2.

Feedback questionnaire \n \nAs the test persons were recorded by the audio engineering programme before as \nwell as after the osteopathic treatment, there are objectively measurable results \nconcerning a change of the voice.  For me it was especially interesting if the test \npersons experienced the same changes the audio engineering programme showed, \nimplying also the results of Prof. Visca.  \n \nIn the following I will literally cite the feedback of the students who were \nosteopathically treated.  \n \n1) A. female  \n \n\u201eIch empfand die Behandlung als sehr angenehm. W\u00e4hrend ich bei der Durchf\u00fchrung \ndes ersten Tests relativ nerv\u00f6s war \u2013 sei es durch meine zeitlich knappe Ankunft \nnach einer langen Fahrt von M\u00fcnchen nach Wien oder was mich beim Test erwarten \nsollte - , war nach der Behandlung genau das Gegenteil der Fall: Sie hatte einen sehr \nberuhigenden Einfluss auf mich. Einerseits habe ich mich sehr zentriert und \nentspannt gef\u00fchlt, sodass mich nichts mehr beunruhigen konnte, andererseits h\u00e4tte \n                                            \n148 Statement by the test person: \u2018I am lying more relaxed now.\u2019  54ich mich am liebsten schlafen gelegt \u2013 ich war also fast zu entspannt, um zu singen. \nVielleicht mag das auch daran liegen, dass mein K\u00f6rper sich st\u00e4ndig in einer \n\u00dcberspannung befindet und nicht gewohnt ist, entspannt zu sein? F\u00fcr mich selbst \nw\u00fcrde ich die passive bzw. mechanische Behandlung der Osteopathie anschlie\u00dfend \nmit einem aktiven Part (z.B. Einsingen oder \u00dcbungen f\u00fcr die Aktivit\u00e4t des K\u00f6rpers, \nAtmung etc.) verbinden, bevor ich mit dem Singen beginnen w\u00fcrde. Auf alle F\u00e4lle \nhalte ich die Osteopathie f\u00fcr eine gute Option, um die Basis f\u00fcr ein funktionierendes \nInstrument herzustellen.\u201c \n[I found the treatment very pleasant. While I was relatively nervous during the first \ntest- maybe because of my short arrival a fter the long journey from Munich to Vienna \nor because I did not know what would happen- after the treatment just the opposite \nwas the case: it had a very calming influence on me. On the one hand I felt very \ncentred and relaxed like nothing could unsettle me and on the other hand I would \nhave liked to go to sleep immediately- so I was nearly too relaxed to sing. Maybe that \nis because my body permanently is in a state of surge and is not used to being \nrelaxed? For myself I would combine the passive or mechanic osteopathic treatment \nwith an active part (e.g. warm-up before singing or exercises for the activity of the \nbody and breathing etc.) before singing. Howe ver, from my point of view osteopathy \nis a good option to establish a functioning instrument.] \n \n2) B. female  \n \n\u201eVor eineinhalb Jahren war ich schon einmal in osteopathischer Behandlung \ngewesen und meine letzte Sitzung lag ungef\u00e4hr ein Jahr zur\u00fcck. Ich freute mich \ndaher schon sehr auf den Termin, da kurz zuvor meine alten Spannungen am \nR\u00fccken und im Speziellen bei drei Wirbeln zur\u00fcckgekehrt waren. Ich hatte schon die \nganze Zeit versucht, meinen Spannungsgef\u00fchlen in diesem Bereich durch bestimmte \nYoga\u00fcbungen Abhilfe zu leisten, oder hatte meinen starken Bruder gebeten, mich \nwieder einzurenken, wusste und merkte aber, dass das nicht ausreichend war. \nIch beschrieb dem Osteopath also meine sensible Stelle und er best\u00e4tigte mir die \nVerspannung in dem Bereich. Auf 2 verschiedene Arten renkte er mir mit lautem \nKnacksen mein Wirbel wieder ein, was ich wirklich sehr genoss und worauf ich mich \nschon die ganze Zeit gefreut hatte. Endlich waren die l\u00e4stigen Spannungen weg. \nAnschlie\u00dfend legte ich mich hin und er legte seine H\u00e4nde unter meinen Kopf und die \nH\u00fcfte. Ich lag einfach nur ruhig da und genoss die Entspannung in meinem R\u00fccken, \ndas spannungsfreihe Liegen und die sanfte pulsierende W\u00e4rme in meinem K\u00f6rper. \nMit der Zeit lie\u00df ich immer mehr los, mir fielen immer mehr Stellen auf, die ich noch \nv\u00f6llig unn\u00f6tig unter Spannung hatte und ich entspannte auch diese Bereich. Nat\u00fcrlich \nstand ich kurz vor dem Einschlafen, als man mich sanft darauf hinwies, dass die Zeit \ngleich vorbei sei. Zufrieden setzte ich mich auf und bemerkte dabei eine kleine \nRestspannung in dem vorher behandelten Bereich des oberen R\u00fcckens. Noch  \neinmal renkte mich der Osteopath ein und als ich dann aufstand hatte ich ein \nwohliges Gef\u00fchl von W\u00e4rme, Schl\u00e4frigkeit und Entspannung.\u201c \n[One and a half years ago I was already under osteopathic treatment and my last \nsitting took place about a year before the test. Therefore I was looking forward to the \ntreatment as shortly before my old back tensions, especially in the region of three \nvertebrae, returned. I had already tried all the time to relief these feelings of tension \nby means of special yoga exercises or as ked my strong brother to adjust me but \nknew and felt that that was not enough. I described my sensitive parts to the \nosteopath and he attested the tension in this part of my body. In two different ways \nhe adjusted my vertebrae with a loud crack \u2013 what I really enjoyed as I was looking  55forward to that all the time. Finally these annoying tensions had gone. Afterwards I \nlied down and he placed his hands under my head and under my hips. I just laid \nthere quietly and enjoyed the relaxation in my back, the tensionless lying as well as \nthe smooth pulsing warmth in my body. Over time I was able to relax more and more, \nand I noticed that other parts of my body were under unnecessary tension and I \nrelaxed these regions as well. Of course I was just before falling asleep when I was  \ntold that time was over. Happily I sat up and noticed a little tension in my upper back \nthat was treated shortly before. Once again the osteopath adjusted me and when I \ngot up I had a warm and fuzzy feeling of sleepiness and relaxation.]  3) C. - male\n \n \n\u201eEs ist interessant zu sehen, wie man mit kleinen aber gezielten \u201eEingriffen\u201c gro\u00dfe \nEffekte hervorbringen kann. Ich war die Befindlichkeit meines K\u00f6rpers gewohnt- im \nNachhinein hatte ich das Gef\u00fchl, ein wenig k\u00f6rperlos zu ein, etwas nicht mehr tragen \nzu m\u00fcssen, was ich vorher unwissentlich mitgeschleppt habe. W\u00e4re ich eine Flasche, \nso h\u00e4tte ich nun einen etwas weiteren Hals und ein bauchigeres Erscheinungsbild. \nAuch die Tips f\u00fcr die Dehnungen, die ich selber durchf\u00fchren kann, werden mir sehr \nweiterhelfen.  Vielen Dank f\u00fcr die Behandlung. \u201e \n[It is interesting to observe which great effects small but specific procedures can \nhave. I was used to feel my body- afterwards I felt a bit disembodied, like I did not \nhave to carry a weight any longer that I was dragging along unconsciously all the \ntime. If I was a bottle I would now have a wider neck and a more bellied appearance. \nAlso the tips I got for further stretching will help me a lot. Many thanks for the \ntreatment.] \n \n4) D. - female  \n \n\u201eDie osteopathische Behandlung war toll!

Aber auch im Alltag, auch bei anderen \nT\u00e4tigkeiten, neige ich dazu, unn\u00f6tig viel Kraftaufwand einzusetzen. Das, und \nvielleicht in nicht geringem Ausma\u00df auch das Orgelspielen- eine der unges\u00fcndesten \nK\u00f6rperhaltungen- f\u00fchrten zu Verspannungen und Verkrampfungen im K\u00f6rper.  \nNach den kurzen und ein wenig schmerzvollen Momenten der Behandlung waren \nmeine Blockaden gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils gel\u00f6st und meine Stimme konnte sich frei entfalten. \nAuch meine Atemkapazit\u00e4t hatte sich bemerkbar gesteigert.\u201c \n[I permanently run the risk of trying to control the tones I sing. But also in everyday \nlife I tend to use too much strain. That and maybe also the unhealthy poise while \nplaying the organ led to tensions and cramps in the whole body. But after some short \nand a little painful moments during the treatment my blockades were largely released \nand my voice could develop freely. Also my respiratory capacity increased \nperceivably.]  56 \n6) F. female  \n \u201eBesondere Aufmerksamkeit erhielt meine Narbe am Solarplexus- Bereich \n(Bauchnabelfehloperation nach der Geburt), bei ihrer \u201eBearbeitung\u201c f\u00fchlte ich meine \nEnergie im K\u00f6rper losgehen, eine feines \u201eZittern\u201c, das \u00fcberall durchging. \nAnschlie\u00dfend empfand ich im Liegen eine angenehme Offenheit, Weichheit (bis auf \nden Schulter- Nackenbereich, den ich immer am hart\u201cn\u00e4ckigsten\u201c bei mir sp\u00fcre. Auch \nmeine Zeitwahrnehmung \u00e4nderte sich irgendwie- ich werde langsamer nach der \nBehandlung.\u201c \n[My cicatrice (after birth) in the region of the solar plexus received special attention, \nwhen it was \u2018treated\u2019 I felt energy released in the whole body, a slight \u2018tremble\u2019 that \nran through my body. Afterwards I felt a pleasant openness and softness (apart from \nthe shoulder and neck region which I always feel most tenaciously). Also my \nperception of time has changed somehow- I become slower after the treatment.] \n \n7. Results \n During all my examinations and treatments I have never had in mind the \nimprovement of my patients breathing or of their voice. I only watched out for an \nosteopathic lesions and treated them. Interestingly the different patients showed the \nsame osteopathically relevant themes. In the following interpretation I will elaborate \non the anatomic coherences between the treated region and its impact on the human \nsystem.  \n \n7.1. Data interpretation \n The results obtained by means of the tests were interpreted according to two \ndifferent aspects.  \n \nOn the one hand technically, with the aid of an audio engineering programme. A \ndetailed description of this procedure is to be found in chapter 6.3.1. of this paper.\n149 \nFurthermore by means of measuring the length of the maximum phonation time of a \ntone. These results are depicted by means of graphs and explained in the appendix \nof this work.   \nOn the other hand the subjective perception of the music professor and the individual \nfeedback of the students were incorporated.  \n \nAlso the osteopathic diagnosis and conclusion were evaluated. \n \nAll those factors lead to the extensive evaluation of the results of each test person \nwhich can be found in chapter 7.1. within the data interpretation.\n150 \n \nAll those results show that an osteopathic treatment influences the human voice, \nwhich is shown by the following points:  \n                                            \n149 cf. p. 44 of this paper. \n150 cf. p. 56ff of this paper.  57 \n\u2022 Increased voice volume (louder voice) \n\u2022 Purer, softer voice \n\u2022 Different length of the maximum phonation time of a tone \n \nOn average the maximum phonation time of a tone rose from 19,1 seconds to 20,4 seconds in the group of osteopathically treated test persons.\n151 \n                                            \n151 cf. chapter 7.4. of this paper (p.83).  58 \n7.2.

This \nis especially striking at a frequency range between 1.000 and 1.500 Hz. From 1.500 \nto 2.000 Hz the note has got more volume.  \nBetween 300 and 500 Hz and especially from 600 to 800 Hz the note is definitely \nclearer and  thus shows more overtones. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 10 \u2013 1st test person osteopathy  - A. female- first tone triad \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n152 cf.

CONCLUSION:  \nOn the one hand the test person appears to sing better (purer, calmer and partly \nlouder).

Conclusion and future prospects \n \nReferring to the central question if an osteopathic treatment influences the human \nvoice the following results arose: \n \nDemonstrably an osteopathic treatment does have influence on the voice volume and \nthe quality of the voice \u2013 equally on the lenght of the maximum phonation of a tone.  \nAs emanates from the documentation of the te st persons and of Prof. Visca does the \nosteopathic treatment also have influence on the state of mind of the test persons. \n \n \n18,0 19,0 20,0 21,0\nsecondsbefore treatmentafter treatmentaverage testing result length of tone osteopathy\nafter treatment\nbefore treatment\n \nFigure 38 \u2013 average testing result length of tone osteopathy166 \n \n                                            \n166 For the results of respiratory therapy see appendix of this paper (p.88ff). \n 83These results are particularly interesting because i only searched for and treated the \nosteopathic lesions during my treatment. My comparison group were treated \nrespiratory therapeutically. This group showed very positive changes too. \nIt is worth mentioning shows such effects although breath and voice were not treated \nextensively. In comparison to the respiratory therapy which commits itself to breath \nas one determining factor of the voice similar and comparable results were achieved.  \n \nRegarding the testings I have  to stat e that because of the many different \ndocumentations in connection with this study a great spectrum of results is existing. \nThis circumstance enabled me to compare various results with each other and to \ndraw continuative conclusions. I did not go into details concerning the test of the \narbitrary chosen tone in my work as the arbitrary tone is not comparable to the \nothers. The tone a singer allows conclusions concerning his/her state of mind. This \nwas meaningful to the vocal professor but not for the study.  \n \nThe ideas for the testings emerged during conversations with Prof. Visca and Dr. \nMalin. They were well-chosen because of their many interesting and especially \nmeasurable results. However, the suggestion if they could warm up before the tests \nin order to build up the muscle tone necessary was made rather often by the test \npersons. This would a proposal for a further study in this field.   84Summary \n \nIn order to clarify if an osteopathic treatment has got influence on the human voice, a \nstudy on singing students of the University of Music, Vienna was conducted. The \nresults are presented in this paper.  \n \nTo explain the mode of action of an osteopathic treatment the osteopathic concept is \ndescribed. After a chronology of the history of osteopathy the single concepts are \ndepicted and then the osteopathic techniques used throughout the study are \nexplained. In order to illustrate the holistic approach and the \u2018philosophy\u2019 of \nosteopathy (which allows a posterior comparison to the respiratory therapeutic \nconcept), the principles of osteopathy are explained.  \n \nAs in the present study changes in the vo ices of the test persons are measured and \ninterpreted, in the next chapter the human voice (including its anatomic and \nfunctional base) is described. The organs a nd anatomic structures (such as larynx \nand the corresponding muscles, cervical fascia, lungs, heart sac, diaphragm and auxilary respiratory muscles) and their interaction which is necessary for phonation \nare shortly outlined.   \n \nAs breath plays a very important role in the development and the nature of the \nhuman voice and as the comparison group of the present study was treated \naccording to respiratory therapeutic techniques in the fourth chapter the respiratory \ntherapeutic concept based on Middendorf and its techniques and philosophy as well \nas its differentiation from the respiratory massage is depicted. A contraposition of the \nosteopathic and the respiratory therapeutic concept in which similarities as well as \ndifferences are illustrated, follows. \n \nIn chapter six the study itself is presented. After a description of the methodology and \na detailed explanation of the conduct of the tests, results are presented and \ninterpreted. This is made on the one hand by means of comparative diagrams of the \naudio engineering programme (before and after the treatment) and on the other hand \nby means of comparing the length of a tone (before and after the treatment)\n167 \nFurthermore a written documentation by the vocal professor (before and after the \ntreatment) is evaluated. An individual feedback of each and every student describes \ntheir subjective feelings during and after the treatment.  \n \nAll the testings and evaluations described show that a holistic osteopathic treatment \nhas an influence on the human voice. \n \n      \n                                            \n167 As the comparison group of the study \u201esinging\u201c was treated respiratorily this thesis also shows \ngrahical and verbal Analysis of the test persons treated respiratorily.  85Bibliography \n \nBarral, J., Lehrbuch der Viszeralen Osteopathie- Band 1, (Barral-1), 1.

Osteopathie\u201c  \n \nFrau Dr. Lisa Malin lehrt \u201eAtem- und K\u00f6rpertraining\u201c an der Musikuniversit\u00e4t Wien \n(Abteilung Sologesang und Musikdramatische Darstellung). Sie lehrt weiters \nMusiktherapie und die Weiterbildung energetischer Modelle und Methoden an der \nGamed (Akademie f\u00fcr Ganzheitsmedizin). Am Otto Wagner Spital in Wien lehrt sie \nTherapeutische Ber\u00fchrung f\u00fcr Personen des gehobenen Dienstes f\u00fcr Gesundheits- \nund Krankenpflege. Weiters ist sie ausgebildete Atemtherapeutin in freier Praxis. \n \n\u201eFrau Dr. Malin, wie w\u00fcrden Sie Ihre Arbeit in der Atemtherapie und Atembehandlung \nbeschreiben, bzw. was ist Atemtherapie und Atembehandlung \u00fcberhaupt.\u201c \n \n\u201eIm Zentrum steht das Erfahren und Entwickeln des eigenen Atems. Das Bewusstwerden des eigenen Atemrhythmus \u00f6ffnet die M\u00f6glichkeit der Begegnung \nmit sich selbst. Die Atembewegung (Ein-Ausatmen, evtl. Atempause) kann der \nAtementfaltung hinderliche Spannungszust\u00e4nde wie Stress, k\u00f6rperliche \nVerspannung, Anspannung durch belastende Erlebnisse, wieder ins Flie\u00dfen bringen.  \nDurch k\u00f6rperbezogene Dehnung, Druck und Impulse wird der Atem gest\u00e4rkt, so dass \nK\u00f6rper- wie Empfindungsbereiche wieder angeschlossen werden und \u00fcber die \nErfahrung ins Bewusstsein geholt werden.  \nDer eigene Atem wird \u00fcber die H\u00e4nde begleitet und geht in die Entfaltung der \nAtemr\u00e4ume.  \nEin L\u00f6sen f\u00f6rdert den Muskeltonus und unterst\u00fctzt die Aufrichtung. \u00dcber eine \nentwickelte Atemkraft erfahren wir Atemsubstanz, die die leib-seelische Verbindung \ntransparent werden l\u00e4sst. \n \nDort, wo die muskul\u00f6se Panzerung/ Blockade im Brust und R\u00fcckenbereich der \nLunge das Ein/Ausatmen  - somit die Atembewegung- behindert, dort kann die \nEntschlackung/ S\u00e4uberung nicht oder nicht gen\u00fcgend stattfinden. Wird eine l\u00e4nger \nandauernde Blockade gel\u00f6st \u2013 z.B. durch L\u00f6sen und Aktivieren im \nZwischenrippenmuskulaturbereich, so setzt der Entschlackungsvorgang vermehrt ein \nund dadurch auch vermehrte Schleimbildung. \n \nBeim aktiven Begleiten des Atems mittels der H\u00e4nde, d.h. der Atembewegung bis in \ndie Atemr\u00e4ume, somit auch bis in die Flanken, entsteht eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Aktivit\u00e4t der \nLunge in all ihren R\u00e4umen bis in die Vakuolen, Bl\u00e4schen in denen Sauerstoff mit Blut \nausgetauscht wird. \u201e \n \n\u201eFrau Dr. Malin, warum haben Sie die Atembehandlung als Vergleich zur \nosteopathischen Behandlung der Probanden gew\u00e4hlt?\u201c \n \n\u201eAtembehandlung habe ich gew\u00e4hlt, weil es sich besser eignet als Vergleich zur \nosteopathischen Behandlung, auch wenn diese im Aufbau anders strukturiert ist.  \nDie Atembehandlung erm\u00f6glicht am besten, den Istzustand von Atemvolumen, \nAtemrhythmus und wie weit Atembewegung durch den K\u00f6rper flie\u00dft, d.h. welche \nK\u00f6rperteile oder Bereiche angeschlossen sind, ersichtlich zu machen. Nicht nur der  91Ist-Zustand ist ersichtlich, sondern auch die Wandlungsf\u00e4higkeit, die aber nicht von \nau\u00dfen aufgegeben wird, sondern zeigt, wie der K\u00f6rper durch einen Prozess des \nVerstehens und Zulassens an Atementwicklung den n\u00e4chsten Schritt freigeben kann.  \nDie H\u00e4nde der Behandelnden d\u00fcrfen begleiten, unterst\u00fctzen und manchmal fordern \naber nicht \u00fcberfordern. Dieser ganze At emk\u00f6rperprozess muss begleitet sein von \neiner bewussten Atem- und K\u00f6rperbeobachtung, vor allem auch durch ein Sp\u00fcren.  \nHier ist ein Wegdriften, in eine Traumwelt gehen, fehl am Platz.  \n \nDurch eine Konzentration auf den Atemk\u00f6rperprozess \u2013 Loslassen und Neues \nintegrieren -  kann die gew\u00fcnschte Spannung f\u00fcrs Singen erst mal reduziert sein. \nDas hei\u00dft, es muss ein aktiver \u00dcbergang geschaffen werden, oder einfach gen\u00fcgend \nZeit gelassen werden, dass sich das Neue integriert und verbindet und sich die \ngew\u00fcnschte Spannung wieder aufbaut. \n \nIn den \u00dcbungsstunden \u2013 somit im Unterricht- findet ein aktives \u00dcben statt und die \nStudenten kommen nie in eine so tiefe Entspannung wie bei einer Atembehandlung. \nIm \u00dcbungsalltag sind es also immer wieder kleine Schritte, die zugelassen werden. \nSo erz\u00e4hlte mir eine Studentin von einem h\u00f6heren Semester, immer wenn sie ins \nAtemtraining kam und es folgte danach eine Gesangsstunde, musste sie sich nicht \neinsingen \u2013 bis auf ein Mal, wo wir eine tiefe Entspannung ben\u00f6tigten, da wir an der \nL\u00f6sung des R\u00fcckens arbeiteten, so dass die Atembewegung durch einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen \nBereich der Wirbels\u00e4ule floss. Es musste sozusagen eine Alltagsspannung abgebaut \nwerden, um in eine aktive Durchl\u00e4ssigkeit zu kommen. In diesem Fall ben\u00f6tigte die \nStudentin einige Stunden, bis sich die Spannung f\u00fcr den Tag wieder aufbaute. \n \nSo erinnere ich mich: Prof. Ilse Middendorf und Herta Richter lie\u00dfen aus ihrer Arbeit \n(aktives \u00dcbungsarbeiten) mit lautlosen T\u00f6nen beginnend und mit beginnender \nStimmgebung nicht forcierend, vor allem in Vorsicht mit der Lautst\u00e4rke, von innen her \ngestalten und nicht durch einen \u00e4u\u00dferen Anspruch fordern.  \nMarie Theree Escribano hat mit einem Lallen wie ein Kind mit gel\u00f6ster Zunge \nbeginnend und langsam erst die Stimme dazukommen lassend erst sp\u00e4ter die \nArtikulation dazugenommen. \nDa die Erfahrung und die Bewusstheit des eigenen Atems geschult wird, inkludieren \nwir die Person. Der K\u00f6rper muss mit der Person, d.h. auch mit der Pers\u00f6nlichkeit und \ndem eigenen Wesen verbunden sein. Wenn Atemressourcen/ Atemr\u00e4ume, \nDurchl\u00e4ssigkeit etc. aktiv sind, stehen di eser Person mehr aktive Qualit\u00e4ten zur \nVerf\u00fcgung.  \n \n\u201eWie ist eine Atembehandlung aufgebaut?\u201c \n \n\u201e Es wird 40 Minuten lang am Atem- und K\u00f6rpergeschehen gearbeitet und 5 Minuten \ngeruht. Bei den meisten zeigte sich erst nach 30 Minuten die neue Entwicklung, d.h. \nnach ca. 10 Minuten Zeit f\u00fcr ein aktives Integrieren und dann 5 Minuten Ruhen und \nNachsp\u00fcren.\u201c  92 \nDetails zur Atembehandlung von Dr. Malin \n \n \n\u2022 Testperson 1-G. weiblich \n\u00dcber Unterst\u00fctzung der Mitte wird der untere und obere Atemraum mehr \ndurchflossen. Die Patientin hat von Beginn an eine integrierte Atempause (Ein-\n/Ausatem/Atempause). Sie wirkt ruhig und der Atem ist ausgeglichen.  \nLangsam \u00f6ffnet sich der obere Raum. Sie unt erst\u00fctzt es durch befreiendes Seufzen. \nDurch das \u00d6ffnen dieses Bereiches f\u00fcr die Atembewegung taucht eine neue \nStimmung auf. Diese neue Durchl\u00e4ssigkeit l\u00e4sst Fr\u00f6hlichkeit und Freude aufkommen. \nDas Gef\u00fchl von \u201efrei sein\u201c entsteht. Die Patientin \u00f6ffnet die Arme und streckt sie nach \nau\u00dfen. Am Ende ist die Studentin etwas schwindelig durch ein vermehrtes \nLuftaufnehmen.  \nBemerkung der Studentin: \u201eIch sp\u00fcre alles so intensiv bis in die Fingerspitzen.\u201c \nEs ist eine gro\u00dfe Durchl\u00e4ssigkeit entstanden.  \n \n\u2022 Testperson 2- H. m\u00e4nnlich \nEs besteht ein ausgewogener Rhythmus von Ein- und Ausatem. Der Ausatem hat \neine besondere Qualit\u00e4t \u201eein sich ausatmen lassen\u201c. Selbst bei der Ver\u00e4nderung des \nEinatems indem der Einatem gr\u00f6\u00dfer wird, bleibt im Ausatem diese Qualit\u00e4t erhalten. \nDer untere und mittlere Bereich wird von der Atembewegung durchflossen. Es hat \neine gute Wirkung mit den H\u00e4nden die Mitte und somit die Atembewegung in diesem \nBereich zu unterst\u00fctzen. \nBesonders der R\u00fccken l\u00e4dt ein ihn zu l\u00f6sen und mit den H\u00e4nden \u00fcber Unterst\u00fctzen, \nDruck und Begleitung die Atembewegung und somit die Durchl\u00e4ssigkeit zu f\u00f6rdern. \nUnterst\u00fctzende H\u00e4nde aufs Hohlkreuz zu geben hat eine gute Wirkung. Es gibt eine \nSpannung im oberen R\u00fcckenbereich. Es gibt wenig bis keine Atembewegung im \nR\u00fccken. Ich arbeite an einer Linderung der Spannung der Muskeln seitlich der \nWirbels\u00e4ule. Ich beginne im Bereich der Nieren zu arbeiten. Dadurch wird die \nAtembewegung im Becken und in der Mitte st\u00e4rker. Das erm\u00f6glicht, dass leichte \nAusl\u00e4ufer der Atembewegung nach oben gehen.  \n \n \n\u2022 Testperson  3- I. weiblich \nEs gibt eine gute Durchl\u00e4ssigkeit des r\u00fc ckw\u00e4rtigen Beckenbereichs. Es ist sofort \nm\u00f6glich, in ein Atemgespr\u00e4ch zu kommen zwischen dem Atem der Studentin und \nden behandelnden H\u00e4nden. Sie gibt \u00fcber den Atem Raum, antwortet auf \nAnwesenheit und Impulse der behandelnden H\u00e4nde und wendet dann ihre \nAufmerksamkeit wieder zu sich selbst hin. Die Mitte gibt Raum und Durchl\u00e4ssigkeit. \nDas setzt sich fort bis in den oberen Bereich. Es stellen sich lange Atemz\u00fcge ein und \ndie Atembewegung l\u00e4uft vom Becken bis in den Oberk\u00f6rper. Sie \u201el\u00e4sst sich atmen\u201c \n(eine wunderbare Atemqualit\u00e4t). Im vorderen Bereich zeigt sich Durchl\u00e4ssigkeit. Sie \nist auch hier \u00fcber die Ber\u00fchrung im Atemgespr\u00e4ch. Aus der Tiefe taucht \nGelassenheit auf.  \nSie gibt den Atemraum und nimmt ihn auch wieder. Sie antwortet auf einen Impuls \nvon unterst\u00fctzendem Druck mit Weite und Atembewegung, die bis in den Kopf flie\u00dft. \nDie Beine bed\u00fcrfen einer L\u00f6sung und Lebendigkeit, vor allem die Knie. Es entsteht \nW\u00e4rme und Durchl\u00e4ssigkeit in den Beinen. Dadurch, dass die Beine nun besser \nangeschlossen und lebendig sind, zeigt sich noch mehr Weite in den Atemz\u00fcgen.  \n  93 \n\u2022 Testperson 4 \u2013 R. M. weiblich \nDie Patientin zeigt sich als ein zartes Wesen mit einem zarten zaghaften Atem. Die \nAtemr\u00e4ume wirken wenig entwickelt. Im r\u00fcckw\u00e4rtigen unteren Bereich zeigt sich \nAtembewegung. \u00dcber \u201eVertrauen\u201c und \u201eAngenommen werden\u201c geschieht \u00fcber die \nTiefe L\u00f6sung.  Im oberen R\u00fcckenbereich gibt es Spannung. Die Schultern liegen \nnicht auf der Unterlage auf. Die Schultern wirken leicht nach vorne gezogen.  Es gibt \nimmer mehr L\u00f6sung.  Die Patientin erm\u00f6glicht, dass die Atemz\u00fcge sich weiter nach \noben hin entwickeln. Dieser Vorgang ist begleitet von einem \u201eGlucksen\u201c. Der \nAtemrhythmus ist in sich ausgeglichen. Gegen Ende entsteht ein Akzent auf den \nAusatem. Dieser erh\u00e4lt  die Qualit\u00e4t \u201eabzutransportieren\u201c und \u201enach au\u00dfen zu \ngeben\u201c. Die Behandlerin hat 10 Minuten fr\u00fcher die Behandlung beendet, da sie den \nEindruck hatte, \u201ees ist genug\u201c, sonst k\u00f6nnte es f\u00fcr die Patientin zu viel werden. Diese \nFeststellung wurde von der Patientin best\u00e4tigt. Sie \u00e4u\u00dfert sich zum Schluss \u201eEs tut \nsich so viel\u201c.  \n \n\u2022 Testperson 5- T. O. weiblich \nDie Studentin hat einen entwickelten Atem. Sie nimmt leicht Luft, nicht zu viel, und \nentl\u00e4sst sie ganz langsam, ohne dass sich der Willen einschaltet und ohne Druck, in \ngleicher langer Weise. Sie vermittelt einen selbst\u00e4ndigen  Atem.  \nEs zeigt sich, dass die Qualit\u00e4ten \u201eAnwesenheit\u201c und \u201eBegleitung\u201c \u00fcber die H\u00e4nde \nder Behandlerin sich positiv auswirken. (Das wurde von der Studentin nach der \nBehandlung best\u00e4tigt.) \nEs gibt den Eindruck, dass eine Spannung, die sich im oberen r\u00fcckw\u00e4rtigen R\u00fccken \nund Schulterbereich zeigt, den Atemfluss nicht beeintr\u00e4chtigt. Jedoch die \nAtembewegung zeigt die k\u00f6rperliche Spannung an.  \n\u00dcber begleitenden Druck geht ein Wirbel zwischen den Schulterbl\u00e4ttern in die \nrichtige Position \u2013 es knackst. Ebenso durch ein Sch\u00fctteln sowie Aktivieren des \nBereiches, in dem sich die Spannung zeigte, verl\u00e4ngert sich der Ausatem. Der Kopf \nf\u00fchlt sich anschlie\u00dfend ganz frei an und wirkt gel\u00f6st. Der Studentin steht ein in sich \ngeformter Atem zur Verf\u00fcgung, sowie eine Atemverbindung,  ein Atemkanal. \n \n \n\u2022 Testperson 6- W. S. m\u00e4nnlich \nDer Atem zeigt sich im unteren und mittleren Bereich. Der Atemrhythmus ist \nausgewogen. Es gibt eine Blockierung im tiefen Beckenbereich. Eine Ver\u00e4nderung \nwird erreicht durch \n a) L\u00f6sen und \u00d6ffnen der Leisten, durch ein Loslassen der Beine und ein \u00d6ffnen und \nFallenlassen der Beine zu den Seiten hin. Die Beine werden von der Behandlerin \nbewegt und aktiviert. Der Atem wird tiefer und entlastend. Es ensteht  ein Akzent auf \nden Ausatem. Dieser Ausatem  \u201etransportiert ab\u201c und  \u201ebefreit\u201c.  \nb) L\u00f6sung mittels der unterst\u00fctzenden H\u00e4nde in der Nierengegend - dadurch entl\u00e4sst \nder  Atem Spannung. Der entlassende und entlastende Ausatem erm\u00f6glicht, dass \nsich ein befreiender Einatem mit mehr Raum zeigt.  \nTiefe Entspannung folgt. Der Atem zieht in den oberen Bereich ein und bekommt \nRaum. Es entwickeln sich l\u00e4ngere Atemz\u00fcge.  \n \n\u2022 Testperson 7-M. weiblich \nDie Atemr\u00e4ume k\u00f6nnen \u00fcber die Ber\u00fchrung sofort angesprochen werden, vor allem \nin die Weite hinein. Die Patientin kam zur Behandlung gelaufen.  Sie benutzt zu \nBeginn den Ausatem, um zu sich zu kommen.   94Aktivit\u00e4t, Weite und Leistung ist sp\u00fcrbar, jedoch taucht bei der Behandlerin die Frage \nauf, ob Entspannung, in die eigene Tiefe gehen und Erholung f\u00fcr die Studentin \nebenso erreichbar sind. Die R\u00e4ume weiten sich, werden durchl\u00e4ssiger und der \nAtemfluss breitet sich aus. Sp\u00e4ter entsteht der akzentuierte Ausatem. Ein Loslassen \nund ein \u201ein das Eigene gehen\u201c und ein \u201ein die eigene Tiefe\u201c gehen kommt hinzu. Es \nzeigt sich ein ausgeglichener Ausatem.   \n  95Feedback der Studenten zur Atemtherapie \n \nTestperson 1- G. weiblich  \n \nErster Stimmtest  \nIch war ein bisschen unsicher und wollte meine Stimme steuern, was eigentlich \n\u00fcberhaupt nicht geht. \n \nZweiter Stimmtest   \nIch war aufgeregt und immer noch steif im Atem und Stimme \n \nAtembehandlung  \nEs hat sich nach einer Weile etwas im Brustbereich aufgelockert- und ich konnte \npl\u00f6tzlich ganz durchatmen ohne meinen Atem zu steuern oder kontrollieren. Ich habe \ndie Energie von meinem Kopf bis in die Zehen gesp\u00fcrt. Und ich musste l\u00e4cheln- nur \nweil es eine Erleichterung war, das Atmen loszulassen. Es was sehr angenehm und \nberuhigend. \n Dritter Stimmtest- nach Behandlung\n \nIch habe die Stimme nicht gesteuert, sondern einfach nur losgelassen. Dabei habe \nich gesp\u00fcrt, dass sie ganz frei geklungen hat. Es ist durch die Behandlung alles viel \nweicher geworden und viel besser f\u00fcr die Stimme, aber dadurch auch be\u00e4ngstigend \n(frightening), weil ich das Gef\u00fchl bekommen habe, dass ich nicht mein Instrument \nsteuern k\u00f6nnte/ aber das ist gut! Weil man/ ich lernen muss, der Stimme zu \nvertrauen und loslassen zu k\u00f6nnen. Alles in allem ein sehr gutes Ergebnis und sehr \nwichtig \n \n \nTestperson 2- H. m\u00e4nnlich   \n \nEs war sehr entspannend und interessant, seine eigenen Au\u00dfengrenzen kennen zu \nlernen. Schwierig ist, in der Behandlung seinen Atem nat\u00fcrlich zu f\u00fchren. Ich habe \ndas Gef\u00fchl, ich h\u00e4tte viel mehr Atemraum zur Verf\u00fcgung. Dieser gr\u00f6\u00dfer scheinende \nRaum wirkt seelisch beruhigend \u2013 f\u00fchle mich aber f\u00fcrs Singen ein wenig zu \nintrovertiert.  Der eine Moment mit dem Druck von oben auf den Kopf wirkte eher \nbeklemmend/ das Anziehen aber sehr befreiend. \n \n \nTestperson 3- I. weiblich  \n \nIch fand die Atembehandlung \u00e4u\u00dferst  angenehm und entspannend. Mir war, bis zu \ndieser Studie, nicht so wirklich bewusst, was es hei\u00dft, mit dem ganzen K\u00f6rper atmen \nzu k\u00f6nnen. Ich glaube, dass ich im allt\u00e4glichen Leben sehr gut wei\u00df, wie ich zu \natmen habe, doch durch Ihre Behandlung wurde mir erst bewusst, wie ich es noch \nverbessern k\u00f6nnte. Allerdings glaube ich, dass die Atembehandlung den Stimmtest \nnur willk\u00fcrlich beeinflusst hat. Ich bin \u00fcberzeugt, dass sich Ihre Atembehandlung \npositiv auf meine Stimme und mein K\u00f6rpergef\u00fchl ausgewirkt hat. Aber den Stimmtest \nfand ich einfach zu kurz und zu nichtssagend, dass ich mir nicht vorstellen kann, \ndass man mit so wenig Sing\u00fcbungen schon feststellen kann, was, und in welchem \nAusma\u00df sich im K\u00f6rper und im Klang ver\u00e4ndert hat.  \n  96Testperson 4- J. weiblich  \n \nBeruhigend, den eigenen Atem zu sp\u00fcren- man f\u00fchlt, ob es flie\u00dft oder nicht. \nNur durch das Atmen und Loslassen wird man ruhig. Es ist schwierig, sich einfach \nden H\u00e4nden zu \u00fcberlassen, aber wenn es gelingt ist es ein wichtiges warmes Gef\u00fchl. \nEs ist unglaublich, wie viel Spannungen so gel\u00f6st werden k\u00f6nnen \u2013 so, dass es fast \nschmerzt. Sich von oben bis unten sp\u00fcren- gutes Gef\u00fchl (nicht nur \u00e4u\u00dferlich sondern \nauch von innen).  \nIm Schulter und Kopfbereich h\u00e4tte ich noch mehr \u201eentspannen\u201c k\u00f6nnen.  \nAtem \u201egeht tiefer\u201c, Resonanzr\u00e4ume gr\u00f6\u00dfer und elastischer (vom Gef\u00fchl her). \n \nTestperson 5- K. weiblich  \n \nWas ich empfunden habe w\u00e4hrend der Behandlung war erstens tiefe Entspannung \nund zweitens eine Expansion meiner Luftressourcen. \n \nEntspannung  \n\u00dcberall wo Lisa mich  ber\u00fchrte, konnte ich nicht anders, als loslassen. Ihre Griffe \nwaren fest, aber nicht unangenehm/ im Gegenteil. Ich habe mich dadurch eher \ngeborgen gef\u00fchlt. Meine Atemz\u00fcge wurden tiefer und die Pausen zwischen Aus- und \nEinatmen haben sich vergr\u00f6\u00dfert. \u00d6fters zu Atmen war \u00fcberfl\u00fcssig- es war als ob mir \ndurch Lisas Griffe Luft eingeatmet w\u00fcrde.  \n \nExpansion meiner Luftressourcen  \nIch musst \u00f6fters tief Seufzen oder eher durchatmen, wenn Blockaden und \nSpannungen aufgel\u00f6st wurden, und dadurch mehr Platz f\u00fcrs Atmen war (oder mehr \nPlatz f\u00fcr Luft geschaffen wurde). \nDer Beweis daf\u00fcr war der letzte Stimmcheck, bei welchem ich den lang anhaltenden \nTon viel l\u00e4nger halten konnte, wie beim ersten Stimmcheck (ca. 7 Sekunden l\u00e4nger). \nIch habe es als sehr schwierig empfunden, nach so einer entspannenden \nBehandlung singen zu m\u00fcssen. Ich habe mich  regelrecht dazu \u201ezwingen\u201c m\u00fcssen. \nMeine Muskeln haben nicht die notwendige Spannung gehabt, zu singen. Au\u00dferdem \nhabe ich Schleim auf der Stimme gehabt, und ein klarer Ton war nicht zu schaffen. \nEin gewisser Schleim ist immer auf der Stimme aber ich nehme an, wenn die \nMuskeln nicht die notwendige Spannung aufbringen k\u00f6nnen, dar\u00fcber hinweg zu \nsingen, wird es h\u00f6rbar.  \n \nRes\u00fcmee  \nDirekt vor dem Singen kann ich mir schon eine \u00e4hnliche Behandlung vorstellen, \nvielleicht eine, die nicht ganz so entspannend ist bzw. nicht so in die Tiefe geht. \nLisa sp\u00fcrt ganz genau, welche Bereiche fest oder blockiert sind. Wenn man diese \nBereiche vor dem Singen \u201eaufmachen\u201c und aktivieren k\u00f6nnte, ohne eine \nentspannende Wirkung herbeizurufen, glaube ich, dass man dadurch enorm viel \ngewinnen k\u00f6nnte (es w\u00e4re sogar eine Geheimwaffe).  \n \n \nTestperson 6- L. m\u00e4nnlich  \n \nIch finde es sehr gut, dass jemand so was (Atemtherapie) tut. Es k\u00f6nnten aber \nmehrere Gesangs\u00fcbungen sein, oder ein kleines Fragment von einem Lied/ Arie. \nJedenfalls hat es Spa\u00df gemacht, und die Atemsession war sehr angenehm.   97Testperson 6- M. weiblich  \n \nIch war Teilnehmerin der Atembehandlung. Die Behandlung war sehr angenehm und \nentspannend. Sie wurde in einem kleinen Zimmer abgehalten und hat 40 Minuten \ngedauert. Es war eine Massage jener Teile meines K\u00f6rpers, die auf den Atem \nEinfluss haben. Nachdem die Therapeutin, meinen Bauch, Brust, R\u00fccken und Beine \nmassiert hatte, wurde mein Atem gr\u00f6\u00dfer und ich war ruhig. Die ganze Behandlung \nhat sehr gro\u00dfen Einfluss auf meine Stimme gehabt. Der Klang ist voll geworden und \nich konnte ihn l\u00e4nger halten.  98Dokumentation Ergebnisse Atemtherapie durch Prof. Visca \n \n1.Testperson, G. weiblich  \n \nStress bei erstem Test, beim zweiten Test Bruststimme benutzt- das ist die \nbequemere Lage f\u00fcr sie. \nBeim dritten Test relaxter. Der Klang war in ihr geschwungen, Untert\u00f6ne in \nBruststimme sehr sch\u00f6n im K\u00f6rper.
