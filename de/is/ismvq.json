If we can get the best bang for our buck with each of our food choices, we\u2019re more likely to feel totally nourished and also satisfied until our next meal. The result? Eating for nourishment with a lower chance of overeating. We\u2019re breaking down ten healthy foods that keep you full that also happen to be super delicious, and full of all the nutritional goodness the body craves.\nRELATED:\n[Don\u2019t Feel Full After Meals? Try These 3 Genius Hacks](https://fitonapp.com/nutrition/tips-for-satiety/)\nWhy You Need to Know About Filling Foods\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about what makes a food filling.\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of some of the things you will want to look out for when boosting your diet with satiating foods.\n- Rich in dietary fiber.\n- Free from refined sugar.\n- Rich in protein.\n- Great source of healthy fat.\n10 Foods That Keep You Full All Day Long\n#1 Oatmeal\nNot all breakfast foods are created equal. There\u2019a a huge difference between starting your day with a sugary bowl of cereal, and fueling up on foods that keep you full like a bowl of oats.\nOats are loaded with fiber \u2014 you\u2019ll pack in about 4 grams in one cup of cooked oatmeal. Sprinkle on some flaxseeds and some blueberries, and you have a super fiber-rich meal to start your day.\nNot only will this help keep blood sugar levels stable throughout your AM, but you may be less likely to reach for that sugary AM snack (win!)\n#2 Quinoa\nQuinoa is another one of those foods that keep you full we\u2019re totally here for. Quinoa is a plant-based rockstar. It\u2019s one of the few plant-based foods that\u2019s considered a complete protein, and it\u2019s also rich in fiber.\nProtein + fiber equals the dynamic duo of filling foods. In one cup of cooked quinoa, you\u2019ll pack in about 8 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber.\nSo, swap out the white rice for some quinoa and take your meals to a new filling and nourishing level.\n#3 Lentils\nWe also love lentils around here. Not only are they another plant-based superfood that adds in a healthy dose of protein, but lentils can help keep you full between meals.\nTry using lentils instead of ground beef in recipes like spaghetti bolognese, or tacos, or simply add some cooked lentils to your favorite pasta dish or salad.\nYou\u2019ll be shocked at how these tiny legumes can pack in a powerful filling punch.\n#4 High Fiber Fruits\nBy now, you get the hint that fiber is king when it comes to satiety. So, it\u2019s no surprise that high fiber fruits are something we all could be enjoying to boost our diet with foods that keep you full.\nSome great high fiber fruits include all berries (blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries), apples, mango, pears, and avocados.\n#5 Eggs\nHere\u2019s a food that has nothing to do with fiber, but everything to do with protein. Since protein helps promote satiety, we also want to make sure that we are getting enough of it to help us feel full.\nIn one single egg, you\u2019ll rack up about 6 grams of protein, making it a great protein-rich snack to help keep you full between meals. Try pairing a hard-boiled egg with a handful of almonds, and a side of berries for the ultimate filling snack.\n#6 Full-Fat Greek Yogurt\nIf you can tolerate dairy, full-fat unsweetened Greek yogurt makes another quick and easy filling snack that can be dressed up with a handful of berries, and a sprinkle of nuts and seeds for some added crunch.\nOne cup of Greek yogurt can contain up to 20 grams of protein (depending on the brand). So, that\u2019s a pretty hefty dose of protein to help keep you full until lunch or dinner.\nNot a big fan of the tangy taste? Try adding a drizzle of raw honey.\n#7 Nuts\nSpeaking of almonds, nuts are another great filling option when you need a quick snack or a pick-me-up after an intense workout.\nNuts are rich in plant-based protein, fat, and fiber, making them a well-balanced way to nourish your body and promote satiety.\nFeeling adventurous? Try mixing up some homemade trail mix with almonds, cashews, walnuts, goji berries, and raw cacao nibs for the ultimate snack.\n#8 Coconut Oil\nHere\u2019s another one of those foods that keep you full that also adds a powerful punch of healthy fat. Coconut oil is rich in medium-chain triglycerides that can be used as a quick source of energy. And, a\n[study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9701177) found that those who had breakfast with medium-chain triglycerides ate less calories at lunch.\nSo, if you\u2019re looking to boost your breakfast (or really any meal) with the power of coconut oil, try adding some to your smoothie or your morning cup of coffee.\n#9 Avocados\nAvocados are a nutritional powerhouse. Plus, they\u2019re delicious and can be added to so many things. From adding avocado to a smoothie for added creaminess to enjoying some avocado toast or homemade guac, you really can\u2019t go wrong.\nAnd, avocados happen to be one of those foods that keep you full that come with numerous health benefits like packing in a mega-dose of fiber, healthy fat, and important vitamins and minerals like magnesium.\nSo, go on and get your avocado fix. This savory fruit has so much to offer.\n#10 Dark Leafy Greens\nAll hail the mighty greens. Dark leafy greens are always a great addition to any diet, and they can certainly add some bulk to any meal, leaving you nourished and feeling full. Try adding some greens like kale to a stir-fry, an omelet, or even a veggie muffin to add a superfood boost and keep you feeling full.\nEat For Nourishment & Satiety\nHealthy eating should leave you feeling good and leave you satisfied after each meal. This involved choosing the foods that are going to help balance blood sugar levels, keep cravings at bay, and help keep you feeling nourished between meals. So, fill your diet with these nutrient-dense foods to help take your healthy eating to the next level.\nWant more healthy eating inspiration?
