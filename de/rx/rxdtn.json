GPIHBP1 autoantibody syndrome is an important differential diagnosis in patients with newly diagnosed unexplained severe chylomicronemia. Searching for associated autoimmune diseases is an important step after diagnosing GPIHBP1 autoantibody syndrome. So far, 22 patients have been described worldwide. Thus, experience with therapies is also limited. Conventional lipid lowering drugs have only marginal effects if any; this applies also for different forms of diets. Extracorporal therapies to lower triglycerides as well as autoantibody levels have only short term effects. According to our data and based on the successful treatment and the relatively long-time follow up period of this patient, as the first case with GPIHBP1 autoantibody syndrome in Germany, Rituximab can be considered as a therapeutic option for the treatment of GPIHBP1 autoantibody syndrome as it can be safely applied and has long lasting effects on autoantibody levels. It can also be used as a maintenance therapy for long-term control of the disease. However there is no sufficient data regarding RTX as only very few patients have been treated with this substance so far and the follow up data scarce in these patients. In the future more patients with this syndrome need to be identified in order to determine the best treatment options as well as the duration of treatment. Furthermore, this will also shed some light on the nature of the disese and its tendency to reoccur after successful treatment.\n610 Medical sciences\n[https://ror.org/023b0x485](https://ror.org/023b0x485) [http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-7929](http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-7929) [urn:nbn:de:hebis:77-openscience-cb8ca30a-435d-4af2-9125-8d97edf4d15f9](https://nbn-resolving.org/urn/resolver.pl?urn=nbn:de:hebis:77-openscience-cb8ca30a-435d-4af2-9125-8d97edf4d15f9) [http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/) [JGU-Publikationen](/handle/20.500.12030/2)\nFiles in This Item:\n|File||Description||Size||Format|", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["#content", "https://ub.uni-mainz.de", "#", "/mydspace", "/profile", "#", "/advanced-search", "/community-list", "/browse?type=author", "/browse?type=title", "/browse?type=dateissued", "/browse?type=dateavailable", "/browse?type=subject", "/browse?type=type", "/browse?type=department", "#", "https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/7944?locale=en", "https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/7944?locale=de", "#", "/help-faq", "/help-research", "/help-faq-search", "/help-publish", "https://www.ub.uni-mainz.de/de/dissertationen", "/contact", "/", "/handle/20.500.12030/1", "/handle/20.500.12030/2", "/browse?type=author&value=Abdelhamid%2C+Amira+Abdelhamid+Zaky", "https://ror.org/023b0x485", "http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-7929", "https://nbn-resolving.org/urn/resolver.pl?urn=nbn:de:hebis:77-openscience-cb8ca30a-435d-4af2-9125-8d97edf4d15f9", "http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/", "/handle/20.500.12030/2", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/7944/1/glycosylphosphatidylinositolv-20221010104208704.pdf", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/7944/1/glycosylphosphatidylinositolv-20221010104208704.pdf", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/7944/1/glycosylphosphatidylinositolv-20221010104208704.pdf", "/handle/20.500.12030/7944?mode=full", "/handle/20.500.12030/7944/statistics", "/imprint", "/privacy", "/contact", "/guidelines", "https://doi.org/10.18452/24678", "https://www.uni-mainz.de/"]}
