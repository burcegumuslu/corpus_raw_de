Therefore 2010 was the 5th year of the institute\u2019s opera-\ntional activity. Evaluation regarding it s continuation until 2013 took place in \nspring 2009. The evaluation results were (fortunately) very positive. \nIn 2010 the annual budget of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Health \nTechnology Assessment - funded by th e Ludwig Boltzmann Society and in-\nstitutional partners \u2013 was \u20ac 820.000. Additional third party funding \namounted to 12.4% of the budget. \n1.1 Partners \nIn line with the research policy of the Ludwig Boltzmann Society, the insti-\ntute focuses on translational resear ch. The research programme requires \nstrong emphasis on applicable short term  or medium term results. By setting \nup partnerships between research-producing and research-applying organisa-tions or institutions, the quick transfer  of research results is guaranteed. \nThe partner-institutions of the Lu dwig Boltzmann Institute for Health \nTechnology Assessment are stakeholders in health care administration (2), \nresponsible bodies of public hospital s (2) and private universities (1).  \n \nTILAK/ Tiroler Landeskrankenanstalten GmbH  \nAnichstra\u00dfe 35, 6020 Innsbruck \nhttp://www.tilak.at \nKAGES/ Steierm\u00e4rkische Krankenanstalten GmbH  \nStiftingtalstra\u00dfe 4-6, 8010 Graz \nhttp://www.kages.at \n 2010:  \n5th year of existence \nevaluation regarding continuation until 2013 \ntotal budget \ninstitutional partners \nAnnual Report \n2010 \n6 LBI-HTA | 2011 AUVA/ Allgemeine Unfallversicherungsanstalt  \nAdalbert-Stifterstra\u00dfe 65, 1201 Wien  \nhttp://www.auva.at (until May 2010) \nBMG/ Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit  \nRadetzkystra\u00dfe 2, 1030 Wien  http://www.bmg.gv.at \nUMIT/ Private Universit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Gesundheitswissenschaften, Medi-\nzinische Informatik und Technik  \nInstitut f\u00fcr Public Health, Medical Decision Making und HTA Eduard Walln\u00f6fer-Zentrum I, 6060 Hall  http://www.umit.at \nPMU/ Paracelsus Medizinische Privatuniversit\u00e4t \nInstitut f\u00fcr Public Health  Ignaz Harrer Stra\u00dfe 79, 5020 Salzburg http://www.pmu.ac.at (until May 2010) \nHVB/ Hauptverband der \u00f6sterreichischen Sozialversicherungstr\u00e4ger  \nKundmanngasse 21, 1030 Wien http://www.hauptverband.at (since 2008) \n \n \nThe Institute \u2013 an Overview \nLBI-HTA | 2011 7 1.2 Committees \nThe LBI-HTA is supported by two committees, namely the Board of Trus-\ntees and the Scientific Advisory Group (SAG).  \nFigure 1.3-1: Organigramm \nWhereas the LBI-HTA\u2019s research programme provides a general methodo-\nlogical background, agenda setting for current projects is the task of the \nBoard of Trustees, which is composed of  one representative from each insti-\ntutional partner.  \nKAGES: Mag.

The \nfollowing topics were discussed: \n\uf062 Budget 2010/11 \n\uf062 Current scientific  programm 2010/11  \n\uf062 Scoping und defining issues conten t: centralized care in oncology. \n\uf062 The future of the Institute - 2013+: Presentation of LBI-HTA pro-\njects and its results: \u201eImpact of  HTA-research on the Austrian \nhealth care system\u201d followed by a presentation of possible models \nfor the maintenance and sustainabl e implementation of the Insti-\ntute in Austria. \nThe Scientific Advisory Group (SAG)  gives scientific support and is se-\nlected \u2013 with equal weighting \u2013 by the Ludwig Boltzmann Society and the \nmembers of the Board of Trustees. Th e SAG is composed of the following \nmembers: \n\uf062 Univ. Prof. Dr. Finn Borlum Kristensen/ DK (Chair) \n\uf062 Univ. Prof. Dr. Alistair Gray/ UK \n\uf062 Univ. Prof. Dr. J\u00fcrgen Windeler/ D \n\uf062 Dr. Dagmar L\u00fchman/ D \n\uf062 Dr. Irina Cleemput/ BE (since 2010) \nFollowing a four year of contribution , Univ. Prof. Norman Waugh/ UK left \nthe academic Board of LBI-HTA in 20 10. His successor is Dr. Irina Cleem-\nput from the Belgian Health Care Knowledge Center/ KCE. \nThe fourth meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group  took place at the LBI-\nHTA on 23/11/2010. The morning began with the Institute\u2019s Director\u2019s breif brief summary of the \nresults of the Evaluation in May 2009 and the research conducted in the sub-\nsequent year. Then four employees pres ented individual projects perceived to \nbe particularly methodologically challenging. The aims of the Scientific Ad-visory Board meeting were to obtain expert opinions and, where necessary, \nsuggestions for improvement and to explore potential cooperation opportuni-ties. Projects in the field of health serv ices research are particularly challeng-\ning:  \n\uf062 Outpatient cardiac rehabilitati on: Retrospective cohort study \n(with/ without phase III rehabilitation) and, as a follow-up project in 2010/11, development of a study protocol for a prospective, con-\ntrolled study to assess the effectiveness of phase III rehabilitation (Brigitte Piso) \n\uf062 Observational study of kypho- an d vertebroplasty (Brigitte Piso) \n\uf062 Evaluations of child and adolescent psychiatry (Roman Winkler) 1st board meeting \n23/03/2010 \n \n2nd board meeting  \n12/10/2010 \n5 members of the \nScientific Advisory \nGroup \n4thmeeting of the \nScientific Advisory \nGroup:  \n23/11/2010 The Institute \u2013 an Overview \nLBI-HTA | 2011 9 \uf062 Measuring disease \u2013 Patient-relevant outcomes versus surrogate \noutcomes \u2013 an internationa l manual? (Anna Nachtnebel) \nThe afternoon was devoted to the future of LBI-HTA (2013+). First, the Di-\nrector, Claudia Wild, presented the re search profile and excerpts from the \npreviously-developed strategy. This wa s followed by report from the Insti-\ntute\u2019s Deputy, Ingrid Zechmeister on the results of the recent LBI-HTA pro-\nject \u201e The impact of HTA on the health care system in Austria\u201c. By means of \na discussion, the meeting\u2019s participants tried to iden tify the structural and \nprocedural requirements for the LBI- HTA to become an independent HTA \nInstitute in the future.  \n1.3 Staff & Human Resources Development \nAs an interdisciplinary institute the organisation of work is guided by profes-sional \u2013 assigned topic-specific \u2013 proj ect management. Again, the compulsory \nweekly team meeting (Tuesdays at 2 p. m.) proved to be essential and neces-\nsary for effective team communication at the LBI-HTA. \nDirector & Head of department \u2018High Tech in Hospitals\u2019: \n\uf062 Claudia Wild , Priv.-Doz.

At the LBI-HTA he worked in the fi eld of Modelling and Simulation (20 \nhrs/week); he has since worked at the Institute for Analysis and Scientific Computing at the Technical University of Vienna.  \nSabine Geiger-Gritsch  worked as a researcher at the LBI-HTA until  \n30/09/2010. She was active in the field of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (20 \nhrs./week). Since 01/10/2010 Sabine Geiger-Gritsch has been employed ex-clusively at the UMIT.  \nBesides the organisational development of  an interdisciplinary research insti-\ntute, professionalisation and specialisation of the team members are key is-\nsues. Becoming an interdisciplinary rese arch institute involves the exchange \nof perspectives and methodologies, c ooperation during projects, internal \npresentations and discussions and internal evaluati ons in order to ensure \nhigh quality work.  \nThe LBG arranges regular CPD training fo r the leaders of its institutes, with \nthe aim of the professionalisation of its management.

In this Joint \nAction, the LBI-HTA is leading Work package 7B , with the aim of reducing \noverlaps in EU-wide HTA work. A web- based database of all planned and \nongoing Assessments (POP database ) is to be made available to all \nEUnetHTA partner organisations. To that end, since January 2010 the LBI-HTA has been collecting all planne d and ongoing projects every three \nmonths. These projects are sorted accord ing to topic and are made available \nto partners. The web-based POP database  is currently being developed in co-\noperation with the Belgian HTA Institute KCE. It will be completed in June 2011 and subsequently made available to all contrubting EUnetHTA part-ners.  There has been further cooperation with other EUnetHTA partner or-\nganisations, such as during the LBI- HTA \u201eHorizon Scanning in Oncology\u201c \nproject. Further cooperation, for example in the 2011 MEL assessments, is planned.   \nFollowing an initial test of the \u201e Horizon Scanning Systems for Oncology \u201c \nin 2009, this programme has since been  successfully implemented into rou-\ntine LBI-HTA practice. 14 Decision Support Documents for Horizon Scan-\nning in Oncology have been published since autumn 2009, including 9 in \n2010. Following regular scanning of (a to tal of 27) different data sources and \nwebsites and an initial selection, a gr oup of interdisciplinary experts decide \nfor which of these drugs short and conc ise Assessments should be carried out \nto be passed on to decision makers (pharmaceutical commission). As these \nearly assessments are made available ar ound the same time as they are li-\ncensed by the EMA and are published (only) in English, they have aroused significant interest internationally, as well as in Austria. All Horizon Scan-\nning in Oncology Decision Support Documents are available online at \nhttp://hta.lbg.ac.at/de/ content.php?iMenuID=96 international \ndistribution \ninternational \ncooperation: EUnetHTA \nJoint Action 2010-2012 \nLBI-HTA leads WP 7B \n reduction of overlaps   POP database  further cooperation \nplanned \nHorizon Scanning in \nOncology: aroused significant in-terest  Annual Report \n2010 \n16 LBI-HTA | 2011 \nDue to apprent EU-wide overlaps, the considerable financial implications \nand the increased demand for the evaluation of oncology drugs, a 2 day \n\u201eWorkshop on Onco-drugs\u201c  took place at the LBI-HTA at the end of Sep-\ntember/beginning of October. 20 people  from 12 European HTA Institutes \ntook part, in order to - for the first time - develop options for future coopera-\ntion in the rapid evaluation of oncolo gy drugs. This workshop was proposed \nand hosted by the LBI-HTA, as the le ad partner of the EUnetHTA Joint Ac-\ntion WP 7B. The joint publication of two Horizon Scaning in Oncology As-\nsessments  with partner institutions ( Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Bremen  and the \nPolish institute AHTAPol ; early January 2011) is one of the first outcomes \nof this successful get-together. \nThe evaluation of individual medical services (MEL)  before their inclusion \nin the benefit-catalogue, which was first carried out in 2007/08, is now being \nconducted annually. Completing this task in just a few weeks (mid-January to end of March) is not just a methodological challenge, but also as an organ-isational one; however, with increasi ng experience it is becoming increas-\ningly routine.  This year, for the s econd time, the LBI-HTA has cooperated \nwith its German counterpart, \u201cNUB /New diagnosis and treatment proce-\ndures\u201c, which is often simultaneously faced with similar or identical new \nmedical techniques. Again, these assessm ents have led to a number of scien-\ntific publications this year . \nAs part of the \u201eEUnetHTA Joint Action 2010-2012\u201c project (see above), co-\noperation with other EUnetHTA partners  is planned for the 2011 MEL cy-\ncle. As part of this cooperation, join t bilingual (D/E) assessments of \u201enew \nhigh tech interventions in hospitals\u201c will be conducted. This project is being \nled by the LBI-HTA within its capacity as co-lead partner of work package 7, \n\u201eNew Technologies\u201c. \n11 members of the LBI-HTA team took part in the 11th Annual conference \nof the  German Network for Evidence-Based Medicine , \u201cEBM \u2013 a gain for \nthe Doctor-Patient Relationship?\u201d, which took place in Salzburg on 25th-27th July.  \nOn the initiative of the ORAC publishing company, the Institute\u2019s book \n\u201cZahlenspiele in der Medizin \u2013 Eine kritische Analyse \u201d (\u201cNumber games \nin medicine \u2013 A critical analysis\u201d) was writtenin the second half of 2009. The book deals with the often highly sugge stiveand therefore potentially mislead-\ning ways in which figures can be presented in the field of medicine. The 16th chapter of the book attempts to de monstrate these \u201cnumber games\u201d, using \nnumerous examples which are notable for their impact and/or timeliness. \nThe aim of the book is to develop in its readers a certain awareness of these \nfigures and statistics, and an understanding of how to interpret them.

We celebrated these speci al occasions accordingly.  \n1.6 Research Programme \nThe work program of the LBI-HTA consis ts of five programme lines, which \nwill be briefly described. All project s will be explained in chapter 2 (re-\nsearch), within the context of the different programme lines. \nComprehensive assessments of h ealth interventions & evidence-\nbased health services research \nHTA can now look back on 20 years of  methodological developments and in-\nternational harmonisation. \u201eTraditional\u201d assessments answer questions on \nnew/innovative or established medical interventions such as  \n\uf062 Is the intervention effective, does it work? \n\uf062 For whom, which subgroup of patients? \n\uf062 At what cost? \n\uf062 How does the intervention compare with alternatives? \nUnlike traditional HTA, evidence-based health services are still young, but \nare based on the same basic research pr inciples: systematic literature search \nand analysis, transparent presentation of sources, process and results and in-terdisciplinary perspectives. In contrast to the results from the critical ap-praisal of medical interventions, the resu lts from health services research are \ndeeply anchored in the health system s concerned and cannot be as easily \ntransferred into other systems. The rese arch field of evidence-based planning \nfollows the approach of distinguishi ng between demand and need and of \ncritically questioning the actual utilisation of health services.  \nFor that reason, the LBI-HTA, as an HT A institute in a small country, is de-\nvoted to bringing international HTA into  the national context and to further \ndeveloping methods of evidence-based health services research. \nScientific support of health poli cy and decision-maker networks \nPolicy-relevant decisions are traditionally  reached on the basis of a consensus \nof high-ranking experts in boards and committees. This process of exclu-\nsively expert-based (so-called eminen ce-based) decision-making is highly \nprone to bias, conflict of interests an d doctrine. It is the aim of evidence-\nbased support to decision-making to co llect and present recent research re-\nsults and to provide a more rational an d transparent input to the process of \nhealth policy decision-making, indepe ndent of influences from interest \ngroups. The aim is to shape the process in the long term by systematically \nquestioning marketed information an d by asking for sound evidence. \nIt is the task of the scientific support  of health policy and decision-maker \nnetworks to react rapidly to demand an d to present the evidence to decision-\nmakers in a transparent and readable format. weddings & \nchildren \nprogramme line 1 \nprogramme line 2 The Institute \u2013 an Overview \nLBI-HTA | 2011 21 Health Technology Assessment in hospitals \nThe informal \u201eHTA in hospitals\u201d network consists of a group of about 20 \nhigh-ranking decision-makers (medical directors and quality managers) from \nalmost exclusively Austrian hospital cooperation. The network meets twice a \nyear (June and October) in order to ob tain informative HTA input into 4 key \ntopics, to discuss them and to exchan ge ideas on regulation and reimburse-\nment issues. \nThe task of the LBI-HTA is to coordinate the meetings, to request and col-\nlect current topics and to prepare the presentations. The format of the meet-\nings is for each topic to be presen ted from the HTA perspective and by an \ninvited clinical expert, which subsequently  leads into a structured discussion.  \nScientific decision support of the Health Ministry \nIt is the task of the LBI-HTA to provid e - on request - scientific support to \ndifferent committees of the Austrian Health Ministry (BMG, http://www.bmg.gv.at ): \n\uf062 to support the Medical Advisory Group in the maintenance of the \nAustrian medical procedure classification (Austrian DRG Cata-logue) with evidence analysis of  new/innovative or established \nmedical interventions. \n\uf062 to react to information enquiries in the Supreme Health Council \n(advisory committee of the Health Minister). \nPublic understanding and research transfer \nQuite often - steered by early media coverage - the demand for new/innovative health care interventi ons emerges, even before market ap-\nproval or reimbursement. \u201ePublic understanding\u201d is both the transfer of \nknowledge about market forces and abou t methods for critically questioning \nthe evidence presented on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, appropriate-ness, and methodological support for the differentiation between new and \ninnovative interventions. \u201ePublic understanding\u201d is me ant to contribute to a \nbetter understanding of true effectivene ss and, at the same time, to a democ-\nratic shaping of benefit packages. \nThe intention of \u201epublic understanding and resear ch transfer\u201d is to build up \n- through presentations, seminars, mo nthly newsletter, a user-friendly web-\nsite and search support - a critical ma ss of patients, journalists, representa-\ntives of the health administration, academia etc. that questions the informa-\ntion presented and asks for sound evidence before decision making. \nHTA-implementation: Development and informing on effective policy instruments\n \nEvidence for the effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of numerous technolo-\ngies and interventions can often only be  presented after market approval and \nseveral years\u2019 use under real clinical conditions. However, even then, ineffec-\ntive technologies are widely spread and applied. Since it is ethically not justi-fiable to withhold true medical innovations from patients, and because pseudo-innovations absorb a lot of re sources, taking new technologies under \n\u201esurveillance\u201d or \u201elimited application\u201d at specific medical centres is increas-\ningly frequently considered. Consequent ly, final decisions on reimbursement \nare made only after patient-relevant outcome data become available. programme line 3 \nprogramme line 4 Annual Report \n2010 \n22 LBI-HTA | 2011 Methods for limited application and th e assessment and appraisal of tech-\nnologies and interventions after having obtained patient-relevant outcome \ndata are still young. In this programme  line, they will be further developed \nand applied. \nInternational cooperation / HTA Best Practice  \nInternational cooperation and collaboration, particularly within the Euro-pean Union, is becoming increasingly important in order to avoid redundan-cies in the assessment of medical techno logies prior to reimbursement or in-\nclusion in public benefit catalogues. Dr ugs that have been approved by the \nEuropean regulatory authority EMEA are being launched simultaneously in European markets. In addition, medica l products and technologies are being \nlaunched nearly at the same ti me in European markets.    \nThe EU-project \u201cEUnetHTA \u2013 Europe an Network for Health Technology \nAssessments\u201d is concerned with the development and implementation of structures and networks for transnat ional HTA-cooperation. This project \nwas funded by the EU from 2006 to 2008 and was continued without public funding throughout 2009. From 2010 until 2012, in the form of a Joint Ac-tion, it is again be funded by the EU. \nThe LBI-HTA was co-initiator and has been a leading partner of EUnetHTA \nfor several years. The LBI-HTA manage s work package 7 in close coopera-\ntion with the French HAS/Haute Author it\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9. Work package 7 is con-\ncerned with rapid exchange of inform ation on the assessment of new tech-\nnologies after their approval but prior to their introduction on the market. \n programme line 5  \nLBI-HTA | 2011 23 2 Research \n2.1 Projects and Scientific Support of Decision-\nmaking \nClassification of severity for neuro- and trauma rehab patients \nProject leader: Brigitte Piso  \nResearcher Part 1: Christoph Pammer, Muna Abuzahra  Researcher Part 2: Muna  Abuzahra, Brigitte Piso \nResearcher Part 3: Muna  Abuzahra, Brigitte Piso \nDuration: 09/2008 - 05/2010 \nPartl 1: Instruments used in classifyin g stroke and trauma patients  \nPart 2: International experiences in applyin g classification of severity for \nquality-assurance, performance-assessment and reimbursement \nPart 3 : Status quo in Austria \nPart 1: \nBackground: The evidence that the implementa tion of quality assurance sys-\ntems in neurologic and trauma rehabili tation is able to improve patients\u00b4 \nfunctional health status is low. In dicators for outcome measurement should \nbe assessed - not only for quality assura nce reasons. Neurologic rehabilitation \naims to improve the functional health st atus of patients as well as reintegrat-\ning patients in social participation. Th erefore a variety of instruments for as-\nsessing functional health outcomes, ac tivity and participation of patients \nhave been developed and validate d. The comprehensive and multi-\ndimensional assessment of patients\u00b4 health  status is the basis of allocation \ndecisions and standardised planning in rehabilitation, as well as coming up \nto the patients\u00b4 and the health care pr oviders\u00b4 expectations. The selection of \nappropriate measuring instruments makes significant contributions to im-\nproved patient care and its treatment outcomes. \nThe first part of this project aimed to  identify instruments for classifying \ndisease severity in patients with neurol ogic or trauma rehabilitation and as-\nsess them according to test quality crit eria. As an example, we chose two spe-\ncific diagnostic groups (stroke and traumatic brain injury). \nMethod : We identified 2527 publications by systematic literature search and \nhand search. 167 full text articles met our inclusion criteria and were in-\ncluded in further analyses. \nResults : In stroke patients, specific instrume nts for classifying the severity of \nthe disease show better test quality than  generic instruments. Based on test \nquality criteria, we recommend the Nation al Institute of Health Stroke Scale \n(NIHSS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Frenchay Activities In-\ndex (FAI), the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) and the Stroke Specific Quality of \nLife Scale (SSQOL). In patients with traumatic brain injury specific instru-\nments do not necessarily perform better than generic instruments. We rec-ommend the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) and the Community Integration \nQuestionnaire (CIQ).   \n programme line  1 \npart 1: \ninstruments used in \nclassifying stroke and trauma patients   Annual Report \n2010 \n24 LBI-HTA | 2011 Conclusion:  Instrument selection is not only dependant on test quality (and \nfeasibility and acceptability issues), but also on the purpose the measure-\nments are to serve in the system. Gene ric instruments can be used across dif-\nferent diseases, while additionally othe r criteria have to be assessed disease \nspecific (modular composition of gene ric and disease specific instruments). \nIn order to choose measurement instrume nts for neurological and trauma re-\nhabilitation in Austria, the aims of  measurements have to be defined. \nWhether and in which way measurements  for quality assurance and outcome \nevaluation will be implemented and whether they will be connected to reim-\nbursement needs to be clarified. \nPart 2: \nBackground:  Neurologic and traumatologic rehabilitation are highly complex. \nThe evaluation of quality and performan ce is important in order to meet the \nrequirements of patients, care provide rs and funders of health care. Increased \nefficiency can be achieved by using outcome-oriented payment models. Dif-\nferentiation by severity of disease using generic (overall diagnosis) assess-\nment instruments could be used in qu ality measurement and linked to reim-\nbursement systems. \nMethod:  This report considers whether and which generic assessment in-\nstruments are used in quality and perf ormance measurement, or in determin-\ning levels of reimbursement, in neuro and trauma rehabilitation. In particu-\nlar, it explores international experiences  with such instruments. A systematic \nliterature review and a selective intern et search were conducted in order to \nanswer these questions. \nResults:  In Germany and in Switzerland pi lot studies of generic instruments \nfor quality and performance measuremen t are being conducted. In Australia \nthe AROC (Australasian Rehabilitation  Outcome Centre) carries out quality \nmeasurement in rehabilitation almost  nationwide, and uses the FIM (Func-\ntional Independency Measure). The a pplication of generic instruments in \noutcome orientated payment systems ha s been tested in Germany using the \nFIM and the SINGER (Selbstst\u00e4ndigkei tsindex f\u00fcr die neurologische und \ngeriatrische Rehabilitation). In Swit zerland, the LTR (leistungsorientiertes \nTarifmodell, performance-oriented tariff model) is currently being tested. In \nGreat Britain the RCS (Rehabilitation Complexity Scale), the NPDS (North-\nwick Park nursing Dependency Scal e), and the NPTDA (Northwick Park \nTherapy Dependency Assessment) have b een developed and are currently be-\ning piloted. In Australia the AN-SNAP- Classification (Australian National \nSub-acute and Non-acute Patient Classifi cation System), in which the differ-\nentiation of severity is based on the FI M, has been developed. In the USA the \nFIM has been in use for the differentia tion of severity in the PPS (Prospec-\ntive Payment System) since 2002. Most of the studies reviewed which discuss the use of generic instruments in reim bursement are from the USA. For the \nmost part, they evaluate the PPS. The costs of neuro and trauma rehabilita-\ntion are higher than the level of reim bursement designated by the PPS. Since \nthe implementation of the PPS, the aver age length of stay has decreased and \nrate of discharges to home has increased. \nConclusion : Generic Instruments can be used for various purposes. In Austria, \npilot projects of the use of generic in struments for the measurement of qual-\nity and/or reimbursement, which take into consideration previous interna-\ntional experiences and projects, are recommended. part 2:  \ninternational experience \nin quality and \nperformance evaluation \nand reimbursement Research \nLBI-HTA | 2011 25 Part 3: \nBackground:  Based on the first parts of the project \u201cclassifying disease sever-\nity in patients with neurologic or trau ma rehabilitation\u201d (part 1: instruments \nfor stroke and traumatic brain injury. HTA-Projektbericht 023a; part 2: In-\nternational experiences with quality / performance assessments and reim-\nbursement. HTA-Projektbericht 023b) we aimed to collect status quo data on \nthe usage of generic and specific instrume nts and to identify pilot projects in \nAustrian rehabilitation institutions. Additionally, we wanted to assess opin-ions about the potential and constraints of generic instruments. \nMethods : For data collection we developed a questionnaire and sent it to 20 \nAustrian rehabilitation centers vi a email (response rate 50%).  \nResults : Some instruments (the 10m walk test, the nine-hole-peg-test, the \nBarthel Index/BI, the 2min walk test, the Rankin Scale/RS, the Functional \nAmbulation Categories/FAC, the mini mental state examination/MMSE, the \nexpanded disability status scale/EDSS) are being used in almost all of the \ncentres, most commonly at admission an d/or discharge. Most frequently, \nphysicians, nurses, occupational ther apists, physiotherapists, speech thera-\npists and (neuro-) psycholo gists conduct the assessments. Individual goals \nare arranged with patients in all institutions, but goal attainment is evaluated \nin only about fifty percent of the inst itutions. Key objectives of data collec-\ntion are the documentation of the reha bilitation process and documentation \nfor internal quality management. Over all seven completed or ongoing pilot \nprojects, which test the utilization of measuring instruments or quality as-surance systems, were id entified by the survey. \nDiscussion : The results show that recommend ations of the \u00d6GNR lead to a \nhomogenisation of the instruments used. However, a standardized guidance does not exist and a variety of meas urement instruments continues to be \nused.

The objectiv es are firstly, to evaluate whether \nthe administration of Haemocomplettan\u00ae P and/or Fibrogammin\u00ae P is su-part 3: \nstatus quo in Austria \nprogramme line  1 Annual Report \n2010 \n26 LBI-HTA | 2011 perior to the substitution of fresh fr ozen plasma/Octaplas\u00ae and/or cryopreci-\npitate in acquired hypofibrinogenemia ; secondly, to explore the safety of \nHaemocomplettan\u00ae P and Fibrogammin\u00ae  P; thirdly, to assess whether \nthrombelastometry (ROTEM\u00ae) is superi or in providing information about \ntransfusion requirements compared to st andard laboratory hemostasis tests, \nsuch as the Clauss assay. \nPICO question:  Efficacy and safety of Haemocomplettan\u00ae P and Fibro-\ngammin\u00ae P in acquired hypofibrinogenemia in children and adults com-\npared to FFP and Octaplas\u00ae with special consideration of ROTEM\u00ae point-of-care testing.  \nMethod:  Systematic Review as outlined in  the Internal Manual of the LBI-\nHTA. Results: The evidence for H\u00e4mocomplettan\u00ae P is of poor quality. Thresholds \nand dosages for the substitution of fi brinogen concentrat e remain unclear. \nFurthermore, the inclusion of heterogeneous, highly selective and critically \nill patient populations limits the generalisa bility of results. There is a lack of \nevidence regarding the efficacy and safe ty of Fibrogammin\u00ae P as only one \nstudy exploring these could be identifi ed. No evidence for the combined use \nof H\u00e4mocomplettan\u00ae P and Fibrogammin\u00ae P could be found.  \nConclusion:  In Austria there is an urgent need for national, evidence-based \ntransfusion guidelines. Existing guidelines, namely those of the Austrian So-\nciety for Anaesthesiology, Reanimation and Intensive Medicine, as well as the internal guidelines of an Austrian  University Hosipital are neither evi-\ndence-based nor conform with recent gu idelines from Canada, the United \nKingdom or Germany.  \nPublication : HTA Project report 39 - http://eprints.hta.lbg.ac.at/870  \nEvaluation of diagnostic technologies \u2013 Background, challenges, \nmethods \nProject leader: Anna Nachtnebel \nDuration: 11/2009 \u2013 08/2010 \nBackground: Diagnostic technologies are used to confirm or exclude the pres-\nence of disease or to classify disease. Ultimately, test results should influence \ndiagnostic or therapeutic decisions, re sulting in improved patient-relevant \noutcomes. Because diagnostic tests can also be associated with adverse conse-quences, and because uncritical use ha s led to a considerable impact on \nhealth care expenditure, the identificati on of efficient and effective technolo-\ngies is crucial. In order to ensure a reasonable allocation of resources, evi-\ndence-based principles, as for the evaluati on of interventions, have to be ap-\nplied. In the HTA context, where di agnostics are assessed beyond merely \ntheir efficacy, taking the most import ant consequences for patients and for \nhealth systems into account, unique  methodological challenges exist. \nAims: To give an overview of specific meth odological challenges associated \nwith the evaluation of diagnostic technologies, and to describe the method-ologies used by selected institutions for the assessment of diagnostic tech-\nnologies. Based on these findings, the aim is to develop a potential method for the evaluation of diagnostic technologies relevant to stakeholders.  \nMethods :Unsystematic hand-searches (manuals , guidelines, of selected insti-\ntutions, Scopus, reference lists of releva nt publications) and systematic litera-programme line  1 Research \nLBI-HTA | 2011 27 ture searches of electronic database s (MEDLINE, EMBASE, HTA- database) \nusing Boolean operators, MESH terms (e.g. \u201cdiagnostics\u201d, \u201cevidence-based \nmedicine\u201d) and free text search (e.g . \u201cdiagnostic test\u201d, \u201cmethodology\u201d, \n\u201cevaluation\u201d) to identify problems and methods used for the evaluation of di-\nagnostic technologies. Categorisation of the identified challenges and the de-\nscription of relevant methodological a pproaches of the selected institutions. \nAnalysis and synthesis of these approach es to determine a method relevant to \nhealth systems.  \nResults:  From the decision-makers\u2018 perspective, the most important aspect of \nthe evaluation of a diagnostic test is the assessment of the patient benefit as-\nsociated with it. In order to obtain  patient-relevant outcomes, the conse-\nquences of the subsequent treatment, as well as the test itself, must be taken \ninto account. This may occur directly , in that studies compare the conse-\nquences of resulting treatment with th ose following a comparative test.  Be-\ncause these studies are rare, \u201elinked evid ence\u201c provides the possibility to link \naccuracy studies with efficacy studie s. However, for \u201elinked evidence\u201c a \nrange of methodological characteristics must be taken into account, and sev-\neral criteria fulfilled. Thus diagnost ic accuracy studies may have specific \nmethodological problems, such that the evaluation of their quality requires specific instruments. Furthermore, the poulation of effeciacy studies and ef-\nficacy studies must be comparable an d there must exist a recognised bench-\nmark, which these studies can be linked with.  \nConclusions:  The institutions included in this study also assess diagnostic \ntests primarily based on their patien t benefit and use similar evaluation \nmethods. Favoured evaluation methods include systematic reviews; 3 institu-\ntions made reference to \u201elinked evid ence\u201c. The most frequently mentioned \ninstruments for assessing the methodological quality of diagnostic accuracy \nstudies are QUADAS, the Cochrane checklist and the STARD Statement; \nthe cost-benefit ratio is us ed by 3 organisations.  \nPublication : HTA Projekt report 36 \u2013 http://eprints.hta.lbg.ac.at/898  \nRadiosurgery: Gamma Knife versus adapted linear accelerator \nProject leader: Stefan Mathis Duration: 05/2010 \u2013 09/2010 \nBackground:  I n  a  n u m b e r  o f  d i s e a s e s  o f  t h e brain and associated structures \nthe methods of microsurgery are limited.  In such situations, radiosurgery is \nan option. Radiosurgery is defined as the biological inactivation or destruc-\ntion of intracranial 3D targets by high -precision ionising radiation during a \nsingle session. Radiosurgery is applicable to patients with primary brain/head \ntumours (menigioma, schwannoma, pituit ary adenomas, glioma, melanoma), \nwith brain metastases, vascular malformations and a number of functional diseases (for instance: trigeminal neural gia). There are different forms of ra-\ndiosurgery, including gamma knife, ad apted linear accelerators and proton \nbeam systems. For this assessment we compared two of these \u2013 gamma knife \nand adapted linear accelerator \u2013 with a focus on clinical effectiveness and \ncost. The gamma knife is a radiation device that bundles approximately 200 rays from radioactive sources (cobalt 60) by collimation. The resulting focus \nwith a diameter of a few millimetres is  called isocenter. A patient is treated \nby positioning his head in such a way, that the isocenter an d the patient\u2019s le-\nsion overlap. In this position the patient remains fixed (by a stereotactic frame), until the therapeutic dose is reached according to the dose distribu-programme line  1 Annual Report \n2010 \n28 LBI-HTA | 2011 tion plan. Because of the high dose gr adient (high dose in the centre, low \ndoses in the neighbourhood) the surrounding tissue can be protected from \ndoses above their radiation tolerance le vel. The gamma knife is used for pa-\nthologies of the head with a diameter  of less than 3 centimetres. The com-\nparator in this assessment is an adapted linear accelerator (LINAC). LINAC \nis a radiation device which emits X-rays. In contrast to the gamma knife, the \nadapted linear accelerator has only on e source of rays. This emitter head \nmust therefore be moved around the patient, otherwise (with a single en-trance point) the tolerance of the tissu e in the pathway of the ray would be \nexceeded quickly and, consequently, the th erapeutic target dose in the target \nlesion could not be reached. Moving parts (a complex feature of the LINAC \nsystem) require a vast amount of maintenance and quality control. \nMethod : A systematic search in medica l databases was performed and com-\npleted using hand searching. The syst ematic search strategy included all \nstudies written in English or German. The population inclusion criteria were defined as patients with primary brain tumours, brain metastases, arterio-venous malformations or trigeminal neuralgia. To be considered for inclu-sion, studies had to evaluate gamma knife or LINAC based radiosurgery. \nOnly studies with a high level of qu ality in terms of their study design \n(RCTs, prospective cohort studies) we re included. For the cost comparison \nthe findings from economic literature were analysed and experts interviewed \nabout the market situation and the cost  components of the radiosurgery pro-\ncedure.  \nResults : Out of a total of 742 records only  few clinical studies made state-\nments about the comparison of both me thods. All of them were of low evi-\ndence quality (consequently not meeting the inclusion criteria), therefore no \ndefinite conclusions can be drawn. Three assessments (all from Germany) \nwith a similar pool of study question s to this assessment were identified. \nStatements from those studies indica te that gamma knife and adapted LI-\nNACs have comparable clinical effects. From studies on the dose distribution \na slight advantage in precision for gamma  knife (especially with very small \ntarget volumes) and some advantages in homogeneity for the adapted LINAC \n(in bigger target volumes) are reported. The clinical relevance; however, re-\nmains unclear in terms of prospective controlled studies. A general lack of \nevidence was observed regarding most of  the indications for radiosurgery.  \nAn annual cost comparison was performed. The higher acquisition costs of the gamma knife (~4,000.000 \u20ac) are compensated by its longer life span \n(~20). However, gamma sources need to be replaced every 5-7 years, costing \napproximately 700.000 \u20ac. An adapted linear accelerator costs ~3,000.000 \u20ac \nand has a a life span of ~10 years. Du e to the complexity of a LINAC system, \nmore maintenance, quality control an d therefore personnel resources should \nbe expected. On the other hand, a LINA C system can also be used for non-\nradiosurgical indications, such as frac tionated (more than one session) radia-\ntion or extracranial indications. Other cost factors depend on variables that \nare determined by the local context (e.g.:  intended indications, case numbers, \nexisting equipment and experience). \nConclusion : There are statements from studie s indicating a similar effect of \nboth technologies. However, the strength  of this evidence is low. If both \ntechnologies are available, the dose dist ribution characteristics indicate the \nuse of gamma knife for small lesions (b etter conformity, efficient workflow), \nwhile the adapted LINAC has advantages with bigger volumes (faster, better \ncoverage, homogeneity). Local variable s (consented indications, case num-Research \nLBI-HTA | 2011 29 bers, existing equipment, experience of  personnel) should be carefully evalu-\nated to allow a decision that meets crit eria for efficient patient care. From a \ncost perspective, the LINAC system seems to be more versatile in its use and \ntherefore recommended, when radiosur gery case numbers are small.  \nPublication : HTA Project report 47 - http://eprints.hta.lbg.ac.at/901  \nScreening for Colorectal Cancer.  \nPart 1: Screening-Tests and Project Design \nProject leader: Claudia Wild \nProject author: Nikolaus Patera Duration: 12/2009 \u2013 03/2010, Update December 2010 \nBackground:  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant tumor arising within the \nwalls of the large intestine. Among both men and women CRC was the third \nmost common non-skin cancer and also  the third-highest cause of cancer \ndeaths in the US in 2009. In terms of age-standardized incidence rates, there \nis little difference from one European country to another. CRC has a recog-nizable, protracted pre-malignant stage that  is relatively easy to treat. If the \ndisease is detected early, a person\u2019s chances of survival are considerably \nhigher than if it is detected at a later stage. That is why various forms of screening for CRC have been introd uced in a number of countries. \nAims and research questions:  The Swiss cancer league (Krebsliga Schweiz) re-\nquested a review of the secondary lite rature (health technology assessments, \nsystematic reviews, meta-analyses) on  CRC-screening to inform policy op-\ntions in this area in December 2009,  and an update in November 2010. \nResearch questions:  What screening-tests are avai lable for colorectal cancer? \nWhat are the respective test characterist ics and what are the respective tests\u2019 \nwider implications for a colorectal cancer-screening programme? What ques-\ntions and central aspects are to be cons idered in the context of designing an \norganised population-based screenin g-program for colorectal cancer? \nMethods:  A systematic literature search limited to secondary literature (health \ntechnology assessments, systematic review s of the literature, meta-analyses) \npublished from 1999-2009 was performed in Dec. 2009. This was supple-mented by a small unsystematic search for literature on recent developments \nin molecular screening-test s. An update search for secondary literature was \nperformed in November 2010. \nResults:  Colonoscopy is the final common pa thway of all screening for colo-\nrectal cancer (CRC). For a screening-te st in the (healthy) general population, \ncolonoscopy is invasive and prone to serious complications. Screening-yield \nand rates of complications are strongly dependent on the individual operator. \nNo data is currently available on the impact of CRC-screening on all-cause \nmortality. When considering first-line screening-tests on which to base an \norganized program, the test\u2019s impact on participation is more important than its test-sensitivity.  \nConclusion : CT-colonoscopy, capsule endoscopy and new molecular tests are \nnot yet viable alternatives for use in population-based mass-screening. \nPublication : HTA Project report 41a - http://eprints.hta.lbg.ac.at/873  programme line  1 Annual Report \n2010 \n30 LBI-HTA | 2011 Screening for Colorectal Cancer. Part 2: Health economic evaluations \nand developments of costs \nProject leader: Ingrid Zechmeister \nProject author: Philipp Radlberger, Ingrid Zechmeister Duration: 12/2009 \u2013 03/2010 \nBackground:  During the recent years, several countries have introduced colon \ncancer screening programs. Colon cancer  is not only a very common cancer \nin terms of incidence, but several scr eening technologies exist in addiction to \ncolonoscopy, such as the flexible sigmoi doscopy and tests for identification of \nfecal occult blood. \nAims and research questions:  Together with report 41a this study aims to give \ndecision support on the question of in troduction or/and planning of a colon \ncancer screening program. Therefore it  analyses the available evidence on \ncost-effectiveness and cost planning.  \nThe main research questions are: What  health economic evaluations on co-\nlon cancer screening programs exist an d which screening strategies are more \ncost effective than others/no screenin g? Which cost factors are most impor-\ntant in the planning of colon cancer screening programs? \nMethods:  Based on a systematic literature se arch in databases,  the report in-\ncludes a systematic review on existi ng health economic evaluations (system-\natic reviews and single studies). In addi tion, it answers the question of which \ncost factors are relevant in planning co lon screening and to what extent they \nare dependent on each other. Results:  With costs of about \u20ac10.000,- to \u20ac20.000,- per life year gained, cost-\neffectiveness ratios of the included sc reening strategies (colonoscopy, flexible \nsigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood te sts) seem to be acceptable compared \nto no screening. However, there are so me important limitations in terms of \nunrealistic assumptions about rates of adherence or sensitivity and specific-\nity. The structure of cost plans for co lon cancer screening usually include a \npreparatory phase, the actual screening and a period of re-testing and transfer \ninto therapy. Depending on the screen ing method chosen, there are certain \nfactors which particularly influence ov erall costs. They include the manage-\nment of polyps, the need for additional  colonoscopies to cl arify diagnoses and \nthe rate of adherence. \nConclusion : Based on the evidence available,  the implementation of colon \ncancer screening for an average risk po pulation older than 50 years seems jus-\ntified in terms of cost-effectiveness, as  long as quality assurance is guaran-\nteed. \nPublication : HTA Project report 41b - http://eprints.hta.lbg.ac.at/874  \nImpact from HTA-research for th e Austrian health care system \nProject leader: Ingrid Zechmeister \nProject team: Ines Schumacher, Ingrid Zechmeister  Durationt: 01/2010 \u2013 12/2010 \nPart 1:  Methodological overview \u2013update  \nPart 2:  Results of the empirical survey  \nBackground:  In Austria research in HTA ha s been conducted since the 1990s. \nInitially, this was lead by the Instit ute of Technology Assessment at the Aus-\ntrian Academy of Sciences. Since the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for HTA programme line 1 \nprogramme line  1 Research \nLBI-HTA | 2011 31 was established in 2006, the importance of HTA research has increased con-\nsiderably. Research in HTA aims to support an adequate and efficient use of \nhealth care resources in order to sust ain a publicly financed and solitary \nhealth care system. Research results should provide independent information for decision makers. In the long run, HTA should improve the health care system (structures, processes, outcomes ) and should result in improved popu-\nlation health in Austria. In order to legitimise further research resources and \nto prioritise future HTA research and guarantee the value of future research, \nHTA research itself needs to undergo evaluation. \nAims and research questions: To identify adequate me thods for measuring the \nimpact of HTA in Austria on the basis of existing literature (part 1)and to \napply a mix of quantitative and qualitative measures in order to evaluate the impact of  HTA in Austria (part 2). \nMethods part 1: Summary of the existing meth ods for measuring HTA impact \nin terms of definition of HTA impact  + indicators and evaluation methods.  \nExpert workshop (LBI HTA, UMIT, DI MDI, and University of Bielefeld): \ndefining an appropriate evaluation design for an empirical analysis in Aus-\ntria. Definition of evaluation tools to be applied in the empirical analysis \n(which followed in part 2).  \nResults part 1: A literature review that addresses the methods of measuring \nimpact from HTA research has been co nducted. The report concludes with a \nframework for measuring the impact of HTA in Austria that is based on pre-\nvious work by A. Gerhardus, which was a basis for structuring the empirical work as well as an analytical framework for data analysis. Within the frame-work, impact is classified into 7 cate gories: awareness, acceptance, policy \nprocess, policy decision, practice, fi nal outcomes, and enlightenment. Fur-\nthermore, different levels of impact (micro, meso, macro) and different target groups are addressed. \nMethods part 2:  On the basis of the existing framework (part 1), the empirical \nanalysis was conducted in part 2 of the project. A mixture of qualitative and \nquantitative research methods was applie d to evaluate the impact within tar-\nget groups at different levels of the heal th care system. Impact is evaluated in \nterms of seven categories (mentioned above). The latter means the general in-\ntroduction of an \u2018HTA culture\u2019 in re search processes, media reporting and \ndecision making. To address these multiple categories we undertook semi-structured interviews among users, a download analysis, an economic analy-sis and a print-media analysis and we developed a questionnaire which was used among the LBI-HTA staff. \nResults part 2: The impact regarding the cate gories awareness, acceptance, \npolicy process, decision making, pr actice, final outcomes and \"enlighten-\nment\" was analyzed using a combination of qualitative and quantitative \nmethods. Due to the different method s employed, such as questionnaires, \ndiscourse analysis, economic analysis, in terviews and download analysis, it \nwas possible to detect both the impact within the different levels of the health system and the various eff ects arising from HTA research.  \nConclusion : The impact of HTA can be detected in all levels of the health care \nsystem. Research results are mainly used  for decisions at the meso (hospital \nassociations) and microlevel (government)  of the health care system. A multi-\ndimensional impact of HTA within all categories can be confirmed, which is still expandable. A lack of impact is strongly linked to external factors (e.g. lack of commitment among decision make rs, counter-lobbies). Research that Annual Report \n2010 \n32 LBI-HTA | 2011 is closely linked to the decision making  process in terms of content and time \nframe, standardised inclusion of HTA in decision making processes and re-\nsource flexibility have been identified as the strongest drivers for future im-\npact. \nPublications: \nPart 1: HTA Project report 37a - http://eprints.hta.lbg.ac.at/877  \nPart 2: HTA Project report 37b - http://eprints.hta.lbg.ac.at/907  \nEconomic aspects of clinically e ffective and efficient models of \nhealth services in alcohol addiction treatment \nProject leader: Philipp Radlberger  Duration: 10/2007 \u2013 04/2010  \nPart 1: International models and approach es to outcome measurement (com-\npleted) \nPart 2: Selected models of integrated care  and their evaluation (completed) \nPart 3: Comparison of services and cost s in practical context: economic \nanalysis of therapeutic institutions in Traun and Kalksburg (ongoing) \nBackground: Increasingly, psychiatric and so cio-medical therapeutic institu-\ntions have to deal with the discussion and measurement of their outcomes. \nGiven this fact, the project, which is st ructured in three parts, aims to pro-\nduce a synthesis of published knowledge and its analysis in order to gain new knowledge for concrete evaluations of th erapeutic institutions. Several highly \nheterogeneous approaches exist in the or ganisation of the services: easily ac-\ncessible out-patient therapies, day-care, as  well as in-patient services. There is \nrelatively little comparative evidence of clinical effectiveness of the different \napproaches, treatment results and costs. \nAims and research objectives:  To give an overview of the different treatment \nmodels, to analyse some models of inte grated care, to reach conclusions about \nthe evaluation of cost-effectiveness anal ysis of in- and out-patient therapies \nfor people suffering from alcohol addictio n, to transfer the main features of a \nmodel of integrated care services to th e region of Salzburg and to carry out an \neconomic evaluation of the existing an d a potential integrated care model. \nMethods:  \nPart 1:  Systematic review, literature- and data analysis; \nPart 2: Additional search of published and grey literature; hand search and \ninternet research for chosen models of  good practice; direct contact and ex-\npert interviews; systematic organisation analysis of the three examples of in-\ntegrated care according to their pro cedural design, gateway communication \nstructures; analysis of grey literature and cost data available; formulation of \nquality indicators which could be benchm arks for other models of integrated \ncare in alcohol addiction treatment; \nPart 3: Expert (group-) interviews, clinical and cost data description, cost-\nconsequence analysis: description of actu al structure of financing, definition \nof outcome parameters in clinical records,  description of cost data, identifica-\ntion of successful treatment in clinic al records, cost-consequence analysis. \nResults:   \nPart 1: Typologies of diagnosis and treatment planning are internationally \nincoherent.

According to the model of service sup-ply, in-patient, out-patient or day care settings are chosen. Case management approaches implying individual carers helping with organising and coordi-nating flexible treatment structures st and in opposition to  treatment strate-\ngies where therapy plans are strictly fixed and scheduled immediately after \ndiagnosis. In addition to evidence of clinical effectiveness, economic argu-\nments can also influence the structures of  health service supply. The fact that \nmost countries are initiating screenin g programs indicates that the economic \nimportance of prevention is increasingly  recognised. From an organisational \npoint of view, general practitioners as gatekeepers can be considered key ac-tors. \nPart 2: The comparison of three projects on integrated care (combination of \nin- and out-patient treatments) was co nducted on three levels: structure, \nprocesses and results. The \u201caddiction therapy in a linked system/EVS\u201d cen-\ntres the gateway management of institutional elements as a key quality indi-\ncator for the system by introducing a communication matrix. The evaluation \nof the Jellinek-model uses an adapted quality management tool for enter-prises. The UKATT, a big RCT with an economic piggyback-design, put the focus on clinical outcome parameters. However, all the study authors consid-\nered the retention rate to be highly relevant. \nDiscussion:  Overall there are many well eval uated single interventions, but \nonly very few coordinated models of in tegrated alcohol therapy. Those that \ndo exist are mostly recent, which explains  the lack of evidence in the field of \nquality measurement. The analysis of a few regional pilot projects shows the \nhigh explanatory relevance of gateway management and retention rate for the \noverall quality of a treatment system in alcohol addiction. \nPublication (Part 1 and 2):   \nHTA Project report 10 - http://eprints.hta.lbg.ac.at/823 / \nEvaluations of child and adolescent psychiatry\n \nProject leader: Roman Winkler (overall project,  clinical evaluations of project part 1 \nand applied evaluation research of project part 2),  Philipp Radlberger (economic \nevaluation of project part 1),   \nIngrid Zechmeister (economic evaluation of project part 2) \nPart 1:  Clinical and economic evaluations of  child and adolescent psychiatry \n(completed).

However, in the context of therapeutic evaluations and quality as-\nsurance, there is a lack of evidence re garding therapeutic outcomes (such as \nclinical improvements, quality of life) and satisfaction rates of patients and their relatives concerning therapy care. Additionally, there is a need for long-term socio-economic outcomes assessing parameters such as school success or \nthe working ability of mentally diso rdered children and adolescents. Re-\nsearch also needs to focus on economic evaluations, which relate therapy out-programme line  1 Annual Report \n2010 \n34 LBI-HTA | 2011 comes to resource management. In Austri a, applied evaluation research is \nstill in its early stages. Hence, this co-o peration shall inter alia contribute to \nimprove the Austrian data on quality evaluations. \nAims and research questions part 1:  The first part of the project aimed to pro-\nvide a systematic literature review rega rding evaluation methods, to identify \napplied evaluation instruments and to analyse systematically therapy out-\ncomes such as clinical symtomatology, health-related life quality, patients\u2019 satisfaction rates, long-term socio-eco nomic outcomes and the cost effective-\nness of treatments. The overall aim was to identify adequate benchmarks for \nthe Austrian context. \nHence, project part 1 was based on the following research questions: \n\uf062 Which evaluation indicators and which methods and instruments \nhave been used to evaluate trea tment programmes for mentally dis-\nordered children and adolescents within the international context? \n(HTA project report number 27). \n\uf062 Which therapy outcomes have been identified so far and which ones \ncan be identified as benchmarks for the Austrian context? Which \nlong-term socio-economic outcomes have been empirically ana-lysed? (HTA project report number 27). \n\uf062 Which costs, cost-effectiveness ratios  and cost-benefit analyses have \nbeen documented in economic eval uations? (HTA project report \nnumber 28). \nMethods part 1:  Systematic literature search of  studies/reports in medical por-\ntals (Ovid Medline, Embase, CRD data bases, PsycINFO, EconLit, ISI Web \nof Science), period 1985-2009; hand search; analysis; systematic literature re-view. \nResults part 1:  \nClinical findings: The systematic review showed  the therapeutic outcome, \ntreatment satisfaction and the health-rel ated quality of life of the patients \nturned out to be the primary evaluati on dimensions. Evaluation indicators \nhave been developed for the purpose of  defining these dimensions. In this \ncontext, the clinical symptomatology was identified as a core indicator for \nmedical, psychotherapeutic and psyc ho-social treatment programmes. The \nquality of the treatment process as well as the \u201ccommunication culture\u201d \namong the involved actors, were proposed as adequate evaluation aspects. This also linked to health-related qual ity of life issues focusing even more \nstrongly on the assessement of the pa tient\u2019s own human resources. In most \ncases, standardised empirical instrume nts were used to measure the evalua-\ntion indicators. The \u201cMARSYS\u201d system wa s of particular interest because of \nits comprehensive view of aspects releva nt to treating mentally disordered \nchildren and adolescents. Regarding the study results, study authors of the \nselected publications widely report significant improvements in terms of the clinical symptoms. Regarding the \u201csucce ss factors\u201d related to improved clini-\ncal outcomes, the building of \u201csustainable relationships\u201d during the course of treatment appears to be core for the in itiation of \u201csuccessful\u201d treatments.  \nEconomic findings: Over a period of 25 years, one systematic review and 25 \nsingle evaluations could be identified . Some indications, e.g. ADHD, have \nbeen more frequently studied than others. Regarding different interventions, there is disequilibrium in favour of fa mily therapy interven tions. Most of the \nevaluations are cost-effectiveness stud ies. Results suggest that the cost-Research \nLBI-HTA | 2011 35 effectiveness of the interventions assesse d is low, compared to interventions \nevaluated in somatic medicine. Most of the studies identified are inade-\nquately transparent, especially with rega rd to information on cost data collec-\ntion and modelling. The transferabilit y of the evidence is limited because \nstudies looked at context specific interv entions. As for the collection of cost \ndata, most studies take a public paye rs\u2019 or insurance company perspective. \nFurther to this, there are instruments, such as the \u2018Client Service Receipt In-\nventory\u2019, which do not only cover expens es incurred within the public health \nsystem, but also other public or private costs. \nAims and research questions part 2:  On the basis of these \u201ctheoretical reflec-\ntions\u201d on clinical and economic evaluation  studies, further research activities \nwill take place in co-operation with th e University Department of Child and \nAdolescent Psychiatry at the Christ ian-Doppler-Clinic (Salzburg) from \nMarch 2010 onwards. This forthcoming project part 2 pursues the aim to \nmake use of those therapy outcomes that  turned out to be adequate and use-\nful (according to the systematic reviews) in order to evaluate treatment pro-grammes in Salzburg.  \nThe following research questions will gu ide the research in project part 2: \n\uf062 Which clinically relevant changes and developments show children \nand adolescents who make use of the treatment programmes offered \nby the University Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Christian-Doppler-Clinic (Salzburg)? \n\uf062 Which resources have been used before and during the hospital \nstay?

Since then, the spectrum of examinations has been steadily \nextended and the number of examinatio ns has continuously increased. How-\never, to date, neither the programme itself nor recently emerging needs have been systematically evaluated. An eval uation of the Austrian mother-child-\npass examination programme primarily ai ms to analyse the specific needs of \nthe target population in terms of the breadth and depth of both existing ser-\nvices and new/ different services requir ed, as well as challenging the evidence \nbase of existing examinations. \nThe mother-child-pass examination prog ramme is a classical (epidemiologi-\ncal) screening programme among healthy individuals. However, WHO crite-\nria for screening should be applied. Currently, the mother-child-pass exami-\nnation programme comprises of examinat ions of both the pregnant mother, \nfrom the point of detection of pregnanc y until delivery, and the child, from \nbirth up to the 62nd month of life. The current mother-child-pass is pre-\ndominantly \u201cmedicine-focussed\u201d and more  or less excludes diagnostic proce-\ndures/ care provided by health professionals other than doctors, such as midwives, nurses, physiotherapists, psyc hologists, social workers, besides \nothers. However, this contrasts with more recent regional / national and in-\nternational screening models targeting primarily at-risk populations (e.g. so-\ncially deprived women and children, women and children with a migration \nbackground etc.) that have special need s related to mother-child health care \nservices.  \nProgram services have mainly been publ icly financed by several public pay-\ners. Additionally, different incentive systems have been introduced to in-\ncrease uptake of services. In order to establish a system of care that meets \ncurrent needs, adequate financing st ructures, among other things, are re-\nquired. \nAim of the overall project: The aim is the developmen t of a decision support \ndocument for the re-orientation of th e mother-child prevention programme \nin Austria. It aims to ease the re-org anisation process for stakeholders in or-\nder to adjust the prevention programme to the actual needs of the relevant \ntarget population.  \nObjectives: \n\uf062 Part 1:  A synthesis and analysis of epidemiological data concerning \nexisting risk factors and diseases in defined target-groups aims to \nhighlight the spectrum of risk fact ors and diseases, including their \nfrequency. It should provide the ba sis for the assessment of services \nrequired.  \n\uf062 Part 2:  The second part will cover a comparative analysis focussing \non similar screening-instruments in  the international context \u2013 on \nthe one hand, this shall involve experiences relating to particular \nservices provided for risk populati ons, as well as, on the other hand, \nother innovative services aspects for mother-child health.  \n\uf062 Part 3:  Part three will describe the financing structures (payers, \nmonetary flows, transfer of servi ces), the inherent incentives as well \nas costs and expenditure of current services (mother-child-pass ex-Research \nLBI-HTA | 2011 37 aminations and other preventive measures for pregnant women, \nnewborns and children). \n\uf062 Part 4:  Based on the results of parts 1-3 we aim to assess the actual \nneeds in terms of services required. \nMethods:  \n\uf062 Part 1:  Systematic literature search  in the following databases: \nCRD-INAHTA, Embase, Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, The Cochrane Library, We b of Science und MedPilot; Hand search \nin databases, selected medical jo urnals, committees of professional \nsocieties, HTA-institutions ; Synthesis of statistical data from Aus-\ntria (Statistik Austria, birth registr y, health reports) concerning dis-\neases/ risk-factors/ risky behaviour ; Comparison of assessed statisti-\ncal data with the current mother -child-pass examination programme \nconcerning examinations/ missing examinations/ lacking data ; \nWorkshop with national experts  \n\uf062 Part 2 : Internet search on public sect or information; Systematic lit-\nerature search and hand search in  databases; Questionnaire; Com-\nparative analysis of internatio nal screening-instruments and ser-\nvices; Workshop with national experts  \n\uf062 Part 3: Evaluation of public documents on financing structures and \nlegal frameworks; Interviews with payer representatives to gain ad-\nditional information; Analysis of costs and expenditure based on administrative data (e.g. from soci al security funds and hospitals, \nministry) and on secondary literature  \n\uf062 Part 4: Synthesis of results of parts 1-3; Comparison of contents/ fi-\nnancial structure of the current ma ternity and child care programme \nwith identified risks and international approaches \nStrengthening the knowledge base for a better health system in Austria: \nInspirations from abroad for capacity  building in health services and pub-\nlic health research  \nProject leader: Claudia Wild Project team: Nikolaus Patera Duration: 06/2010 \u2013 01/2011 \nBackground:  Important sectors of society re quire specific knowledge for goal \noriented organisational activity. This is  particularly relevant for the complex \nfield of public health and health care. Health Services and Public Health re-\nsearch can develop such knowledge and offer it to policymakers and practice. \nAims and research objectives: This project strives to enable learning from good-\npractice examples of capacity building in the areas of health services and \npublic health research. Specific organisa tions abroad which work in this field \n(e.g. Institutes of Public Health, Instit utes for Health Services Research, Sci-\nentific Advisory Councils, Research-commissioning Institutions) and their interactions with policy makers and practice are to inspire the Austrian \nsituation. The following research  questions should be answered: \n\uf062 Theoretical questions:  What sort of knowledge base is necessary for \ndeveloping health systems? What does the interaction between re-search and policy look like? What kind of institutions, which corre-programme line  1 Annual Report \n2010 \n38 LBI-HTA | 2011 sponding organisational culture, wh ich work processes, what sort of \nnetworks and which financial investments into additional resources \ncan help facilitate this research \u2013 policy interaction? \n\uf062 International good practice: How do selected countries with potential \nrole model characteristics for Aust ria structure their relevant insti-\ntutions?  \n\uf062 Recommendations for Austria: Taking clues from the literature on \nknowledge generation and transfer and integrating aspects of good practice institutions abroad, what profile results for an Austrian \n\u201cInstitute of Health Services an d Public Health Research\u201d? What \nshould its organisational cultur e look like? According to which \nprocesses should it work? What resources are necessary? What can \nAustria do to aid capacity building  in health services and public \nhealth research? Which processe s for commissioning research, for \ninter-institutional networking and exchange in the debate over pol-icy relevant research issues, whic h mechanisms for research evalua-\ntion and which steps towards bridgin g the research \u2013 policy divide \nare desirable? \nMethods: Non-systematic hand search for literature on the relevant knowl-\nedge base for health care systems, on ca pacity building in health services and \npublic health research and on the rese arch \u2013 policy interaction; Internet \nsearch on homepages of institutions potentially representing good-practice (organizational structure, resources, work processes, research output); Semi \nstructured expert interviews with in stitutions and stakeholders from the \nrelevant organizational environment in selected countries via telephone.  \nMeasuring disease \u2013 Patient-relevant outcomes versus surrogate out-\ncomes \nProject leader: Anna Nachtnebel \nDuration: 09/2010 \u2013 04/2011 (Part 1); 05/2011 \u2013 NN (Part 2) \nBackground: Health technologies should eventually lead to improvements in \npatient-relevant outcomes, defined as \u201ca  measure of how a patient feels, func-\ntions or survives\u201d. Nevertheless, becaus e surrogate outcomes are more readily \navailable and often easier to measure they  are increasingly used as substitutes \nfor clinically relevant endpoints. Cons ensus exists that only validated surro-\ngates should serve as substitutes for patient relevant outcomes, but despite \nthis claim, the literature is someho w patchy regarding which surrogates are \ncommonly accepted and valid endpoints and therefore constitute outcome \nmeasures eligible for licensing or reimbursement decisions. Accordingly, HTA agencies often face the problem, es pecially with regards to new tech-\nnologies, that only sparse data on patient-relevant outcomes are available. This might result in either the incorporation of endpoints with unknown relevance to the technology\u2019s actual bene fits and risks into assessments, or in \nthe exclusion of studies without patient-relevant outcomes, which might bear the risk of loosing a great deal of information. This poses the question whether a catalogue of widely accepte d and validated surrogate parameters \ncan be formulated to facilitate incorp oration of surrogate outcomes in HTA \nreports.    \n  programme line 1 Research \nLBI-HTA | 2011 39 Aims part 1: \n\uf062 To elicit methodological consider ations and requirements necessary \nfor the validation of surrogate outcomes.  \n\uf062 To clarify if the composition of a catalogue (preferably arranged ac-\ncording to groups of diseases) with  validated surrogate parameters is \npossible and feasible.  \nResearch questions part 1: Which instruments are available to measure disease \n(patient reported vs observer rated ou tcomes, generic vs disease specific in-\nstruments)?  What are the definitions for patient-relevant outcomes and sur-\nrogate outcomes?  Which criteria have a parameter to fulfil in order to serve \nas a valid surrogate?  Which methods can be used to  establish validity of sur-\nrogates?  What do the methodological guidelines of HTA/licensing institu-\ntions (FDA, EMA) state on using surroga tes to assess clinical benefit? What \nare the context specific circumstances wh ich justify use of surrogates as pri-\nmary outcomes in clinical trials? Can these circumstances be used to derive \nmore general recommendations on wh en surrogates might be justified?  Is the \nvalidation of surrogates disease-specifi c (including dependency on line of \ntherapy as in cancer drugs), techno logy specific or can commonly accepted \nsurrogates be established which are vali d for broader groups of indications?  \nMethods part 1: Systematic literature search; Unsystematic search (Home-\npages of licensing (FDA, EMA) and HTA institutions, reference lists of rele-\nvant articles, gray literature) \nAims part 2 (dependent on findings of part 1): \n\uf062 To compile a catalogue of valid su rrogates for indications most rele-\nvant to the LBI-HTA; \n\uf062 In-depth discussion of  underlying methodology/problems associated \nwith measuring disease for these in dications,, e.g. patient-reported \noutcomes versus observer reported, generic measures vs disease spe-\ncific measures;  \nPreliminary research questions part 2: Which groups of diseases are most often \nsubject to assessments conducted by the LBI-HTA?  What are the methodo-\nlogical difficulties associated with measuring either surrogates or clinically relevant outcomes for these diseases?  Which surrogates are commonly used \nas outcome measures for these diseases?  Is there evidence available or can \nevidence be generated that these surrogates are valid?  \nPreliminary methods part 2: Analysis of LBI-HTA a ssessments according to \ndisease group, indication, technology assessed, outcome parameters consid-ered; Discussion of outcome parameters for interventions/diseases by indi-\nvidual researchers of the LBI-HTA, including consideration of patient-\nrelevant outcomes versus surrogates, patient-reported versus observer rated outcomes, available instruments (gener ic vs disease specific instruments). \nTopics might include: (paediatric and juvenile) psychiatry interventions, re-habilitation programmes, back pain, ca ncer therapies and cardiovascular dis-\nease; Un-/systematic literature search (this might comprise systematic review \non specific parameters and/or diseases/indications, unsystematic search in HTA databases). Annual Report \n2010 \n40 LBI-HTA | 2011 Hyperthermia  \nProject leader: Stefan Mathis \nDuration: 12/2009 \u2013 07/2010 \nBackground: Hyperthermia is an intervention  that uses microwaves to heat \ntarget tissue up to 41-45\u00b0 Celsius. In clinical studies hyperthermia is evalu-\nated as supplementary tumour therapy in combination with radiation ther-\napy or chemotherapy is certain tumo ur stadiums. A comprehensive German \nassessment from 2005 (commissioned by the Federal Joint Committee of the \nGerman Health Care System \u2013 GB-A) concluded from their summary of the \nevidence, that hyperthermia is not recommended for routine use. The cur-\nrent assessment summarises the evidence after the 2005 German review for 11 (promising) tumour indications and evaluates whether the status of evi-\ndence has changed since then.  \nMethod: Medical databases and Health Technology Assessment databases \nwere systematically searched for studie s that evaluate hyperthermia. The se-\nlection process was based on predefined inclusion criteria and is documented \nusing a PRISMA Flowchart. For all studies the quality of evidence was as-sessed. Finally the evidence from the studies was summarised based on par-\nticular outcomes (using the GRADE me thod). This was the basis for a rec-\nommendation for current use.  \nResults:  6 RCTs and a long-term follow up  o f  a n  R C T  w e r e  i n c l u d e d .  N o  \nother prospective controlled studies coul d be identified. The studies report \nthe application of hyperthermia within the following indications: rectal car-\ncinoma (1 study and 1 long term outcome), breast cancer (1 study), cervical \ncarcinoma (1 study), melanoma/superfici al (2 studies) tumours and anal tu-\nmours (1 study). The quality of the co llective evidence is moderate to low, \nbecause there was predominantly only one study per indication and the ma-jority of the studies had limitations. The majority of the studies do not show a benefit for the endpoints survival or quality of life. A few studies show an \nadvantage in the endpoint local control,  but this term was defined inconsis-\ntently and some criticisms exist as to  whether the measurement of local con-\ntrol is convincing. Other studies show a clear negative effect of additional \nhyperthermia. The majority of studies re port a high rate of acute toxicity.  \nDiscussion:  The results of studies assessing su rvival and quality of life do not \nshow a benefit of hyperthermia. The resu lt from local control based outcomes \nshow a heterogeneous picture and there re levance for patients is partially un-\nclear. Acute side effects are reported frequently where hyperthermia is ap-\nplied. The collective evidence is too limited to conclude a beneficial effect for patients. Results of new Phase III studies are that may strengthen the evi-dence for hyperthermia are expected shortly. \nConclusion:  The use of hyperthermia can no t be generally recommended, be-\ncause the strength of the evidence (on time  of this assessment) is too weak to \nconclude a net benefit. Hyperthermia should therefore only be applied \nwithin clinical studies.  \nPublication : Decision Support Document 36 - http://eprints.hta.lbg.ac.at/883  \n \n programme line 2: \npolicy advice/ Decision \nSupport Documents  Research \nLBI-HTA | 2011 41 Evaluation of individual medical services (MELs)  \nProject leader: Claudia Wild, Philipp Mad \nDuration: 01/2010 \u2013 04/2010 \nBackground:  Each year, the Austrian Ministry  of Health receives suggestions \nfor numerous new medical interventions to be reimbursed.

Evidence for the effect iveness of KP and VP under routine \ncare conditions is low. Predictive fa ctors for a clinically relevant outcome \nhave not been identified yet.  Aims & methods : Aim of the study was to identify predictive factors for the \nlongterm success of both procedures. A dditionally safety data (e.g. subse-\nquent, adjacent fractures, cement leak ages) were collected. Moreover it \nshould be examined, if the interventi ons were able to reduce the kyphotic \nangle and if this reduction was related to clinical outcome parameters. A pro-\nspective cohort study was chosen as st udy design. The expected sample size \nwas not reached. Because of low data quality (sample at the beginning n = \n88, at the second medical examinatio n n = 38 and heterogeneous observation \nperiods) and between groupsdifferences in baseline characteristics we con-\nducted a descriptive analysis.  \nResults : The groups (KP, VP) differed in ba seline characteristics (e.g. spon-\ntaneous vs. traumatic fractu re, osteoporosis, Oswestry  Disability Index). We \nobserved cement leakages in both groups , but none of them required further \nintervention. Oswestry Disability Index improved by an average of 50 points \nafter KP and by 37 points after VP. Pa in was reduced by 67 VAS points in \nthe KP-group and 61 VAS points in th e VP-group. The pain reduction and \nthe improvement in the ODI score was sustained with minimal losses until \nthe end of the observation period after two years.  Discussion : This observational study shows th at KP and VP were able to im-\nprove functionality and to reduce pain under routine care conditions. Be-\ncause of between group differences in ba seline characteristics direct compari-\nsion of outcomes was not feasible. Because of study limitations not all re-search questions could be fully answered.  \nConclusion : Results of currently conducte d randomised controlled trials \nshould be followed. Patients should be included in registries and informed \nabout expected benefits and harms prior to both interventions.  \nPublication : HTA Project report 25 - http://eprints.hta.lbg.ac.at/900/ \nOutpatient Cardiac Rehabilitation \u2013  \nPart 3:  Retrospective cohort study (with/ without phase III rehabilitation)  \nProject leader: Brigitte Piso  \nProject team: Michael Gyimesi, Brigitte Piso, Heinz T\u00fcchler Duration: 10/2008 \u2013 04/2010 \nPart 3a:  Explorative analysis and developing of an evaluation plan  \nPart 3b:  Application of the evaluation plan \nBackground:  Cardiac rehabilitation is an essential therapeutic step in ensur-\ning patient reintegration into work-, so cial- and family life following acute \ncardiac incidents or cardiac surgical procedures. Phase I of the cardiac reha-\nbilitation is conducted in inpatients in  terms of early mobilisation after an \nacute incident. The phase II cardiac reha bilitation normally takes 4-6 weeks programme line  4 \nprogramme line  4 Annual Report \n2010 \n52 LBI-HTA | 2011 and in many countries this is performe d on an outpatient basis. In Austria \nonly a small number of cardiac patients  participate in outpatient rehabilita-\ntion programs. However, the outpatient cardiac rehabilitation is assumed to \nbe as effective and safe as inpatient re habilitation care and in addition is \nmore cost-effective. Phase III is always conducted on an outpatient basis and \nshould support the sustainabi lity of the rehabilitation. \nIn 2008, the first two parts of this pr oject (\u201coutpatient cardiac rehabilita-\ntion\u201d) were finished. The objective, on  the one hand, was to identify indica-\ntors and methods which are suitable fo r the formative and summative evalua-\ntion of outpatient cardia c rehabilitation, and on th e other hand, to conduct a \ncomparative analysis of various rehabilitation models of Phase II as well as an analysis of the efficacy of phase III interventions.  \nAims and research objectives:  Because of the observed great heterogeneity of the \nprograms in regard to the contents and models of rehabilitation we suggested \nthe evaluation of Austrian phase III rehabilitation programs to prove their ef-\nfectiveness. Therefore a retrospective cohort study based on clinical data \nfrom patients who attended cardiac re habilitation centres  and account data \nfrom health insurance institutions was planned. \nThe first objective was the estimation of  the effectiveness of outpatient car-\ndiac phase III rehabilitation. The second objective was to give decision guid-\nance for the Association of Austrian Health Insurance Providers for negotia-tions concerning the prolongation of contacts between them and outpatient \nrehabilitation centers.  \nMethods : In a first step we developed an evaluation concept based on the \nanalysis of the centre for outpatient rehabilitation (ZAR) owned by the Pen-\nsion Insurance institution (HTA Project report No. 31a). In a second step we \napplied the concept to the centers of th e working group on outpatient cardiac \nprevention and rehabilita tion (AGAKAR) - (HTA Pr oject report No. 31b).  \nPublications (Part 1, 2, 3a, 3b):  HTA Project report 15 (Part 1+ 2/2008): http://eprints.hta.lbg.ac.at/800/ \nHTA Project report 31a (Part 3a/2010): http://eprints.hta.lbg.ac.at/875/  \nHTA Project report 31b (Part 3b/2010): http://eprints.hta.lbg.ac.at/876/  \nOutpatient cardiac rehabilitation -  Part 4: Development of a study protocol for a prospective, controlled study to assess the effectiven ess of phase III rehabilitation\n \nProject leader: Brigitte Piso Project team: Brigitte Piso, Heinz T\u00fcchler Duration: 04/2010 \u2013 06/2010 \nBackground:  The current project is based on three already completed parts of \nthe project \u201cOutpatient cardiac rehabili tation\u201d: The objective of the first \nparts was to identify indicators as we ll as appropriate methods or instru-\nments which are suitable for the format ive and summative evaluation of out-\npatient cardiac rehabilitation (HTA Project report No. 15). Further objec-\ntives were to to conduct a comparativ e analysis of various rehabilitation \nmodels of phase II as well as an analysis of the efficacy of phase III interven-\ntions (HTA Project report No. 31a and HTA Project report No. 31b). We ob-served a great heterogeneity regarding th e contents and models of rehabilita-\ntion. Beyond that, the results of published phase III cardiac rehabilitation trials or international field reports co uld not be transferred to the national programme line 4 Research \nLBI-HTA | 2011 53 health care system directly. Therefor e we conducted a retrospective cohort \nstudy, based on clinical data from pa tients who attended cardiac rehabilita-\ntion centres, and account data from heal th insurance institutions. Because of \nthe non-randomised retrospective study design, which could not safeguard \nagainst systematic differences between groups, the limited data quality and the considerable proportion of missing da ta, the estimation of effectiveness of \noutpatient cardiac phase III rehabilitation was not feasible. A spin-off effect of the project was that it highlighted possibilities and pitfalls of evaluating routine data. These results will be us ed for planning a prospective study \nevaluating the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation. \nObjectives - Planning phase: Agreement between all partners on study objec-\ntives (research questions, study des ign, endpoints\u2026); Considerations con-\ncerning feasibility (especially: data availability and quality) Objectives \u2013 Study : To assess the effectiveness of  Austrian outpatient cardiac \nphase III rehabilitation; to provide d ecision-making guidance to the Associa-\ntion of Austrian Health Insurance Prov iders for negotiations concerning the \nprolongation of contacts between them and outpatient rehabilitation centres \nof the working group on outpatient ca rdiac prevention and rehabilitation \n(AGAKAR) Methods: Development of the study protocol; Draft of the protocol, which \noutlines different options (e.g. different research questions, study endpoints) \nwill be discussed (and finally approved) by a project group, consisting of LBI-HTA-members, members of the HVB and the pension insurance insti-tution as well as the AGAKAR; Prospective study (starting in autumn 2010), study options to be discussed  \nHorizon Scanning in Oncology \u2013 From pilot to routine \nProject leader: Anna Nachtnebel Project team: Anna Nachtnebel, Katharina Hintringer Duration: regularly from 10/2008  \nBackground:  The first part of our project \"Horizon Scanning in Oncology\", \nwhich was carried out between July 2007 and May 2008 focused on the devel-\nopment of a concept for a Horizon Scanni ng System in onco logy and the test-\ning of two important steps (i.e., \"identif ication\" and \"prioritisation\") in the \ncontext of a short pilot. On the whole our initial experiences with the Hori-\nzon Scanning System from the feasibil ity study were acceptable but several \nchanges, especially regarding the collect ion of data on anticancer drugs and \nthe priority setting process, were prop osed by the experts involved. Based on \nthese findings, an optimised final con cept has been developed with various \nstakeholders (e.g. hospital administrators, clinical experts, drug commis-sions). \nAims and research objectives:  Since the development of an optimised and final \nconcept in automn 2009, the Horizon Scanning System has made standard \npractice at the LBI-HTA to regularly provide Austrian hospitals (hospital \nmanagement and drug commissions) wi th information (assessments) about \nnew/ emerging anticancer drugs to suppo rt their financial drug budget plan-\nning and rational decision making.  Methods : Weekly scanning of information so urces with data extraction, quar-\nterly prioritization process through an interdisciplinary oncology team of ex-\nperts, writing assessments for releva nt cancer drugs under development programme line  4 Annual Report \n2010 \n54 LBI-HTA | 2011 (\"emerging anti-cancer drugs), disseminati on of these reports and the evalua-\ntion of the Horizon Scanning Programme  after a certain start-up phase.  \nMembers of the interdisciplinary oncology team of experts are: \n\uf062 Dr. Anna BUCSICS , Hauptverband der \u00d6sterr.

Due to apparent EU-wide overlaps, the considerable fi-\nnancial implications and the increased demand for the evaluation of oncol-\nogy drugs, a two day \u201eWorkshop on On co-drugs\u201c took place at the LBI-HTA \nat the end of September/beginning of October. 20 people from 12 European HTA Institutes took part, in order to - for the first time - develop options for \nfuture cooperation in the rapid evaluation  of oncology drugs.  This workshop \nwas proposed and hosted by the LBI- HTA, as the lead partner of the \nEUnetHTA Joint Action WP 7B. The joint publication of two Horizon Scan-ing in Oncology Assessments  with partner institut ions (Universit\u00e4tsklini-\nkum Bremen and the Polish  HTA institute AHTAPol ; early January 2011) is \none of the first outcomes of this successful get-together. \nPublications : 14 Decision Support Documents for Horizon Scanning in On-\ncology have been published since autumn 2009, including 9 in 2010: \n\uf062 Gefitinib (Iressa\u00ae) for the first-lin e treatment of non-small cell lung \ncancer.

Nonethelss, due to a lack \nof data, assessments often include modelli ng or simulation techniques in or-\nder to analyse long-term effects. This, in turn requires the increasing coop-\neration of experts from different fields of  science such as HTA, statistics, data \nmanagement, modelling & simulation as well as visualisation. A common understanding on contents, methodolo gy and terminology needs to be devel-\noped. In Austria, such a common underst anding has yet to be developed in a \nsystematic way so far.  \nAims of project:  The main aim of the IFEDH pr oject is to support evidence \nbased decision making in health care using a tool which helps to make the \nmost of the potential of HTA, modelli ng, simulation, statistics and data \nanalysis.Therefore, common standards will be defined in order to facilitate \ncooperation and interdisciplinary work . Three practical examples will be \nused to test the applicability of the tool.  \nLBI-HTA took the leading role in work  package 1 (WP1) as well as the exe-\ncution of WP1.2 and WP2.1. Both WPs will address state of the art standards \nin HTA. WP1.2 focuses on quality standa rds in the discipline in general and \non the evaluation of vaccination prog rammes in particular. The aim is to \npublish an English review. WP2.1 describes the terminology of simulation \nand modelling in the specific context of HTA. The aim is to create a glossary \nin English and German, taking into co nsideration the most relevant interna-\ntional sources. \nResearch objectives WP1.2:  What are general principl es of standardised work \nin HTA? Which standards exist to examine data validity in primary studies? \nWhich standards exist to examine data va lidity in systematic reviews? Which \nstandards exist to examine economic studies? Which standards exist in programme line 5 Annual Report \n2010 \n56 LBI-HTA | 2011 HTA-manuals to examine modelling? Wh ich standards explicitly refer to \nevaluating vaccination programmes? Wh at are the limitations that HTA is \nsubject to, regardless of quality standards? \nResearch objectives  WP2.1 : According to HTA criteria, what are the German \nand English linguistic standards in ma tters of definitions and terminology in \nmodelling and simulation? Methods  WP1.2 & WP2.1:  Hand search based on methodological manuals of \nleading international institutions as well as hand search in other relevant lit-\nerature. WP1.2: Description of sources, list of standards and critical synthe-\nsis of results in English language; WP2. 1: Table of identified terms in the \nform of a glossary. \nEUnetHTA Joint Action 2010-2012 \nProject leader: Claudia Wild \nProject team: Claudia Wild, Gerda Hinte rreiter, Marisa Warmuth, Stefan Mathis, \nAnna Nachtnebel Duration: 2006-2008; 2009; 2010-2012;  \nBackground:  In the course of termination of the EU-project EUnetHTA 2006-\n2008 the partner organisations aimed to develop a strategic concept in order \nto ensure the continuation of EUnetHTA in the interim period of 2009. Overall, a group of 25 partner organisa tions, so-called \u201cfounding partners\u201d, \nfrom 13 EU member states (+ Norway and Switzerland) actively worked on \nthe sustainability of this project. Th e LBI-HTA was a \u201cfounding partner\u201dof \nthe EUnetHTA Collaboration in 2009. Following the interim period, this co-operative scheme has now, thanks to long-term funding from the EU, devel-oped into the \u201eJoint Action 2010-2012\u201c.  \nAims und Methods : In this Joint Action, the LB I-HTA is leading Work pack-\nage 7B, with the aim of reducing overlaps in EU-wide HTA work. In 2010 to \n2012 WP 7/B will develop a webbased data base containing all ongoing and \nplanned assessemnts of the EUnetHTA Jo int Action partner organisations in \norder to avoid overlaps in HTA-work across the EU. A web-based database of \nall Planned and Ongoing Projects (POP da tabase) is to be made available to \nall EUnetHTA partner organisations.   \nResults : Since January 2010 the LBI-HTA has been collecting planned and \nongoing projects every three months. Th ese projects are sorted according to \ntopic and are made available to partne rs. The web-based POP database is cur-\nrently being developed in cooperation with the Belgian HTA Institute KCE. \nIt will be completed in summer 2011 and subsequently made available to all \ncontributing (content providing) EUnetHTA partners.  \nThere has been further cooperation with other EUnetHTA partner organisa-\ntions, such as during the LBI-HTA \u201eHorizon Scanning in Oncology\u201c pro-\nject. Further cooperation, for example in the 2011 MEL assessments, is planned (in progress).   \nPublications : available at EUnetHTA website - http://www.eunethta.eu  programme line 5 Research \nLBI-HTA | 2011 57 2.2 Publications \nAbuzahra, M., Piso, B.

It decided that th e \u201enew\u201c LB Institutes would exist for a \nperiod of 7 years, under the umbrella of its academic  but non-university-\nbased research institution, in order to , within that time period, demonstrate \ntheir benefit to translational rese arch to the society\u2019s partners.  \nNow, the LBG has offered those Institut es which have shown themselves to \nbe successful in their first 4 years the option of a second period, on the fol-\nlowing conditions.  \nCo-financing beyond 2013 requires:  \n1. The handover of the Institute to an  alternative legal representative, \nas well as the withdrawal of LBG funding during the second period  \n2.
