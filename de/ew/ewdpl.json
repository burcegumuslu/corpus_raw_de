As bond yields fell, firms issued bonds to accumulate large amounts of liquid assets that persisted through early 2021. However, these firms generally had access to bank liquidity that they chose not to use: many issuers left their bank credit lines untouched, while others used bond proceeds to repay existing bank loans. Moreover, equity payouts remained high, with over 40% of issuers still repurchasing shares after March 2020. This evidence highlights the value of studying firms' balance sheets, beyond the market rebound, to better understand potential real effects of bond purchases and inform the design of macroeconomic models.\nAdditional information:\n- Speaker: Olivier Darmouni\n- Time: Wednesday, 20.10.2022, 14:45 - 16:00\n- Location: Online via Zoom\n- Further links:\n- Organizer: Finance Group\n- Contact:\n- Almut Lunkenheimer\n- +49 228 73 - 9228\n[ifs@uni-bonn.de](mailto:ifs@uni-bonn.de)", "language": null, "image": "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/ifs/logo.png", "pagetype": "website", "links": ["https://www.uni-bonn.de", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/en/home", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/ifs/en", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/ifs/en", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/ifs/en", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/ifs/@@multilingual-selector/e0eb79778cce44c1a741146f1eedfc7c/en?set_language=en", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/ifs/en/finance", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/ifs/en/statistics", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/ifs/en/people", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/ifs/en/seminars", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/ifs/en/teaching", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/ifs/en/search", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/ifs/en", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/ifs/en/search", null, "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/ifs/en", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/ifs/en/seminars", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/ifs/en/seminars/finance-seminar-ws-2021-22", "https://uni-bonn.zoom.us/j/95735374743?pwd=T3BYbWt1bVZNelkvcDV3SUcxUlkrUT09", "https://sites.google.com/site/olivierdarmouni/", "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3693282", "mailto:ifs@uni-bonn.de", "mailto:ifs@uni-bonn.de", "tel:+49 228 73-9228", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/en/imprint", "https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/en/data-protection-policy"]}
