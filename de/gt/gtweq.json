The prevalence of \ncongenitally missing lateral incisors varies from \n1.5\u201311.5% and is therefore a commonly-presenting \ndentofacial anomaly.1\nPatients with congenitally missing teeth may benefit \ngreatly from orthodontic treatment, in which the \nadjacent teeth are moved in a controlled manner to \nclose the resulting spaces. Although implants, crowns, \nbridges, partial prostheses or fixed prostheses could be \nused to replace the missing teeth, orthodontic space closure and substitution by canines, premolars, or \nthe first, second and third permanent molars is also \na viable option. In many cases, space closure to the \nmesial seems to be a favourable management goal, \nas treatment can be readily completed as soon as the \neruption and development of the dentition is complete. \nThis approach may prove to be a cost-effective option \nas the patient does not require subsequent prosthetic \nrehabilitation with fixed partial dentures or implants. \nCanine substitutions can be accomplished and achieve \ngood aesthetic outcomes by tooth reshaping and \npositioning, bleaching or porcelain veneers.2,3\nOrthodontic space closure should be individually \ntailored and based on the diagnosis and treatment plan. \nThe selection of treatment, involving any technique, \nstage, spring, or appliance design, should be based on Stephan Pies: praxis@kforemscheid.de;  Benedict Wilmes: wilmes@med.uni-duesseldorf.de;  Sivabalan Vasudavan: siva@post.harvard.eduAustralasian Orthodontic Journal Volume 34 No. 1  May 2018104\nPIES, WILMES AND VASUDAVANthe desired tooth movement. Consideration of the \nforce system produced by an orthodontic device aids \nin determining the utility of the device for correcting \na specific problem. Anchorage may be defined as the \namount of movement of the posterior teeth (molars, \npremolars) to close the extraction space in order to \nachieve selected treatment goals. Therefore, the \nanchorage needs of an individual treatment plan could \nvary from absolutely no permitted mesial movement \nof the molars/premolars (or even distal movement \nof the molars required) to complete space closure by \nprotraction of the posterior teeth.\nA complex biomechanical challenge exists in \nclinical scenarios when the successful protraction \nof all premolar and molar teeth is required without \nretraction of the anterior teeth. Loss of anchorage \nis a major orthodontic problem that often leads to \ncompromised treatment results, not only in extraction \ncases, but also in cases requiring molar distalisation or \nprotraction. Therefore predictable anchorage control \nis important in these circumstances because lingual \ntipping of the maxillary and the mandibular incisors \nis best avoided.\nThe use of skeletal anchorage is often indicated \nto assist in achieving the treatment objectives of \nprotracting the maxillary posterior teeth and closing \nthe space resulting from the maxillary lateral incisors \nagenesis. Skeletal anchorage can be derived from \ndental implants (osseointegrated dental analogues), \nsurgical fixation wires, surgically-placed mini-plates \nor \u2018on-plants\u2019. Skeletal anchorage support does not \nrely on patient compliance, permits the incorporation \nof often simple biomechanics, and provides more \npredictable, efficient and effective treatment options.\nThe judicious use of mini-implants has become a \ncommonly-utilised adjunctive orthodontic treatment \noption due to their versatility in integration with \nconcomitant biomechanical initiatives, minimal \ninvasiveness, and relative cost effectiveness. To date, \nthe alveolar process remains the most preferred \ninsertion site,4-8 which can be in the path of moving \nteeth. However, due to varying bone and soft tissue \nconditions, orthodontists are still confronted with an \naverage mini-implant loss rate of 16.1%.9-12\nTo enhance the retention success rate of a mini-\nimplant, five strategies have been developed:\n1.  The selection of the optimum insertion site,\n2.  The avoidance of direct root contact by the mini-\nimplant,3.  The placement of a mini-implant outside of the \nintended path of tooth movement,\n4.  The use of coupled tandem implants to raise \nmini-implant stability, and\n5.  The use of implants with sufficient dimension \nrelated to length and diameter.\nThe successful application of these strategies, and the \nchoice of the anterior palate as a preferred insertion \nsite, has resulted in a profound reduction in the loss of \nmini-implants to a rate of 2.1%.13 Hence, particularly \nin the maxilla, the anterior palatal area is advantageous \nsince all teeth can be moved without interference from \nthe mini-screws.14 Further advantages of the anterior \npalate are good bone quality, a thin attached mucosa, \nminimal risk of tooth injury, and a high associated \nsuccess rate.15,16\nThe opportunity for placement of a mini-implant \nin the region of the anterior palate has rendered \nthe need for placement of the mini-implant within \nthe alveolar ridge almost obsolete. Mini-implants \nhave expanded the envelope of tooth movement \nwidely. Based upon continued experience and the \ndevelopment of clinical acumen, coupled with robust \nscientific evaluation, innovative solutions for a variety \nof treatment objectives such as molar distalisation17,18 \nand mesialisation,19 molar intrusion,20  extrusion of \nimpacted teeth,21 midline correction,22 early Class \nIII treatment23 and anchorage of anterior and lateral \ndental segments24 have been successfully developed.\nThe present case report describes the diagnosis, specific \ntreatment objectives and the orthodontic management \nof an adolescent female patient, who presented at \nage 17 years and one month for the management \nof her malocclusion characterised by the congenital \nabsence of the maxillary lateral incisors, unerupted \nand ectopic premolar teeth, and an anterior deep bite. \nThe treatment objective was to close the residual space \nin the maxillary arch through the protraction of the \nmaxillary canines, first and second premolars, and \nthe first and second molars. The biomechanical plan \nconsisted of utilising direct anchorage with two mini-\nimplants inserted into the anterior hard palate and \nsubsequent detailing of the occlusion with customised \nlingual full fixed orthodontic appliances (WIN, DW \nLingual Systems GmbH, Bad Essen, Germany).\nThe results of the orthodontic treatment, retention \nphase and follow-up care demonstrate that good \naesthetics, functional occlusion and stability were Australasian Orthodontic Journal Volume 34 No. 1  May 2018105\nSPACE MANAGEMENT WITH MESIALSLIDER AND WINachieved. There were no complications associated \nwith the utilisation of the mini-implants.\nDiagnosis and aetiology\nA 17-years-one-month old adolescent female presented \nseeking orthodontic treatment to address her chief \nconcern of congenitally missing upper lateral incisors \nand spacing in the posterior maxillary arch. The patient \nreported a history of previous orthodontic treatment \nin early adolescence, which consisted of mesialisation \nof the maxillary canines and space closure of a central \ndiastema. The patient presented with a balanced facial \nprofile, mildly reduced lower anterior facial height, \nand mild skeletal asymmetry with the chin deviated \nto the right of her mid-sagittal plane. Approximately \n50% of the maxillary incisor crown height was \nvisible on posed smiling, and the smile arc was non-\nconsonant relative to the lower lip. The intraoral dental \nrelationships included an increased anterior deep bite \nof 2.8 mm, a Class II incisor and canine relationship, \nand maxillary arch length excess (spacing) of 5.0 mm \nlocated between the maxillary right and left canines \nand the first premolars. Delayed and ectopic eruption \nof the maxillary left second premolar tooth was noted, \nwith prolonged retention of the maxillary left primary \nsecond molar (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The maxillary \ndental midline was coincident with the facial midline, \nbut the mandibular dental and skeletal midlines were \nboth deviated to the right of the mid-sagittal plane \nby 2.0 mm. The pretreatment photographs and dental \ncasts are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively.\nThe initial panoramic radiograph reveals the \ncongenital absence of the maxillary lateral incisors 12 \nand 22, and the previously protracted canines 13 and \n23. The maxillary third molars were unerupted, and \nappeared to be disto-angularly impacted (Figure 5). \nThe initial cephalometric analysis showed a moderate \nClass III sagittal discrepancy (ANB angle 0.9\u00b0, WITS \n-0.5 mm) with a hypodivergent vertical pattern \n(Figure 6, Table I).\nA functional assessment of the occlusion did not \nshow a discrepancy between centric occlusion and \ncentric relation. There were no signs or symptoms of \ntemporomandibular dysfunction and there were no \nother medical or dental concerns.\nTreatment objectives\nThe clinical criteria for canine substitution of the \ncongenitally absent maxillary lateral incisors include:\nFigure 1.

Additionally, the patient sought correction \nof the midline discrepancy, and an improvement in \nthe animated maxillary incisor tooth display. Second-\nary to the biomechanical complexities associated with \nspace closure and to achieve the sagittal, transverse \nand vertical corrections needed, two mini-implants \nwere inserted in the anterior of the hard palate.\nTreatment alternatives\nAlternative treatment strategies to address the \ncongenital absence of the maxillary lateral incisors \ninclude removable and fixed prosthetic options, \nosseointegrated implants, and autotransplantation \nof the lower second premolar teeth. Whilst these \nprosthetic options may be associated with potentially \nreduced treatment times, each requires surgical \nintervention (dental implants, autotransplantation) \nand potentially significant tooth preparation (fixed \nprosthetics). Variable long-term survival rates and \ncomplications of the alternative prosthetic and \nsurgical options have been reported.25,26 Additionally, \ncoordinated surgical-orthodontic care may also be a \nconsideration, with orthognathic surgery to improve \nfacial vertical proportions and address the chin \nasymmetry.\nTreatment progress\nThe treatment objectives consisted of Type C \nanchorage requirements, in which more than 75% of \nthe residual space needed to be closed by the forward \nmovement of the posterior segments through the \nmesialisation of the maxillary premolars and molars. A Mesialslider (1.1 mm stainless steel wire) connected \nto two median palatal mini-implants (dimensions of \n2 \u00d7 11 mm anterior and 2 \u00d7 9 mm posterior, PSM \nBenefit system), described and reported previously by \nWilmes et al.,19,27-29 was planned for the upper arch as \na source of direct anchorage.\nT reatment commenced with the insertion of the two \npalatal mini-implants, under local anaesthesia, distal to \nthe third palatal rugae. Stainless steel circumferential \nbands were cemented to the maxillary molars.\nSubsequently, a Mesialslider appliance was fitted \n(Figure 7). There were no brackets bonded to the \nmaxillary arch at this time. Custom fabricated \n\u2018Julisprings\u2019 (0.016 \u00d7 0.016 inch, Elgiloy) were \nattached to the maxillary first premolars, and directly \nonto the framework of the Mesialslider. The mesial \ndisplacement force was applied through the bilateral \nuse of Nickel-Titanium open coil springs (240 g) \nsupported by two Guerin locks that were attached to \nthe Mesialslider. Therefore, all distalising forces were \nsupported by the Mesialslider without application \nto the molars. The chosen biomechanical approach \nenabled the line of force action to be applied closer to \nthe centre of resistance of the maxillary first premolars, \nthereby achieving space closure predominantly \nthrough translation, or bodily tooth movement. \nThe maxillary right and left second premolars were \nconnected to the maxillary molars with a sectional \narchwire (0.016 \u00d7 0.022 inch, stainless steel). The \nlocalised space between the maxillary central incisors, \ncanines and first premolars was closed approximately \nsix months into treatment (Figure 8).\nThe newly established position of the maxillary first pre-\nmolars was stabilised by the placement of the Guerin \nlocking mechanisms directly distal to the \u2018Julisprings\u2019. \nThe protraction of the connected upper second \nFigure 7.

The Nickel-Titanium \nopen coil springs were removed. The mesialisation of \nthe combined second premolars and first molars was \nfurther assisted through the application of elastomeric \npowerchains attached to the \u2018Julisprings\u2019 (Figure 8). \nAfter 17 months of treatment, the mesialisation of the \nmaxillary second premolars and the maxillary first and \nsecond molars was completed, and the Mesialslider \nwas removed (Figure 9). During this time both upper \nfirst molars were mesialised 5.0 mm.\nPolyvinyl siloxane impressions of the maxillary and \nmandibular arches were obtained for the fabrication \nof customised lingual full fixed orthodontic appliances \n(WIN, DW Lingual Systems, GmbH, Bad Essen, \nGermany). An interim Essix\u00a9 clear removable retainer \nwas provided to the patient to maintain space closure \nprior to the fitting of the lingual appliances.\nThe comprehensive phase of treatment included the \nunderlying objectives of levelling and alignment of the maxillary dental arches, along with the completion of \nspace closure in the mandibular arch. The midlines \nstill required correction and the maxillary anterior \nteeth were to be positioned for prosthetic recontouring \n(Figure 10 and Figure 11).\nTo facilitate prosthetic enhancement of the clinical \ncrown height of the maxillary first premolars and \nbetter simulate the natural appearance of a maxillary \ncanine, the maxillary first premolars were intruded \nthrough a series of 0.0175 \u00d7 0.0175 inch TMA \ncustomised archwires. The first finishing archwire was \nprogrammed to deliver an intrusive displacement of \n1.0 mm, and the second archwire, a total intrusive \ndisplacement of 1.5 mm to the maxillary first \npremolars (Figure 12).\nThe comprehensive phase of treatment using the \ncustomised lingual appliances was completed over a \nperiod of 24 months.

Intraoral photographs after two years of retention.\nDiscussion\nThere has been a recent proliferation of published \ncases and clinical studies illustrating the mesialisation \nof second and third molars into the space of missing \nfirst molars.19,30-35 However, it is believed that the \northodontic treatment performed for the present \npatient was unique amongst previously reported \ncases for several reasons. To ensure that no retraction \nof the maxillary anterior segment occurred during \ntreatment, the requirement to reinforce anterior and \nvertical anchorage was imperative. Furthermore, \nthe congenital absence of the maxillary lateral \nincisors created a scenario in which space closure \nin the maxillary arch had to be performed entirely \nthrough protraction of the maxillary posterior dental \nsegment. Specifically, the first and second premolars \nand molars had to be advanced, requiring anchorage \nreinforcement. Finally, the maxillary and mandibular \nfull fixed appliances were not attached during the first \n17 months of active space closure in the maxillary arch. Although the total treatment time was 41 \nmonths, the proportion of time spent in full fixed \nappliances was only 24 months. The extended period \nof full fixed appliance wear was due to the patient \nresiding in Spain, and travelling to Germany on an \nintermittent basis for care. The comprehensive phase \nof treatment of the malocclusion involved customised \nlingual orthodontic appliances, and essentially was \nnot readily discernible.\nAccording to research conducted by Roberts et al.,36 \nthe rate of molar traction can be as low as 0.2 mm \nper month. From a clinical perspective, the maxilla is \nmore responsive to orthodontic treatment because it \nis primarily composed of trabecular bone. While the \nrate of tooth movement is the inverse of anchorage \npotential, the same physiologic principles apply.\nClinical studies using endosseous implants for \nanchorage have provided excellent opportunities to \nassess the rate of tooth movement through the dense \ncortical bone in the posterior mandible compared Australasian Orthodontic Journal Volume 34 No. 1  May 2018114\nPIES, WILMES AND VASUDAVANwith the less dense trabecular bone of the posterior \nmaxilla. The enhanced anchorage value of mandibular \nmolars is related to the high density of bone formed \nas the leading roots are moved mesially. After a few \nmonths of mesial translation, the trailing roots engage \nthe high-density bone formed by the leading root \nand the rate of tooth movement declines. Overall, \nthe maximal rate of translation of the mid-root area \nthrough dense cortical bone is about 0.5 mm per \nmonth for the first few months, and subsequently the \nrate declines to less than 0.3 mm per month.\nMultiple published case reports state that molar \nprotraction to close the space of a congenitally absent \nsecond premolar is a challenging treatment procedure, \nwith treatment durations of 40+ months (Goellner37). \nThe total treatment time for the present patient was \n41 months (three years and five months), which is \nwell within the reported average of two to four years \nfor cases requiring molar mesialisation.38\nThe treatment changes measured on the lateral \ncephalograms demonstrate that there were minimal \nchanges in the maxillary and mandibular incisor \nangulations, suggesting preservation of anterior \nanchorage during the molar mesialisation process. \nOne of the treatment objectives was to produce bodily \nmovement or translation of the maxillary premolars \nand molars, rather than tipping of the crowns, to \navoid potential future periodontal complications. To \nthis end, the protractive forces were applied parallel \nto the centre of the resistance of the posterior dental segment. The post-treatment panoramic radiograph \ndemonstrates that the bodily movement of the \nposterior dental segment was achieved. A study using \na finite element analysis has shown that directly \napplied force from a mini-screw to a posterior molar \nrequiring mesialisation (direct anchorage) exerted \nlower strains on anchor teeth in comparison with \nindirect anchorage, particularly in the mandibular \narch.30\nIt was elected to provide the patient with an additional \nremovable Essix\u00a9 clear removable retainer, which \nwould be worn up to the time of reshaping of her \nupper incisors, canines, and first premolars.\nThe salient and challenging characteristics of the \npresent case included the significant amount of \ntranslatory tooth movement directed toward the \nanterior segment of the arch.39 If the mesial movement \nof the molar crown is indicated during space closure, \nthis can be achieved either by means of a space closing \nloop, a super elastic coilspring or a lingual arch. The \nproblems related to the mesial movement of the roots \nare the same regardless of the appliance used. The line \nof action has to pass apical to the centre of resistance \nof the dental segment, and will always result in a \ncombined uprighting mesial movement and extrusion.\nIn order to perform the uprighting combined with \nmesial movement, the vertical forces should be \nmanaged. Furthermore, the clinician must reinforce \nanchorage and neutralise undesirable vertical forces. \nIn general, it is extremely difficult to displace a tooth \nFigure 20.

When \nmolars are advanced in such cases with skeletal \nanchorage systems, a tendency for extrusion and a \nreduction of the vertical overbite has been reported.\nA combined molar uprighting and mesial movement \nis possible only if the line of force action is below the \ncentre of resistance of the molar. This can be obtained \nby the use of power arms displacing the point of \napplication and traction springs placed both labially \nand lingually. However, the problems with this \nappliance are that (1) it delivers extrusive forces to the \nmolar, (2) the localisation of the line of action, with \nrespect to the anterior unit, is such that anchorage loss \nmay occur and, finally, (3) the moment, acting on the \nmolar, is not very large. As a consequence, this system \ncannot be readily applied. In particular, in cases in \nwhich bilateral uprighting and mesial movements are \ndesirable, anchorage loss is not permissible. To mitigate \nagainst this difficulty, the Mesialslider arms were \nadjusted in an apical direction prior to its insertion \nand engagement into the maxillary first molar bands. \nBy so doing, a desired intrusive displacement of the \nmaxillary molar teeth was achieved.\nWilmes et al.19,27 have suggested for convenience in \nroutine practice that the arms of the Mesialslider \nmay be adjusted chair-side. This negates the need \nfor a dental laboratory and potentially saves the \northodontist in time and costs. As an alternative, an \nimpression may be taken placing impression caps \nand laboratory analogues for manufacture of the \nMesialslider on a plaster model. The Mesialslider \nhas also been proposed for mesialising in cases with \nmissing anterior teeth in addition to missing posterior \nteeth. Hence, the appliance has a wide variety of \napplications for dentoalveolar sagittal movements. \nFigure 21 illustrates images of the Benefit system and \nits constituent parts for individualisation in differing \nanchorage requirements. Although the present case \nused part L, which fits easily into the palatal tubes of \nthe maxillary first molar bands without a laboratory \nsoldering procedure, part K could have been used as \nwell and soldered to the maxillary first molar bands.\nSoldering part K to the maxillary first molar bands \ncould provide a stiffer connection and, as a result, \nbetter bodily mesialisation of the molars.\nNevertheless, good bodily advancement of all \nmaxillary premolars and molars was achieved in the \npresent case.\nAll maxillary first premolars were mesialised into alveolar areas associated with previous periodontal \nbone loss. Animal40 and human experiments41 have \nshown that when a tooth is moved into a region of \nreduced alveolar volume, the periodontal apparatus \nof the moved tooth shows minimal periodontal \nalterations. Additionally, there can be a positive \nchange in the width of the alveolar ridge.41 This was \nclearly seen in the presented case and ascribed to \nthe excellent oral hygiene maintained by the patient \nthroughout treatment.\nThe intrusion of molars using mini-implant supported \nbiomechanics and associated root resorption has been \ninvestigated previously by volumetric computed \ntomography techniques.40 The results suggest that \nthere is an increased risk of mild to moderate root \nresorption caused by the intrusion particularly of the \nmesio-buccal root of the molars. Interestingly, no \nsignificant root resorption was seen affecting any teeth \nin the presented case when assessed on the panoramic \nradiograph. This may have been due to the reduced \ntime in fixed appliances and/or differing amounts of \nintrusion when compared with other studies.\nThere were no complications seen or reported during \nand following orthodontic treatment. The patient \nwas highly motivated throughout, and maintained \ngood oral hygiene. At completion, sound occlusal \ninterdigitation and intercuspation were established.\nConclusion\nThe successful orthodontic management and resolu-\ntion of residual maxillary arch spacing in a patient pre-\nsenting with congenitally absent lateral incisors is pre-\nsented. The biomechanical plan consisted of the use \nof two maxillary mini-implants to maintain the strin-\ngent anchorage requirements during space closure, \nand the subsequent final detailing of the occlusion was \nperformed with a fully customised lingual appliance \n(WIN). The total treatment duration of 41 months \nwas well within reported averages for cases involving \nmolar advancement. The desired objectives of a pleas-\ning smile and facial aesthetics, functional occlusion \nand stability were achieved without complications.\nReferences\n1.  Robertsson S, Mohlin B.
