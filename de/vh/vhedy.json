As yet there was no such thing as \u201cmai nstream\u201d medicine or \u2013 as we read in the \nGerman Social Security Code today (Section 2 paragraph 1) \u2013 a \u201cgenerally acknowledged \nstate of medical knowledge\u201d. On the contrary : the academic physicians were hopelessly \ndivided. Up until 1850, for instan ce, nosological considerations largely followed the doctrine \nof the four body humours that had prevailed si nce antiquity. Phenomena observed in healthy \nor sick subjects were shoehorned into vari ous systems that popped up like fashions and \nvanished again. The range of therapies on offer from academic physicians was \ncorrespondingly diverse.  \nAs early as the first half of the nineteenth century a process started in the industrializing \nnations that medical historians re fer to as \u2018professionalization\u2019.1 An essential characteristic of \nthis process is the monopolization of the medical  market, made possible by the large-scale and \neffective representation of professional intere sts through the physicians\u2019 association and other \nmedical organizations. It was not only afte r 1850, with the breakth rough of scientific \nmedicine, that the university-t rained physicians claimed a m onopoly or, in other words, the \n\u201cmedical power of interpretation\u201d.2 They insisted that they alone were able to understand \nillness and initiate successful therapies. Ofte n, though, this was no more than a claim. Right \nup into the twentieth century, the majority of  the population thought differently. Patients were \nnot as impressed with the academ ic titles of their chosen h ealers as with their practical \nexperience.3 In 1931, the German association for peopl e\u2019s health and freedom of medicine \n(Zentralverband f\u00fcr Volksgesundhe it und Freiheit des Heilwesens ) addressed an open letter to \nall members of the Reichstag , demanding among other things that  \u201cthe entire medical system \n[be] freed from the existing obstacles and monopolies.\u201d In particular, they asked for \n\u201ccomplete parity of the two prevailing medical orientations  [mainstream and \u2018independent\u2019 \nmedicine\u2019 R. J.]4\u201d The 1939 Non-Medical Practitioner Act [ Heilpraktikergesetz ) needs to be \nseen in this light. Critics \u2013 not all of them phys icians \u2013 declared again recently that this Act \nwas a separate and erroneous step in German healthcare.5 \nLet\u2019s return to the nineteenth century. While  the academically trained physicians had long \naspired to a monopolization of the medical market, their en deavours were not crowned by \nlasting success up until th e second half of the nineteenth century.6 The British Medical Act of \n1858, for instance, which demanded the establishmen t of a Medical Register and has therefore  2often been seen as a milestone in the history of medical professionali zation in Great Britain, \ndid by no means achieve the desired monopoly in therapies. On the contrary. A movement \nemerged in Britain which secured the support of diverse groups and opposed any kind of \nmonopolization in healthcare. This liberal att itude is still noticeable today in the British \nNational Health System, even though homeopathy is now indeed struggling to hold on to its \nestablished status there.7 \nUS physicians never achieved even such m odest government support in their struggle for \nmonopoly. In the 1830s and 1840s they even lost the privileges that had previously been \ngranted to them in some st ates. The American Medical A ssociation, f ounded in 1847 in \nresponse to the liberalization and the pressure fr om competitors in the health market, received \nno support whatsoever from the State for its aspi rations to license physi cians. In the second \nhalf of the nineteenth century an increasing number of US states  left the medical licensing to \noften mixed bodies, with the result that homeopath s and \u201ceclectics\u201d were also able to acquire \nofficial licences.8 This only changed with the public ation of the Flexner Report in 1910. \nHowever, this report was aimed at the medical schools rather than the medical provision in \nthe American health market, as  is apparent from the successf ul development of chiropractic \nand osteopathy as well as from the fact that homeopathic practices continued to exist.9 \nWe also observe the opposite of  monopolization in the German Re ich in the last third of the \nnineteenth century. There, the physicians felt so superior to other healer s that they initially \nagreed to the full liberalization of the medical market as part of the Trade Regulation Acts \n[Gewerbeordnungen ] of 1869 or 1871. But it was not long before they complained that the \nexistence of competition did not seem to act in their favour.10 More and more physicians in \nGermany became annoyed with the flourishing mark et in arcane remedies so that, from the \n1880s onwards, the German Medical Associatio n demanded a ban on any kind of quackery. \nTheir complaint remained unheeded by the lawmakers, however.11 The Non-Medical \nPractitioners\u2019 Act, passed by the Nazis in 1939, c ontinues to be valid to this day with only \nslight amendments, a fact that is a thorn in the flesh of many a representive of the medical \nbrotherhood.  \nOnly in the very sparsely populated Scandinavi an countries did the p hysicians manage to \nsteadily expand their share of nineteenth century  healthcare provision and protect themselves \nagainst the unwelcome competition from other healers. There, the medical organizations \nsucceeded, without much commotion or conflict , in transforming the professional privileges \ninto a well-functioning form of state-supporte d professional control. Representatives of  3complementary medicine struggle to surv ive in those countries to this day.12 But even there, \nthe first signs of a budding me dical pluralism are emerging. \nWe can therefore say that there is not only a clear delimitation between professional and other \nhealers in almost all countries today, but the obs ervation of this demarca tion is also strictly \nmonitored by the legislators - \u201cin the interest of  the patient.\u201d Nonetheles s: this does not seem \nto stop patients from seeking help in the ni ches of the unregulated health market.  \nThe professionalization mentioned earlier has further effects on the healthcare provision \navailable. This brings us to another importa nt observation. With the exception of the nursing \nand care duties, the lay system is no longer permitt ed to provide any kind  of medical services. \nAs early as the end of the eighteenth century, the health information sources admonished the \nsubjects not to undertake any steps in case of  illness without consulting a licensed healer \n(best, of course, a physician).13 Many people conformed to this advice and consulted medical \nexperts when they were ill, albeit not n ecessarily trained physicians but often semi-\nprofessional healers. The reasons for their be haviour are obvious: they  were socially and \nspatially close to this group of healers and shared cultural commonalities with them. The degree of medicalization or, to be more precise, the density of physicians, also played an \nimportant part\n14, a circumstance we still observe today in  some countries, not only in Africa \nbut also in India. \nHow is the situation today with regard to pluralism in official healthcare?15 India has had \nmedical pluralism for many decades and this is also reflected in its official healthcare structures.\n16 In Germany the \u201cDialog Forum for Pl uralism in Medicine\u201d, co-founded by the \nformer president of the German Medical Associa tion, has made every effort in the last fifteen \nyears to contribute to a constr uctive discourse between the repr esentatives of mainstream and \ncomplementary medicine, through an open dialogue among physicians, in order to achieve the best possible patient care.\n17 But not much has changed so fa r. Hardly a month goes by without \nindividual CAM therapies, homeopathy in part icular, being ostracised or frowned upon on the \npretext that medicine had to be \u201cevidence-base d\u201d. And yet, surveys have revealed that CAM \ntherapies are ever more popular among patients18, a fact that explains the vehemence of the \nattacks \u2013 above all on homeopathy. The relati onship between \u201cmainstream\u201d medicine and \ncomplementary medicine in Germany continues to be informed by mutual distrust and a \ntendency to demarcation. There is, at present,  no sign of any system atic cooperation between \nbiomedicine and any of the other, very di verse, medical systems (TCM, Anthroposophic \nMedicine, homeopathy) for the benefit of the patient. If anything, we see an \u201casymmetric  4coexistence\u201d with medical sc hools almost exclusively teach ing and applying conventional \nmedicine and complementary medicine being widely used additionally in many areas of out-\npatient care.  \nWhat is urgently needed is internal clarif ication of the relations hip between the diverse \nmedical approaches that respects the model of medical pluralism and uses it as the starting \npoint for a discussion on coopera tion and coexistence. For this it is necessary to openly \ndiscuss the possibilities and limitations of each medical approach and conception. The \npotential of these approaches to mutually comple ment each other also needs to be scrutinized, \nwith a view to promoting, in the interest of be st-possible and effective patient care, the further \ndevelopment of a pluralism that at present seem s non-transparent, with the aim of attaining a \nsustainable plurality, where dive rse ways of thinking and dive rse practical approaches in \nmedicine form a meaningful whole. This will probably need a political impulse, as we can see \nfrom the example of India.19  \nAn administrative approach tested during Worl d War II in Calcutta and other Bengali places, \nbecame something like a model for the entire Dominion of India once India had attained \nindependence. The Homeopathic Enquiry Co mmittee, set up in September 1948 through a \nresolution passed by the Indian Pa rliament, was given the task of  evaluating the situation and \nsubmitting recommendations and proposals for the integration of homeopathy into the \nnational health system. It was not until 1973, howe ver, that the former outsider medicine was \nofficially granted parity with other medical systems. Since th en it has had unlimited state \nsupport. A system has been implemented in Indi a that one high  ranking representative of \nIndian homeopathy has termed the \u201ccaf eteria approach\u201d in healthcare:20 patients choose the \nmenu that suits them, and all the State does is make sure that the individual meals on offer \nconform to the usual quality standards and th at no health risks are being overlooked. \nEurope is still a far cry from this kind of me dical pluralism. In Ge rmany only a very few \nhealing approaches have, controversially, been granted the status of \u201cspecial therapies\u201d, \nprimarily in the context of pharmaceutical legislation.21 Based on a scientific pluralism in \ndrug therapy that is emphasized again and ag ain by the judiciary, th e German Medicinal \nProducts Act explicitly demands that specific asp ects of the \u201cspecial ther apies\u201d be taken into \nconsideration. The legislators have set up sp ecial commissions for this purpose, which \nintroduce the necessary medical expertise into  the work of the responsible authority.  \nIn Switzerland, medical pluralism has arrived by a different route.22 There, a referendum \nmade sure that alternative medical approaches  were included into the list of healthcare  5provisions covered by the statutory health insurance. The popular initiative \u201cYes to \nComplementary Medicine\u201d, which was founded in 2005, collected close to 139,000 signatures \nin a very short time. In the same year, h ealth minister Pascal  Couchepin had five \ncomplementary medical systems struck off the list  of treatments included in basic healthcare \nprovision \u2013 homeopathy, neural therapy, phytot herapy, TCM and Anthroposophic Medicine \u2013 \nprovoking open opposition from alternative therapis ts practising in Switzerland as well as \nfrom patients. In surveys it was ascertained  that the majority of the population wanted \ncomplementary medicine. The result of the referendum on 17 May 2009 was unambiguous. \nMore than two thirds of the votes (67 per ce nt) were in favour of the proposal submitted by \nthe popular initiative \u201cYes to  Complementary Medicine\u201d. The new constitutional ruling, \nwhich had majority support, states that \u201cBoth th e State and the Cantons will ensure within the \nambit of their responsib ilities that complementary medicine  is taken into consideration.\u201d \nPutting this ruling into practice has been difficu lt so far, because it is  not clearly apparent \nfrom the amendment achieved through the will of the people that certain methods of \ncomplementary medicine have to be included in the statutory health insurance. It is \nnevertheless a fact that Switzerland is so far the only country in Europe where pluralism in \nmedicine is required by the constitution. \nBut what Medical Pluralism are we talking a bout? Are there new forms of Medical Pluralism \nnow, \u201cIntegrative Medicine\u201d for instance?23 The \u201cresurfacing\u201d and increasing legitimization \nof CAM that we have seen in the United States and Western Europe since the 1980s24 has \ninspired two British researchers, Sarah Cant and Ursula Sharma, to pronounce a \u201cnew medical \npluralism\u201d. The two scientists claim that various factors, including health-economic \nconsiderations, have induced governments to take a more pos itive view of Alternative \nMedicine. At the same time, they say, there has been a \u201crefiguring of expertise\u201d, because the \nmodern state depended on the expert knowledge of the various professions. The users of \nalternative therapies had benefited above all fr om shifts in the soci al relations between \nbiomedicine, government and consumers.25 Since this form of pluralism, which emerged in \nthe late twentieth century, allegedly differs considerably from that of \u201cpremodern\u201d times, Cant and Sharma have termed it a \u201cnew\u201d medical pluralism.\n26 Proponents of this concept27 \nhave pointed out that in this kind of plural ism biomedicine continues to occupy a dominant \nposition and to assign to the various therapies differing degrees of legitimacy and prestige by demanding evidence based on natural-scientific premises. It is also true that the alternative medical systems often compete or fight with each other for their place in a health market that \nis increasingly determined by consumers rather than patients in the original sense of the word.  6But even if this form of medical pluralism wa s entirely new \u2013 a claim that historians are \nentirely justified in questioning \u2013 there is one constant shared by the new and the old medical \npluralism, and that is homeopathy. \nAs a history spanning more than two hundred ye ars illustrates, homeopathy constitutes, as no \nother CAM approach, the Litmus test for medi cal pluralism. The attacks on non-established \nmedical systems are almost always directed at homeopathy, even though other methods of \ncomplementary medicine provide similar targets for critics.28 A survey conducted in 2006 \namong German physicians of various disciplines, asking about their view  of CAM therapies, \nhas revealed that only a third of  them consider Anthropological Medicine to be scientifically \nfounded, while more than fifty per cent think the same of homeopathy.29 Nevertheless, the \ncriticism of the \u201csceptics\u201d who denounce what they  see as paramedicine is primarily directed \nat homeopathy. According to one critic homeopa thy is so unscientific that it should be \nprevented from conducting research!  \nMany homeopaths therefore hope that Integr ative Medicine \u2013 which was, by the way, \npromoted  in Germany under a different  name as early as the 1920s and 1930s30 \u2013 will help \nthem find access to the medical establishment. Wh ile they are not the only ones, they are the \nones that will be longest kept out of this \u201cclub\u201d, as is apparent in Germany from the \ndifficulties experienced by CAM associations s eeking admission to the German Association \nof Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF).31 \nBut before the hopes for the longed-for recognition rise too high, may the historian be \npermitted to point out that full integration, as past  experience shows, will  lead to a standstill. \nThis happens whenever the philosophy behind th e alternative therapies subsumed under this \ngeneric name loses importance and only their sp ecific applications (drugs, potentization, \nneedles in acupuncture, or particular techniques in manual medicine) are used, mostly because \nthey can provide the evidence prescribed by biomed icine. One example from history is that of \n\u201cEclectic Medicine\u201d which was in  vogue in the United States in the late nineteenth century \nbut later disappeared from the medical market without a trace.32  \nShould a new medical pluralism i ndeed become the model of the future, the decision will lie \nwith the lawmakers who, in turn, will be guid ed by the will of the voters. The view the state \ntakes when it comes to traditional medical therapies will depend more than ever on questions of economy because society is ageing and chroni c disease on the rise. This could indeed be a \nchance for homeopathy, but only if public interest  is directed away from the question of \nevidence to the kind of efficacy shown in outcome  studies. This, in turn, needs more research  7\u2013 but not basic research, because basic re search can hardly hope for funding from the \npharmaceutical industry. The success story of the National Center for Complementary and \nIntegrative Health  (NCCIH) in the United States proves th at such research is possible when \nthe state provides sufficient funds to test the effectiveness of medical systems in healthcare \nprovision \u2013 without prejudice and independently of i ndustrial interests. In 2015, the NCCIH \nhad a research budget of 124.1 million US Dollars.33 It needs to be mentioned, however, that \nthe research projects that have so far benefited from this funding were not related to \nhomeopathy in particular. Other therapies with similarly long-st anding traditions, such as \nosteopathy, have been at the cen tre of the NCCIH\u2019s interest.34 \nMy initial question has not been answered ye t: what can history teach us about medical \npluralism? The history of medicine can illu strate how the present healthcare system has \nevolved and that it can change in principl e. Knowledge of prem odern phenomena can \nconfirm, or put into perspectiv e, what seems modern to us. Especially when it comes to \nhomeopathy as the litmus test for medical plural ism, the following verdict of a history teacher \napplies, \u201cWherever historical arguments, myths, semi-consci ous and uninformed memories \nand memory fragments are still consulted in orde r to justify and legitimize existing conditions \n[\u2026] the rational and critical study of history is indispensable.\u201d35 The professional \nhistoriography of homeopathy is equally indispensable, as is apparent from its uncovering of \nthe historical myths used as arguments in health politics.  It also includes a factual, methodical \nand accurate investigation of the role homeopathy played in Germany during the Third Reich.\n36 And it unfortunately also includes the clarif ication required again and again, that the \noriginator of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann, for whom a memorial was soon erected in \nLeipzig, was neither a Jew nor a Muslim, but a baptized protestant a nd freethinker.  Speaking \nof memorials: when the stat ue of Hahnemann was unveiled in  Leipzig in 1851, one speaker \nreminded his listeners that there was something more important than devoting a memorial to \nthe founder of homeopathy \u2013 however much Hahnema nn deserved this \u2013 and that was to think \nof the future. The means he listed for achie ving this goal were \u201cWritings, the proving of \ndrugs, hospitals, university chairs, pharmacies, a ssociations for the promotion of homeopathy, \ntravel etc.\u201d37 A list worth remembering. \n   8*English translation of the inaugural lecture at the Homeopathic World Congress, Leipzig, \n14th June 2017  \nReferences \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1 Robert J\u00fctte: Professionalisierung der \u00c4rzt eschaft.
