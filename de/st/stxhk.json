Vestibular function was assessed by calorics(low-frequency response of the lateral semicircular canal), vestibulo-ocular re \ufb02ex by video\nhead impulse test (vHIT) of the three semicircular canals, cervical and ocular vestibularevoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP, saccule and oVEMP, utricle).

Surgical damage toeither system was widely believed to\ncause loss of function in the other.\nHere, we investigated the function ofthe balance receptors before andafter severe damage to the part of theinner ear which is responsible forhearing (the cochlea) due to surgicalremoval of tumurs. We show thatdespite the close proximity of both\ntypes of receptors and the severe\ntrauma to the cochlea, in mostpatients the balance system can stillfunction normally. This observationmay have important implications forhow we treat patients with inner earsurgery and for the techniques weuse to treat hearing and balance\ndisorders.\nCOMMUNICATIONS MEDICINE |            (2021) 1:37 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-021-00036-w | www.nature.com/commsmed 11234567890():,;The perception of balance and spatial orientation is achieved\nand maintained by a complex set of sensorimotor control\nsystems including input from the vestibular receptors in\nthe inner ear. Diseases or trauma with disturbances of vestibularfunction result in dizziness and vertigo and exhibit a substantial\nimpact on daily life in humans, especially for bilateral vestibular\nhypofunction\n1. The receptors for both the sense of hearing and\nbalance \u2014the cochlear and vestibular sensory systems \u2014are\nhoused together in the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear\nand share the same \ufb02uids with a tightly regulated homeostasis.\nThe\ufb02uid bathing the receptors of both systems, endolymph, is\ncrucial for normal receptor function and the major generation of\nthis\ufb02uid takes place in the stria vascularis of the cochlea.\nSurgical approaches to each of these systems have adhered to a\nprinciple, that damage to the membranous labyrinth of either\nsystem will cause almost certain permanent loss of the receptor\nfunction of both systems. Although the overall clinical effect of\nminimally invasive surgical approaches to the cochlea (like a\ncochleostomy during cochlear implantation, CI) on the vestibular\nfunction is considered to be non-signi \ufb01cant2, CI may lead to\nvestibular dysfunction and dizziness in some patients2\u20135. There-\nfore, any inner ear surgery generally aims on \u2018atraumatic \u2019surgical\ntechniques. That principle, however, has been called into question\nbecause there have been anecdotal reports in individual patients\nof at least partial preservation of cochlear function after major\nsurgical damage to the vestibular division and vice versa6\u201313.\nHere we report for the \ufb01rst time (to the best of our knowledge)\nin a large case series, that after major trauma to the cochlea \u2014\ncochlear removal to treat intracochlear schwannoma, removing\nthe membranous labyrinth of the cochlea \u2014the vestibular recep-\ntors continue to function normally, as shown by speci \ufb01c, objective\ntests of peripheral vestibular function before and after surgery.\nThese results demonstrate that under particular conditions, the\ncochlear and vestibular sensory systems can function indepen-\ndently, which has important implications for inner ear surgical\nprocedures, and the development of neural interfaces of sensory\nprostheses for the auditory system and gene and cell-based innerear therapies.\nMethods\nStudy design, setting, and participants . The study comprises a\nlarge retrospective and prospective monocentric case series ana-\nlyzing results from a tertiary (university) referral center. Patients\nincluded all consecutive patients with surgical resection of\nintracochlear schwannomas, most of them with hearing rehabi-\nlitation with a cochlear implant (CI).\nSurgery . Surgical tumor removal was achieved through partial or\nsubtotal cochleoectomy as described in detail elsewhere\n14.I n\nshort: The tumor was removed through a retroauricular-trans-\nmeatal, microscopic surgical approach. The cochlear capsule was\nopened exposing the tumor anterior to the RW, followed by\ndrilling along the basal turn. A bony arch was left at the round\nwindow to later secure the electrode carrier (Fig. 1). The second\nturn was opened anterior to the oval window. In order to gain\naccess to tumor parts located medially to the modiolus, the apical\nparts of the modiolus were removed preserving as much as\npossible of the modiolus, which contains the spiral ganglion cells\nin Rosenthal \u2019s canal. During surgery, the base of scala tympani\nwas blocked towards the hook region and the base of scala ves-\ntibuli and scala media with soft tissue. If patients received a CI, a\ndevice with a precurved, perimodiolar electrode carrier (CI512 or\nCI612; Nucleus CI, Cochlear, Sydney, Australia) was used. The\ncochlear defect was closed with an autologous cartilage/peri-\nchondrium compound transplant and bone p\u00e2t\u00e9.Measurements of peripheral vestibular and auditory function .\nPrior to the surgery (<6 months) and during 12 months after\nsurgery, the function of each vestibular sensory region was\nobjectively assessed by speci \ufb01c, objective peripheral vestibular\ntests: Calorics (low-frequency response of the lateral semicircular\ncanal), vestibulo-ocular re \ufb02ex (VOR) by video head impulse test\n(vHIT) (manually induced head impulse response of lateral,\nanterior and posterior semicircular canals), cervical vestibular-\nevoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP, saccule), and ocular\nvestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMP, utricle). The\nfunction of the auditory system was assessed as speech recogni-\ntion with the CI, if applicable.\nSpontaneous nystagmus and calorics .V i d e o n y s t a g m o g r a p h yw a s\nperformed using a Hortmann Vestlab videonystagmography system\nand the Vestlab OS software (GN Otometrics, Taastrup, Denmark).\nOver a recording period of 30 s, eye movements larger than 0.3\u00b0/s\nwere identi \ufb01ed and considered as spontaneous nystagmus (SPN) and\ncounted. Caloric stimulation of both external ear canals was main-\ntained by cold (30 \u00b0C) and warm (44 \u00b0C) water volumes of 75 ml\nwithin time periods of 30 s. Low-frequency responses of the lateral\nsemicircular canal (SCC) with horizontal and vertical eye move-\nments were recorded for 60 s. Eye movements larger than 0.75\u00b0/s\nwere identi \ufb01ed and considered as nystagmus. Slow-phase velocity\n(SPV) of all eye movements after ipsilateral and contralateral caloric\nirrigation was automatically ca lculated. Maximum absolute SPV\nvalues of the ipsilateral (SPV ipsi) and contralateral (SPV contra)s i d e s\nwere used to calculate the vestibular response relative to the side\naffected by the tumor with the formula: (SPV ipsi,cold+SPV ipsi,warm \u2013\nSPV contra,cold \u2013SPV contra,warm )/(SPV ipsi,cold+SPV ipsi,warm +SPV contra,\ncold+SPV contra,warm ). Negative values indicated a reduced response\non the ipsilateral side, and positive values indicated a reduced\nresponse on the contralateral side. Results below \u201325% and above\n25% were considered abnormal.\nVestibulo-ocular re \ufb02ex. VOR recordings were performed to assess\nimpulse responses of all SCCs using a video head-impulse test(vHIT) system (GN Otometrics, Taastrup, Denmark). After\nsmall (10 \u201320\u00b0) and fast unpredictable passive head turns aligned\nto the SCC orientations (lateral, left anterior-right posterior\n(LARP), and right anterior-left posterior (RALP) planes), the\nvestibulo-ocular response (VOR gain) was measured together\nwith overt and covert saccades which were identi \ufb01ed after\nrecording by a 250-Hz high-speed eye camera that also measured\nhead movements. Absolute mean VOR gain between eye and\nhead movement of the affected and non-affected sides was\nmeasured.\nVestibular-evoked myogenic potentials . Otolith function was\nassessed by measuring cervical (cVEMP) and ocular (oVEMP)\nvestibular-evoked myogenic potentials using the Eclipse Platform\n(Interacoustics, Copenhagen, Denmark) that stimulated mon-\naurally with tone bursts (1 or 2 cycles plateau; no rise/fall; 8 Hz\nstimulus repetition rate). For air-conducted VEMPs, insert ear-\nphones were used with tone bursts of 500 Hz at a stimulation level\nof 100 dB nHL. For bone-conducted VEMPs either a B81 trans-\nducer (Radioear, New Eagle, USA) stimulating with 500 Hz at\n70 dB nHL or the recently developed B250 transducer (Chalmers,\nGothenburg, Sweden) stimulating with 250 Hz at 80 dB nHL were\nused\n15,16. Preoperatively, only air-conducted cVEMPs and\noVEMPs were measured because bone conduction was not\navailable in most cases. Postoperative cVEMPs and oVEMPs were\nalways measured to bone-conducted stimulation, because the\nincus was removed during surgical tumor removal (Fig. 1b),\nresulting in loss of air conduction. In addition, air-conducted\nVEMP testing in CI patients bears the risk of false-negative resultsARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS MEDICINE | https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-021-00036-w\n2 COMMUNICATIONS MEDICINE |            (2021) 1:37 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-021-00036-w | www.nature.com/commsmeddue to (inner ear) conductive loss, and response rates to bone-\nconducted stimulation have been reported to be higher compared\nto air-conducted stimulation17. Due to these methodological\ndifferences, only the postoperative VEMPs were analyzed, and\namplitudes and latencies of the affected ipsilateral side were\ncompared to the contralateral side as a reference.\ncVEMPs were measured using self-adhesive Neuroline 720 sur-\nface electrodes (Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark) placed on the\nupper half of the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscles, a\nreference electrode on the sternum, and the ground electrode on\nthe forehead. In an upright sitting position, patients were\ninstructed to rotate their heads toward the non-stimulated ear.\nThe electromyogram (EMG) was measured in a \u201320 to 80 ms\nwindow relative to the onset of the stimulus and bandpass \ufb01ltered\nbetween 10 and 1000 Hz. Visual feedback was given to the patient\nto maintain constant muscle tension. The \ufb01rst positive \u2013negative\npeak (p13 \u2013n23) of the averaged EMG was de \ufb01ned as the cVEMP\namplitude and normalized by the mean root-mean-square EMG\nlevel. For every presentation, at least 200 stimuli were averaged.\nFor oVEMP recordings, electrode pairs were placed as bipolar\nmontage on the infra-orbital ridge 1 cm below the lower eyelid\ncontralateral to the stimulated side and about 2 cm caudal to the\ufb01rst electrode with the ground electrode placed on the forehead.\nThe patients were asked to look maximally upwards. The \ufb01rst\nnegative-positive peak (n10 \u2013p15) of the averaged EMG was\nde\ufb01ned as the oVEMP amplitude. For every presentation, at least\n100 stimuli were averaged. For cVEMPs and oVEMPs, ampli-\ntudes and latencies between the tumor-affected side and the non-\naffected side were analyzed.\nWord recognition with CI . For patients receiving a CI, hearing\nperformance was measured at \ufb01rst\ufb01t, and around 1, 3, 6, and\n12 months after surgery. Word recognition scores were measured\nat a sound pressure level of 65 dB SPL (WRS\n65) by the Freiburg\nmonosyllables and the Freiburg numbers test after blocking and\nmasking the contralateral ear with broad band noise, if applicable.\nStatistics and reproducibility . If data could not be obtained in\nthe de \ufb01ned postoperative test period of 12 months, they were\ncompleted by later recordings or treated as missing data. The\nrespective nwas reported. Preoperative and postoperative dis-\ntributions were compared with paired t-tests. Bonferroni cor-\nrection was applied if multiple comparisons were performed. The\nsigni\ufb01cance level was set to 5%. For all statistical calculations,GraphPad Prism software (Version 8, Graphpad Software, San\nDiego, CA, USA) was used.\nEthical approval . The study was approved by the responsible\nethics committee (approval numbers 2019-026 and 2019-050). All\nrelevant ethical regulations were followed, informed consent was\nobtained from all participants.\nReporting summary . Further information on research design is\navailable in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to\nthis article.\nResults\nParticipants . Between 2011 and 2020, 27 patients (29 \u201375 years,\n13 male, 14 female) with solely intracochlear schwannomas\nunderwent surgical tumor removal (Fig. 1), 23 with single stage\nand 2 with second stage cochlear implantation. Preoperatively, 25\npatients suffered from complete or functional deafness (indica-\ntion for CI). Two patients would have bene \ufb01ted from a hearing\naid but could not use it due to increase of tinnitus and dysacusia.\nHearing loss was due to sudden hearing loss in 6 of 27 (22%) or\nprogressive or recurrent sudden hearing loss in 21 of 27 (78%)\npatients. Four of 27 patients (15%) reported vertigo attacks in\ntheir medical history, with two patients having been hospitalized\ndue to their attacks. Five of 27 patients (19%) reported episodes of\ninstability. Eighteen patients complained about tinnitus (four\npatients with pulsating tinnitus), while information about tinnitus\nwas not available for nine patients.\nPostoperative dizziness and vertigo varied between none to\nlasting for ~2 weeks. Only one patient continuously suffers from\nincompletely compensated ipsilateral loss of vestibular function\n12 months after surgery, complaining about instability while\nwalking and lateral pulsion, but is driving his car without\ndif\ufb01culties. Other than this, no adverse events were observed.\nPostoperative of peripheral vestibular and auditory function .\nThe statistical analysis showed that there was no signi \ufb01cant dif-\nference between pre- and post-operative measures (VOR gain,\ncalorics) or between the two sides postoperatively (VEMPs). The\ndata for each individual patient is shown in Fig. 2. Numerical\nvalues and con \ufb01dence intervals are shown in Table 1. The inci-\ndence and direction of SPN did not change between pre- and\npostoperative testing (Fig. 2j).

Only two patients (10%)\ndeteriorated (Fig. 2i). The impulse response of the lateral semi-\ncircular canal, i.e., vHIT gain, was still normal after surgery in 22\nof 24 patients (92%). One patient improved slightly but the gain\nstayed abnormal. Two patients (8%) deteriorated (Fig. 2h). In the\nanterior and posterior planes, only 3 of 24 (13%) and 2 of 23 (9%)\npatients showed a deterioration to postoperative pathological gain,\nrespectively. In both planes, two patients improved slightly (8%\nand 9%, respectively) but the gain stayed abnormal; one patient\n(4%,) improved to postoperative normal results (Fig. 2e, g). Nor-\nmal otolith function of the saccule was observed postoperatively in\n18 of 22 patients (82%) to bone-conducted vibration (Fig. 2c, d).\nThe utricular function was normal in 19 of 22 patients (86%).\nOnly one of the three patients without oVEMPs had absent\nresponses on the ipsilateral side only, two patients had no\nresponses on both, ipsi- and contralateral side (Fig. 2a, b). Suc-\ncessful hearing rehabilitation with CI and continuous improve-\nment over 1 to 12 months was shown by word recognition at\nnormal speech level compared to maximum word recognition\n(WRS max) before surgery (Fig. 2f).Discussion\nThese results show that vestibular function was largely preserved\nin most patients after partial or subtotal removal of the cochlea\nand provide strong objective evidence that the human vestibular\nlabyrinth is far more resistant to trauma than widely believed.\nThe mechanisms and reasons for the observed phenomenon are\nyet unknown but may be explained by the anatomy of the inner\near\ufb02uids spaces and the physiology of mechanoelectrical trans-\nduction in the vestibular labyrinth.\nThe endolymphatic spaces of the cochlea and the vestibular\nlabyrinth are linked by a very thin tube, the ductus reuniens,\nconnecting the cochlear duct and the saccule, with a diameter of\n<0.2 mm at its narrowest portion (Fig. 2). We consider that this\nduct is probably sealed by the soft tissue packing after cochlear\nremoval. Due to the blockage of the ductus reuniens, the surgical\napproach to the cochlea spared major damage to the vestibular\nlabyrinth. Continuous endolymph leakage from the ductus\nreuniens, larger leakage from the saccule or postoperative infec-\ntion may explain the loss of vestibular function in 2 of the 27\npatients, who on the other hand suffered from vertigo symptoms\nor attacks already before surgery (the one with persisting\ninstability and lateral pulsion reporting hospitalization for vertigo\nTemporal\nboneSuperior\nmembranous ampullaEndolymphatic\nsacEndolymphatic\nduct\nUtricle\nSacculeApex\ncochleae\nCochlear\nduct\nScala\nvestibuli\nScala\ntympani\nDuctus\nreuniensSuperior \nsemicircular\ncanal\nLateral\nsemicircularcanal\nPosterior\nsemicircularcanal\nPosterior\nmembranous\nampullaSaccular\nduct\nUtricular ductStapes\nRound\nwindowCochlear\naquaeductFacial\nnerveipsilateral contralateral 0246cVEMPamplitudes\n(normalize d)n=22ns (p = 0.96)ns (p = 0.09)\n051015202530cVEMP latencies ( ms)\nipsilateral ( n=18)\ncontralateral ( n=22)ipsilateral ( n=19)\ncontralateral ( n=18)\np13 n23ns (p = 0.99)\nns (p = 0.82)ns (p = 0.59)ns (p = 0.10)\n051015202530oVEMPlatencies(ms)\nn10 p15 ipsilateral contralateral 0102030oVEMP amplitudes ( /g80V)n=22\n0.00.51.01.5Anterior vHIT ga inn=24 ns (p = 0.34)\npreop postop\n0.00.51.01.5Posterior vHIT gainn=23 ns (p = 0.10)\npreop postop-100-75-50-2502550Vest ibula rcaloric response\n(%) re. affected side\nisiplate ral\nreductioncontralat eral\nreduction\npreop postopn=20 ns (p = 0.98)\n0.00.51.01.52.0Lateral vHITgainn=24 ns (p = 0.46)\npreop postop -1.2 -0.4 0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6024681012Number of patientspreop\npostopn=20n=24\nto contralateral side to ipsilateral side0255075100Wordr ecogn ition score\n@65 dB SPL (%)a\ne\ng h ijfb cd\nfirst\nfittingpreop\nunaided\n(WRS max)136 1 2\nmonths postop\nFig. 2 Schematic illustration of the inner ear with the \ufb01ve vestibular receptors and the cochlea and results of functional tests before and after surgery.\nPostoperative otolith receptor function amplitudes and latencies are shown for utricle ( a,b) and saccule ( c,d) with data points for individual patients,\nmeans and 95% con \ufb01dence intervals.

The maintenance of endolymph K+homo-\neostasis is regulated through a \ufb01ne balance between secretion and\nabsorption by epithelial cells. The dark cell epithelium and sub-\nepithelial melanocytes of the vestibular division of the labyrinth\nare functionally comparable to the marginal and intermediate\ncells of the stria vascularis, respectively18\u201320. The molecular\nrepertoire required for endolymph K+secretion, speci \ufb01cally the\ntransporter and channel proteins NKCC1, KCNQ1, KCNE1,\nBSND and CLC-K, is shared between the dark cells in the ves-\ntibular labyrinth and the marginal cells of the stria vascularis of\nthe cochlea in mammals21. Based on the results of our study, we\nconclude that \u2014since the stria vascularis has effectively been\nremoved with the tumor \u2014there are suf \ufb01cient endolymph gen-\nerating cells in the vestibular labyrinth to keep the vestibularsensory organ functioning. This is also supported by \ufb01ndings, that\nvestibular gravity receptors are highly resistant to acute disrup-\ntion of endolymph secretion unlike the Organ of Corti in the\nauditory system\n22, were active, highly energy-consuming pro-\ncesses of cochlear outer hair cells guarantee active ampli \ufb01cation\nand non-linear compression of cochlear vibrations (reviewed in\nref.23). The active processes in the cochlea are likely a major\nreason for the asymmetry in the resilience of the vestibular\nlabyrinth compared to the cochlea to invasive and traumatic\nsurgery of the respective other system. Although hearingpreservation appears possible after major surgical trauma to the\nvestibular labyrinth in some cases6\u20139,11\u201313, translabyrinthine skull\nbase procedures are considered non-hearing preservation surgical\napproaches24. Even in lesser traumatic surgeries than transla-\nbyrinthine approaches, i.e., in vestibular implantation, hearing is\nreduced after implantation in a considerable number of\npatients25. An additional explanation for the vestibular labyrinth\nbeing more robust to traumatic cochlear surgery than initially\nthought, might be that vestibular receptors are phylogenetically\nolder than acoustic receptors (hearing)26.\nPreservation of vestibular function after major surgical trauma\nto the cochlea may depend on the surgical approach. For other\nsurgical approaches for intracochlear schwannoma removal than\nthe one used in our study27,28\u2014like \u201cpush-through \u201dor\u201cpull\nthrough \u201dtechniques (also called \u201cpipe cleaner \u201d,\u201cbeach towel \u201d,o r\n\u201cdental \ufb02oss\u201dtechniques28\u201331), no detailed, objective measures on\nthe preservation of vestibular function have been published. We\nspeculate, that similar results on preservation of vestibular func-\ntion can be obtained with these techniques, although complete\ntumor removal from the cochlea is less likely and growth of tumor\nremnants to the vestibule may cause problems later. If the tumoralready invades the vestibule with subsequent additional trauma at\nthis location during tumor removal, it appears very unlikely that\nthe function of the vestibular labyrinth can be preserved at all or to\nsuch an extent as described as in our study. However, this needs to\nbe investigated in the future.\nAlthough this study shows for the \ufb01rst time in a - considering\nthe rarity of the disease -large number of patients that vestibular\nfunction is not only able to be preserved but is most commonly\npreserved following partial or subtotal cochleoectomy through\nserial, state-of-the-art vestibular function testing, there areTable. 1 Functional test results before and after partial or subtotal cochlear removal.\nMeasurement N Mean Lower 95% CI\nof meanUpper 95% CI\nof meanN Mean Lower 95% CI\nof meanUpper 95% CI\nof mean\nvHIT gain Preoperative Postoperative\nLateral semicircular canal 24 1,00 0,93 1,10 24 1 0,88 1,1\nPosterior semicircular canal 23 0,75 0,66 0,84 23 0,83 0,73 0,93\nAnterior semicircular canal 24 0,88 0,81 0,95 24 0,83 0,74 0,92\nVideonystagmography\nSpontaneous nystagmus re. affected\nside (\u00b0/s)20 0,08 \u22120,28 0,43 20 \u22120,03 \u22120,39 0,34\nCaloric irrigation (% response re.\naffected side)20\u221217\u221226 \u22127,9 20 \u221217 \u221234 \u22121\ncVEMP\np13-n23 Amplitude ipsilateral (EMG\nnormalized)18 1.8 1.1 2.6\np13 Latency ipsilateral (ms) 18 15 14 16\nn23 Latency ipsilateral (ms) 18 25 24 25\np13-n23 Amplitude contralateral (EMG\nnormalized)22 1.6 1.1 2.2\np13 Latency contralateral (ms) 22 14 13 15\nn23 Latency contralateral (ms) 22 25 24 25\noVEMP\nn10-p15 Amplitude ipsilateral ( \u00b5V) 19 8.4 5.3 12\nn10 Latency ipsilateral 19 12 11 12\np15 Latency ipsilateral 19 16 15 17\nn10-p15 Amplitude contralateral ( \u00b5V) 18 6.1 3.6 8.7\nn10 Latency contralateral 18 12 11 13\np15 Latency contralateral 18 16 15 17\nSpeech perception in quiet\nWord Recognition Score (WRS, %),\nmaximum WRS preoperative and at\n65 dB SPL postoperative24 10.2 0.4 20.0 12a72.5 60.5 84.5\naat: 12 monthsCOMMUNICATIONS MEDICINE | https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-021-00036-w ARTICLE\nCOMMUNICATIONS MEDICINE |            (2021) 1:37 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-021-00036-w | www.nature.com/commsmed 5limitations. Complete functional test results for all \ufb01ve vestibular\nreceptors were not available for all patients. In addition, vestibular\nfunction was not evaluated by standardized patient-related out-\ncome measures. This was due to the variability of available testsover the 10-year course of the study and due to the retrospective\nnature of parts of the study. These aspects need to be addressed in\nfurther and follow up-investigations.\nIn summary, our observations demonstrate that the receptors for\nthe sense of hearing and balance are not only selectively activated,\nbut they are anatomically and physiologically separated enough, so\nthat the receptors for the sense of balance can withstand extensive\nsurgical manipulations to the cochlea. This result has important\nimplications for our understanding of the function and surgery of\nthe inner ear in general and for further advancements in neural\ninterfaces. A current disadvantag eo fc o c h l e a ri m p l a n t a t i o ni st h e\nnecessity to introduce a multielectrode array through a very small\nopening in the cochlea which then is pushed forward in the scala\ntympani around the modiolus with the spiral ganglion cells receiving\nthe electrical stimulation. This results in technical challenges and\nlimitations for electrode array design\n32. Our results open up new\npossibilities for future designs of neural interfaces for electrical or\noptical stimulation of the p eripheral auditory system.\nData availability\nSource data for the main \ufb01gures in the manuscript can be accessed as Supplementary\nData 1.
