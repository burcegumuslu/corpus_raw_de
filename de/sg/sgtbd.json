The underlying pathomechanism is still not fully understood and most often it remains idiopathic. One of its discussed causes is the disturbance of cochlear microcirculation that is either the primary cause but also considered to be the final common pathway of other aetiopathological factors.

The animal model allows simultaneous measurement of hearing threshold by brainstem evoked response audiometry, and cochlear blood flow by intravital microscopy. Furthermore, by a central venous catheter, blood samples can be taken, and application of medication is possible. A sudden hearing loss was induced by acute hyperfibrinogenemia.
