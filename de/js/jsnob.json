It can \nhappen to anyone, young or old, male or female, whether born here or immigrated. \nSome people hesitate to consult a psychotherapist because they feel uncomfortab-\nle talking about their feelings, particularly with a stranger. Others can\u2019t picture what takes place in psychotherapy, and others ask themselves if it even works.\nThis brochure, \u201cPaths to Psychotherapy\u201d, is therefore aimed first and foremost at \npeople who have never consulted a psychotherapist and who would like to find out \nabout the options available in case of mental health problems. Partners, friends and colleagues can also use the following pages for information purposes. This brochure \noffers easy-to-understand, scientifically proven information that you can rely on.*\n We would like to encourage the reader to talk to people they trust during an emoti-\nonal crisis, and to turn to a general practitioner or psychotherapist for help, as well.\nDon\u2019t hesitate to talk about emotional distress or to seek professional help when the \nemotional stress becomes too overwhelming to cope with. Mental ill health can be \ntreated just as successfully as physical ill health.\nBest wishes\n \nProf. Dr. Rainer Richter\nPresident of the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (BPtK)Imprint\nPUBLISHED BY\nBundespsychotherapeutenkammer\nKlosterstrasse 64, 10179 Berlin \nT: 030 278785-0 F: 030 278785-44 info@bptk.de \nwww.bptk.de \nREALISATION\nKomPart Verlagsgesellschaft \nGmbH & Co.

Mental ill health may reveal itself through mental \nor physiological symptoms and problems in relationships. \nPsychotherapy works by means of:\n\u2022  professionally structured conversations and a therapeutically structured rela -\ntionship between the psychotherapist and the patient\n\u2022 practical exercises\nPsychotherapy does not use medication. Psychotherapy\n\u2022  is intended to relieve and heal mental illness (see page 6: \u201cWhen should I seek professional help?\u201d).\n\u2022  is a scientifically evaluated treatment method that has been proven to be effec -\ntive (see page 27: \u201cDoes psychotherapy work?\u201d).\n\u2022  should be carried out only by psychotherapists who have successfully com -\npleted a state-regulated course of training and are thus licensed (Approbation) to practice (see page 8: \u201cWhere can I go when I need help?\u201d).\nAccording to the legislation concerning psychotherapists (the German  Psychothe -\nrapeutengesetz ), psychotherapy is \u201cthe occupation that is undertaken by means of \nscientifically approved psychotherapeutic methods in order to establish, heal or \nrelieve disorders that qualify as a disease for which psychotherapy is indicated\u201d. In \nscientific terms, psychotherapy is defined as a planned and controlled treatment \nprocess that can be described by means of teachable techniques and is based on a \ntheory of normal and aberrant behaviour.Paths to Psychotherapy\n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   4-5 15.11.12   10:536 72. When should I seek professional \nhelp? \nAlmost everybody experiences emotional ups and downs. Most people come to \nterms with it in their emotional lives on their own. Many of them confide in their \npartners and friends and in this way are able to restore their inner balance. Some -\ntimes, however, talking to people you are close to is not enough. If an emotional \ncrisis continues over many weeks, then a conversation with a psychotherapist is \nadvisable. \nA psychotherapist is able to find out how psychotherapy can help you to treat your mental health problems. Emotional distress can become too destructive if, for in -\nstance, you are permanently anxious or depressed, or suffer from physical comp -\nlaints for which no physiological cause can be found.\nFor example: Depression \nDepression would be diagnosed if, for example, you have been feeling down or have experienced almost no interest in or pleasure from practically any activity practi-\ncally every day for a period of two weeks. Separation from or the death of someone \nclose to you can trigger strong feelings of sadness, low spiritedness, despair or anger and helplessness as well. Experiences of migration, flight or even rape or tor -\nture will also cause strong feelings. This is a normal emotional reaction. The phase during which a person comes to terms with the loss of another person can differ in length, often lasting longer than the traditional \u201cyear of mourning\u201d. The loss often \ncontinues to be painful long after this period, particularly when the person in mour -\nning thinks about the partner or family member they have lost. What is important, however, is that the intensity of the pain or other such feelings decreases with time. \nIf this is not the case, if normal feelings and everyday life are still strongly affected and disrupted by the sadness even after a longer period of time, then it is advisable \nto seek help. \nRecognised mental illnesses \nDoctors and psychotherapists have agreed on an internationally recognised list of \nwhat are called \u201cmental illnesses\u201d. These recognised mental illnesses can be found in a so-called ICD-10 list. This ICD-10 list is an internationally recognised classification \nof all physical and mental illnesses. It was compiled by the World Health Organi-\nsation (WHO) and is mandatory in Germany. The mental illnesses are distinguished according to which symptoms the patient is currently suffering from. In many ca -\nses, patients are found to be suffering from more than one mental disorder at the same time. More detailed information on specific mental illnesses is to be found \non the website (www.bptk.de) of the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (Bun -\ndespsychotherapeutenkammer) under \u201cPatients\u201d (Patienten) . There you will find an \noverview of \u201cMental Disorders from A to Z\u201d (Psychische St\u00f6rungen von A bis Z). \nInitial questions to ask yourself:\nIf you would like to check more closely whether psychotherapy might be ad -\nvisable for you, then you might find the following list of questions helpful:\n\u2022  This doesn\u2018t feel like me! Do I feel different from the way I normally feel?\n\u2022  Does this change worry me?\n\u2022  Is there an explanation for the change?\n\u2022  Is that explanation sufficient to clarify the duration and intensity of the \ncomplaint?\n\u2022  Am I finding that I can\u2018t cope with my daily work without difficulty? \n\u2022  Do I worry constantly and do I feel a lot of anxiety?\n\u2022  Am I suffering from any physical complaints?\n\u2022  Is my sleep disrupted, do I sleep too little or too much?\n\u2022  Do I often feel aggressive, full of hatred, or irritated, or am I very intolerant? \n\u2022  Am I often on sick leave?\n\u2022  Do I have suicidal thoughts?\n\u2022  Is there hardly anyone I can talk about my problems with?\n\u2022  Does talking to friends no longer help me to find my inner balance?\n\u2022  Is the change in me obvious to others?\n\u2022  Has this been going on for more than three months?\n\u2022  Do I feel as though none of this matters? \nSource: Rosemarie Piontek: Mut zur Ver\u00e4nderung.

Where can I go when I need help? \nIn case of an ongoing emotional crisis you will find help in psychotherapists\u2018 practi-\nces, outpatient departments and hospitals which take care of mental health, as well \nas in psychosocial counselling centres. \nNot just anyone can call themselves a \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d (Psychotherapeut) . \u201cPsy-\nchotherapist\u201d is a legally protected professional title. A person may only call them -\nselves a psychotherapist if they have successfully completed state-regulated training and if they treat mental illnesses using a scientifically approved psychothe -\nrapeutic method. Only psychological psychotherapists (Psychologische Psychothe -\nrapeuten) , child and youth psychotherapists (Kinder- und Jugendlichenpsychothe -\nrapeuten)  and medical psychotherapists  (\u00c4rztliche Psychotherapeuten) are allowed \nto call themselves psychotherapists. \nPsychological psychotherapists\nPsychological psychotherapists (Psychologische Psychotherapeuten)  treat children, \nyoung people and adults. They have first completed a Masters degree in psychology \nat a university and then received a licence to practice as a psychotherapist (Appro -\nbation) after completing a three-to-five-year state-regulated training in psycho -\ntherapy. Licensed psychologists (Diplom-Psychologen)  have a Masters degree in psycho -\nlogy, but no additional training in psychotherapy. They are employed primarily in research, in human resources departments, by psychological service providers or \ncounselling centres and in business consulting. \nChild and youth psychotherapists\nChild and youth psychotherapists (Kinder- und Jugendlichenpsychotherapeuten) \nare allowed to treat patients who are no older than 20. They have first completed \na degree in education or social education at a university or a university of applied \nsciences or a Masters degree in psychology, and afterwards completed a three-to-five-year state-regulated training in psychotherapy and are thus licensed to practi-\nce (Approbation) . \nHow can I find a psychotherapist? \nYou can find a psychotherapist in your area on the website of the State Cham -\nbers of Psychotherapists (Landespsychotherapeutenkammern). Here you can conduct a search by, for instance, typing in your postcode (Postleitzahl). You will then receive a list of psychotherapists in your postal area. You can be certain \nthat the psychotherapists named in the lists are medically licensed (Approbati -\non) and may thus call themselves psychotherapists. However, not all medically licensed psychotherapists have the accreditation of the association of statutory \nhealth insurance physicians (Kassenzulassung). If you wish to find a psychothe -\nrapist whose treatment can be billed to a statutory health insurance fund (Psy -\nchotherapeut mit Kassenzulassung), please ensure that you limit your search accordingly and tick the relevant box. \nIf you can, however, prove that you were unable to find a psychotherapist with \nthe accreditation of the statutory health insurance who has the capacity to treat you, then you have a legal right under certain conditions to have the cost \nof your treatment by a self-employed office-based psychotherapist reimbursed \nby your health insurance (see page 31: \n\u201cReimbursment of costs \u201d). In this case do \nnot tick the relevant box when doing a search. \nA list of the state chambers of psychotherapists can be found at the end of this \nbrochure (page 38).\nGeneral practitioners (Haus\u00e4rzte)\nMany people visit their general practitioner (Hausarzt)  first when they are suffe -\nring from emotional problems, either because they already know them or because \nthey are initially aware of the physical symptoms which have arisen from emotional \ndistress. If this is the case, they report symptoms such as sleep problems, stomach \npains or palpitations to their doctor. Mental illnesses often also involve physical \ncomplaints. The general practitioner investigates whether an organic origin for the complaint can be ruled out and whether the complaint can be traced back to a men -\ntal illness. If the latter, your doctor will advise you to consult a psychotherapist so that you can be examined more carefully and to find out whether you are having a \nmental illness and, if this is the case, what specific mental illness it is.3. Where can I go when I need help?\n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   8-9 15.11.12   10:5310 11Medical psychotherapists (\u00c4rztliche Pychotherapeuten)\nMental illnesses are also diagnosed and treated by specialist physicians, in particu -\nlar specialists in psychiatry, neurology or psychotherapy (Facharzt f\u00fcr Psychiatrie \nund Neurologie/Facharzt f\u00fcr Psychotherapie) as well as specialists in psychosomatic \nmedicine and psychotherapy (Facharzt f\u00fcr psychosomatische Medizin/Facharzt f\u00fcr psychotherapeutische Medizin) .\nThese doctors have studied medicine at university and afterwards completed a course of training in the treatment of mental illnesses. They can, amongst other things, prescribe medication and conduct sessions in psychotherapy.  \nOutpatient clinics  (Ambulanzen)\nIn addition to the psychotherapists\u2018 practices, outpatient clinics (Psychotherapeuti -\nsche Ambulanzen)  are available. You can go to one of these clinics directly. Amongst \nthese clinics are those located at universities, which are as a rule attached to an institute for clinical psychology or psychotherapy at that university, as well as psy-\nchotherapeutic outpatient clinics that belong to a hospital and outpatient clinics at \ntraining institutes for psychotherapists. \nPsychiatric and psychosomatic treatment in hospitals\nTreatment in a hospital (Krankenhaus)  should be considered by patients when their \nillness is particularly serious and therapy on an outpatient basis is not enough or \ndoes not lead to improvement. The advantage of inpatient treatment (station\u00e4re \nBehandlung)  is above all that various treatment methods can be carried out in com -\nbination. For example, psychotherapy is conducted both individually and in groups \nin this context, and relatives can also be involved. \nHospitalised treatment can also have an additional advantage: in a clinic, it is pos -\nsible to put some distance between yourself and those conflicts weighing on you at work or at home that could get in the way of the treatment of mental illnesses. After the end of a stay in hospital, however, you have to learn how to cope with these \npressures once again, and to stabilise the improvements that you have achieved. \nThis means it is usually necessary to have follow-up outpatient therapy. You can \ngenerally choose between various clinics for mental illnesses. In Germany there are: \n\u2022  hospitals for psychiatry and psychotherapy (Krankenh\u00e4user f\u00fcr Psychiatrie und \nPsychotherapie)\n\u2022  hospitals for psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy (Krankenh\u00e4user f\u00fcr Psychosomatische Medizin und Psychotherapie)\n\u2022  general hospitals with the relevant specialist units (Allgemeinkrankenh\u00e4user mit \nentsprechenden Fachabteilungen)\n\u2022  psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics (Psychosomatische Rehabilitationskliniken) .All inpatient facilities work with treatment concepts that may be put together out of a variety of building blocks such as psychotherapy (individually or in groups), \nmedication, ergotherapy, creative therapy methods (such as art or music therapy), \nphysiotherapy, and sport/movement therapy. \nA variety of professionals work together closely as a team in a hospital, including physicians, psychotherapists, specialised therapists (such as ergotherapists) and \nnursing staff. Whereas in psychiatric units a combination of medication and psy-\nchotherapeutic interventions is usually to be found that can differ greatly in their \nweighting, psychosomatic units place an emphasis on psychotherapeutic treatment \nconcepts. \nPsychosocial counselling centres  (Psychosoziale Beratungszentren)\nYou can also turn to psychosocial counselling centres in the case of a conflict or cri-sis. They offer help with coping with issues that a person sometimes can\u2018t deal with \non their own any more. Counselling centres are usually specialised and are aimed at \nparticular people such as:\n\u2022  children, young people and parents\n\u2022  couples and families\n\u2022  chronically ill people\n\u2022  women\nor they have a particular focus on issues such as:\n\u2022  pregnancy\n\u2022  sexuality\n\u2022  addiction\n\u2022  (anti-)discrimination\n\u2022  trauma (for example: rape, torture)\nBoth social workers and social education workers as well as psychotherapists work in counselling centres. These centres are supported by cities and communities or churches as well as charity organisations and associations. Consultations are usu -\nally free of charge. The psychosocial services on offer can be used by anyone whose everyday conflicts threaten to overwhelm them. They are aimed at people experien -\ncing normal life crises and problems. You can find the addresses of these centres in the local telephone book, the local paper or on the internet, usually under the heading \u201cBeratung\u201d  (counselling). Paths to Psychotherapy 3. Where can I go when I need help? \n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   10-11 15.11.12   10:5312 13Special help for chronically ill people \nMental illnesses are not usually treated in social psychiatric centres (sozialpsych -\niatrische Zentren) . These centres instead advise and support people with mental \nillnesses in their everyday lives, and help in case of a crisis. They also help to make \na workable daily schedule and activities possible, prepare rehabilitation measures, facilitate working together with relatives, and help with problems at work. You can \nfind the addresses of these social psychiatric centres on the internet on the websi-\ntes of local health services. \nAlternative health practitioners offering psychotherapy  \n(Heilpraktiker f\u00fcr Psychotherapie)\nAlternative health practitioners  (Heilpraktiker)  are not licensed  (Approbation)  to \npractice medicine, but rather have permission to practice according to alternative \nhealth practitioner legislation (Heilpraktikergesetz) . In order to gain this permission, \nthe applicant must be over 25, have proven that he or she has completed at least a secondary school degree (Hauptschulabschluss) , be morally responsible, suited to \npractice the profession from the point of view of health, and able to show, when \nexamined by the department of health concerning their knowledge and abilities, \nthat in practising alternative health methods he or she will not put the health of the \npopulation at risk. Alternative health practitioners with comprehensive permission to practice alter -\nnative health methods are allowed to identify physical and mental problems and conduct their own therapy in the form of physical treatments. They frequently use \nalternative or natural health methods for the purposes of diagnosis and therapy. \nSome alternative health practitioners have only limited permission to practice (Heil -\nkundeerlaubnis) in the field of psychotherapy. Alternative health practitioners are \nnot guaranteed to be sufficiently qualified to treat mental illnesses with scientifi-cally approved methods.The cost of psychotherapeutic treatment by an alternative health practitioner is not \ncovered by the statutory health insurance (Gesetzliche Krankenkassen) . Alternative \nhealth practitioners are not allowed to call themselves psychotherapists (Psycho -\ntherapeut) . They therefore often refer to their own practices as \u201calternative mental \nhealth practices\u201d  (Heilpraxis f\u00fcr Psychotherapie) and speak of themselves as \u201calter -\nnative mental health practitioners\u201d (Heilpraktiker f\u00fcr Psychotherapie) .\n4. What kind of psychotherapeutic \ntreatments do exist?\nPsychotherapeutic methods\nThere are a variety of psychotherapeutic methods available. The statutory health \ninsurance carries the costs of the following three: \n\u2022  analytical psychotherapy  (Analytische Psychotherapie)\n\u2022  psychodynamic psychotherapy (Tiefenpsychologisch fundierte Psychotherapie)\n\u2022  behaviour therapy (Verhaltenstherapie)\nThere are other psychotherapeutic methods that are scientifically recognised, how -\never the costs are not carried by the state health insurance companies:\n\u2022  client-centred therapy (Gespr\u00e4chspsychotherapie)\n\u2022  systemic therapy (Systemische Therapie)\nAnalytical psychotherapy  (Analytische Psychotherapie)\nAnalytical therapy is located within the tradition of classical psychoanalysis. It as -\nsumes that personal life experiences and above all conflictual unconscious ways of \ndealing with them can cause or serve to perpetuate mental illnesses. Life experien -\nces are above all shaped by our relationships with other people, in which the ear -\nly years are particularly formative. Once internalised and made unconscious, they influence a person\u2018s picture of themselves and other people as well as a person\u2018s \nfundamental attitude towards themselves and others. Additionally, feelings such as fear, shame, and aggression that are associated with extreme experiences that are \ndifficult to process emotionally can have an unconscious effect on how people sha -\npe their lives and relationships. As life continues, ingrained patterns of experience and behaviour come into being that unconsciously influence our feelings, thoughts \nand actions. If these life experiences lead to unconscious conflicts, mental and phy-sical complaints may develop. Paths to Psychotherapy\n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   12-13 15.11.12   10:5314 15In analytical psychotherapy, these life experiences, their processing, and their con -\nsequences for the present and everyday life are at the heart of treatment. Analytical \npsychotherapists help you to become aware of these unconscious processes and \nthus access those elements that are not comprehensible in order to experience them consciously. They ask you to describe what is going through your mind and \nhow you feel inside without evaluating or judging what you say. They pay attention \nnot only to what you say, but also to how you relate to yourself and your psycho -\ntherapist. During the course of treatment, a kind of pattern emerges which allows \nidentification of the way you interact with yourself and others. Additionally, it will \nbe determined whether this way of interacting, which made sense in the past, is still appropriate in your present life or whether it has persisted and led to an inap -\npropriate way of experiencing and behaving or to symptoms of disease. During the course of therapy, you can gain a deeper understanding of yourself and your way \nof interacting with other people in order to learn from these experiences and find \nways out of ever-repeating emotional dead ends. During a course of analytical therapy, as a rule you lie on a couch and have no eye \ncontact with your psychotherapist. This has the advantage that you are more free in \nyour thoughts and feelings and can more fully address your inner world, thoughts, feelings and inner pictures. Analytical psychotherapy is a long-term form of thera -\npy and takes two or more years. As a rule you agree to two or three therapy sessions a week with your psychotherapist. \nPsychodynamic psychotherapy (Tiefenpsychologisch fundierte  \nPsychotherapie)\nLike analytical psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy assumes that our life \nis not only shaped by our will but rather that everything that we feel, think and \ndecide also depends on unconscious psychic influences. These factors, which we are not aware of and cannot influence, include, in particular, inner conflicts which \ndetermine our later lives, especially if they were already present in our early years. \nEven a child experiences the normal human conflict between the wish to be inde -\npendent and self-sufficient on the one hand, and protected and cared for on the other. Sometimes a child cannot solve a conflict of this sort because he or she is af -\nraid of losing his or her mother or father. The intolerable conflict is then suppressed \nand forced into the unconscious in order for the child to protect him or herself \nfrom it. From here, however, the conflict continues to influence our feelings and \nthoughts and, above all, our relationships to other people. In a later life phase, when, \nfor instance, we experience a painful separation, these early unconscious conflicts can once again influence our feelings and behaviour and even make us mentally ill. \nA further cause of mental illnesses is also seen by the psychodynamic form of psy-\nchotherapy to be, for example, severe neglect, experiences of violence, or emotional coldness during the first years of life. Under such unfavourable life conditions, peo -\nple develop no or only limited abilities to form an image of themselves and of others with all their positive and negative qualities, to live in stable relationships, to control their own behaviour or to empathise with other people. \nUnconscious conflicts also determine the relationship to the psychotherapist. Psy -\nchotherapists who work psychodynamically help their patients to uncover the un -\nconscious factors behind their mental complaints. At the same time, they support \nthem in better solving their conflicts, thus enabling them to lead a healthier and less burdensome life. The dialogues demand a high level of openness and trust \nin the psychotherapist. Psychodynamic psychotherapy takes place in one-on-one \nconversations, generally once or twice a week, or in a group. This means of treat -\nment can include creative therapy methods (art, music or body therapy). A course of therapy can take between three months and two years.\nBehaviour therapy (Verhaltenstherapie)\nBehaviour therapy assumes that people differ in their susceptibility to mental ill -\nness on the basis of psychic and social characteristics which have developed in the \ncourse of their lives, as well as genetic and physiological factors. Against this back -\nground, distressing experiences or stress can trigger a mental illness. Other factors \ncan protect people against mental illness: for example, trusting stable relationships, \nthe ability to accurately perceive oneself and others, or the meaning that you see \nin your life or the tasks you perform. Reactions from the environment towards  Paths to Psychotherapy 4. What kind of psychotherapeutic treatments do exist?\n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   14-15 15.11.12   10:5316 17your mental problems,  \nyour own coping be -\nhaviour and the mo -\nmentum of mental \nillnesses all influence the further course of \nthe illness. \nIn behaviour therapy, the psychotherapist first works out with you an explanation \nfor why you have be -\ncome ill and why the \nillness has not healed \nof its own accord. You \nagree with him or her \non concrete therapy \ngoals and derive spe -\ncific means of treat -\nment from the causes and conditions of the illness, based on what the therapist suggests to you. A behaviour therapist encourages you to examine more closely how you see others or how you behave in particular situations, and to ask yourself \nwhat influence this has on how you are feeling and how this can be changed. For \nexample, he or she will help you to recognise negative thoughts and their influence \non your feelings and behaviour, and to try out helpful thoughts and ways of acting \non an everyday basis. This could mean, for instance, seeking a situation together with the psychotherapist that is outside their practice or the clinic and that causes \nyou anxiety. It could also mean that together with your psychotherapist you analyse \nand work with the way in which you see yourself or shape your relationships. The psychotherapist helps you to better understand the patterns of behaviour that you \nhave acquired over the course of your life and to make changes in order to relieve \nyour suffering. Behaviour therapy is particularly suitable for patients who like to work at concrete tasks. Behaviour therapists ask you, for instance, when and where \ndo the symptoms occur? How often and how strong are the symptoms? How long \ndo they last? How do you behave in these situations? Who is involved? What effects do the symptoms have? What would you like to achieve? What would you like to be \nable to do again?\nDuring behaviour therapy, you sit opposite the psychotherapist. The number and frequency of the therapy sessions are agreed upon between the patient and the \npsychotherapist according to the type of disorder. As a rule, the treatment takes six \nmonths to a year, and sometimes longer. \nClient-centred therapy (Gespr\u00e4chspsychotherapie)\nClient-centred therapy, also known as person-centred therapy (Gespr\u00e4chspsycho -\ntherapie, Klientenzentrierte Psychotherapie, Personenzentrierte Psychotherapie),  \nassumes that it is essential for a person\u2018s healthy development that his or her fun -\ndamental need for positive and unconditional esteem, particularly that of his or her parents, be fulfilled. Negative experiences and unfavourable developmental condi-\ntions in childhood can lead to a person developing a negative image of him or her -\nself. That person\u2018s ability to have constructive experiences and gain an increasingly good understanding of of him or herself and continue to develop can be limited by \nthis. Added to this are distressing living circumstances as well as possible problems with partnerships or at work. From the point of view of a client-centred therapist, \nmental problems develop when a person, mostly unconsciously, does not allow him \nor herself to accept feelings and experiences that are in contradiction to their self-image. \nClient-centred therapy assumes that everyone carries within themselves the abi -\nlity to develop and unfold positively. The patient is therefore, even in the case of \nmental illness, the person best able to analyse his or her personal situation and \nwork out solutions to his or her own problems. In client-centred therapy, the pa -\ntient is regarded as \u201cthe expert on him or herself\u201c. This is why self-exploration \nplays a central role in this form of therapy. According to this type of therapy, \nthe natural process of development and healing is supported in particular by the therapist empathising with the patient while avoiding judging them as far as pos -\nsible and giving him or her feedback. The psychotherapist accepts the patient unconditionally. This means that they consistently say yes to the person they are, \nto their nature, though without agreeing at the same time with every aspect of \nthe way they act. In the process, the psychotherapist and patient meet as equals and the psychotherapist approaches the patient in an open and honest manner. \nIn this way, they establish a climate that encourages development and that helps \nthe patient to become well again. These experiences and the skills newly gained \nduring the course of therapy also help the patient to find creative solutions for \nproblems in the future. Further developments in client-centred therapy emphasise in particular the patient\u2018s emotional experiences and focus on changing feelings \nand thoughts. In client-centred therapy, the patient and the psychotherapist sit \nopposite one another. The course of treatment usually takes six months to a year, with one therapy session per week. \nSystemic therapy  (Systemische Psychotherapie)\nIn systemic therapy, the focus is on the social context in which a mental disorder \ncomes into being \u2013 for example, the family. This is why a patient\u2018s partner or a child\u2018s \nparents are also included in the therapy. This form of therapy is not limited to wor -Paths to Psychotherapy 4. What kind of psychotherapeutic treatments do exist?\n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   16-17 15.11.12   10:5318 19king with biologically or legally defined families and couples, but also includes other \npeople who are important to the patient. \nThe psychotherapists will also want to know from those people who are important \nto the patient how they experience him or her and how their relationships are orga -\nnised. In the process, the psychotherapist attempts to understand how the patient \nbecame ill and what role is played here by the family or other social relationships \nand communication structures, but also what dynamic has come into being in the family as a result of the serious mental illness of one of the family members. \nThe psychotherapist works together with you to find a solution for your problems \nand makes you aware of your strengths. Systemic therapy, for instance, works with \nfamily sculptures: the patient positions members of his or her family in the form \nof symbolic figures in relation to each other so that the emotional relationships between them as he or she sees them are expressed. A family sculpture can make \ninvisible bonds and deadlocked communication processes visible. Conflicts within \nrelationships and harmful bonds can thus be better recognised and worked with.Systemic therapy assumes that the improvement of mental problems is initiated \nwithin the therapy sessions, but that the decisive changes take place between the sessions. The period of time between sessions may therefore also be longer. At the start of therapy, it can be one to two weeks long, and towards the end up to six or \neight weeks. Altogether, systemic therapy doesn\u2018t usually consist of more than 25 \ntherapy sessions. However, long-term therapies can also be conducted. The indi -\nvidual therapy appointments take place in the form of single or double sessions. \nMedication\nPsychotherapists do not prescribe medication. Psychotropic drugs are medicines \nthat affect a person\u2018s central nervous system and can thus relieve states of anxiety, tension, or depression. Many psychotropic drugs can, however, have side effects, \nand some lead to physical dependence after being taken for long periods of time. \nMedical treatment alone is usually not sufficient in order to heal a mental illness.\nIn most cases of mental illness, psychotherapy works just as well, if not better. In \naddition, there are some mental illnesses for which there is no specific medication, such as eating disorders or borderline personality disorder. Psychotherapy is the \ntreatment method that most strongly employs your ability to heal yourself and \nfosters independence. People who are treated with psychotherapy remain mentally stable more frequently and for longer. In the case of many mental illnesses, psy-\nchotherapy is more effective than treatment with medication alone. Sometimes, \nhowever, a combination of psychotherapy and medication is advisable. \nPaths to Psychotherapy 4. What kind of psychotherapeutic treatments do exist?\n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   18-19 15.11.12   10:5320 215. What happens during  \npsychotherapy?\nPsychotherapists diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Psychotherapists may dis -\ncuss your current emotional problems with you; they can help you to recall past \npainful experiences and to work through them; or they can help you to clarify con -\nflictual relationships and consider with you how you could behave differently in \nstressful situations. \nPsychotherapists work on two levels:\n\u2022  by means of the therapeutic relationship, which develops during the therapy \n\u2022  by means of techniques for reflection and practical exercises that you learn du -\nring therapy\nGoing to a psychotherapist directly\nYou can turn to a psychotherapist directly. You need only your health insurance \ncard. You do not need a referral from a general practitioner or specialist. If you do \nnot know any psychotherapists, you can ask friends or acquaintances or use the \nwebsites of the state chambers of psychotherapists (Psychotherapeutenkammer) or regional associations of statutory health insurance physicians (Kassen\u00e4rztiche \nVereinigung) (see the list on page 38). \nInitial interviews \u2013 without submitting an application\nThe psychotherapist agrees with you on an initial appointment for an interview, \nduring which he or she will spend 50 minutes\u2018 time with you. Initial interviews are \nfor the purpose of getting to know each other and finding out whether you have \na complaint that needs treatment. The psychotherapist asks you what mental pro -\nblems you are suffering from, how long you have been suffering from them, how \nthey make you feel in your everyday life, and what you have done so far in order to \ncope better. He or she will also ask you why you want psychotherapy, and what you expect from the treatment. He or she asks you this in order to better understand \nyour motives and expectations, and in order to check whether he or she can actu -\nally help you. Some psychotherapists use questionnaires and psychological tests during this phase. The most important thing about these initial interviews is that you also get an \nimpression as to whether you can speak openly and confidently with the psycho -\ntherapist. You should also be able to talk to him or her about subjects that may be \nembarrassing or painful to you or that make you anxious.In order for psychotherapy to be successful, it is very important that you can con -\nfide in the psychotherapist. If you are not sure after the first appointment, you can \nagree on further sessions or seek another psychotherapist. You have between five \nand eight sessions for these initial interviews. These first meetings are called \u201cprobationary sessions\u201d (probatorische Sitzungen) . \nYour health insurance covers the costs of these sessions in any event. In order for the psychotherapist to be able to bill these sessions, you must take your health \ninsurance card with you. If you have not been seeing a doctor during this quarter, \nyou also have to pay a quarterly practice charge (Praxisgeb\u00fchr) of \u20ac10 to the psy-\nchotherapist. You do not, however, have to submit an application to your health \ninsurance at this time. \nPatients\u2018 questions\nYou can use the initial interviews to ask the therapist questions. Ask him or her all \nof the questions that are important to you and that you want to clarify or at least \naddress in order to decide whether you want to be treated through psychotherapy. \nMany patients ask the following questions:\n\u2022  Is the psychotherapist entitled to bill the health insurance companies?\n\u2022  What costs might I as a patient possibly have to cover myself?\n\u2022  What about when I have to cancel an appointment?\n\u2022  What are the individual treatment sessions like?\n\u2022  How long does the course of treatment take?\n\u2022  What experience does the psychotherapist have in treating the mental illness concerned?\n\u2022  How successful can the treatment be?\n\u2022  What treatment alternatives do I have?\nProfessional secrecy (Schweigepflicht)\nWhat you discuss with your psychotherapist is not passed on to anyone else \u2013 not to your employer and not to your health insurance. Psychotherapists are bound by 5. What happens during psychotherapy?\n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   20-21 15.11.12   10:5322 23an oath of professional secrecy, which means that it is forbidden for them to pass \non personal information about patients to others without the patient\u2018s explicit ag -\nreement  (\u00a7 203 Strafgesetzbuch) . A breech of this confidentiality is punished with \nup to a year of imprisonment or a fine. \nThe diagnosis\nIt is a precondition of psychotherapy that you have a diagnosis of a mental illness. \nPsychotherapists make a diagnosis according to the ICD-10 list \u2013 for example, F32, \n\u201cdepressive episode\u201d, or F40.0, \u201cagoraphobia\u201d. Ask your psychotherapist to explain the diagnosis to you in terms that you can understand. \nTreatment plan and patient agreement\nPsychotherapists ask you expressly after the first \u201cprobationary\u201d sessions whether you agree to treatment. They will suggest a specific treatment to you, explain the al -\nternatives, and agree on the goals of the treatment with you. Psychotherapists will explain to you which psychotherapeutic methods they use in treatment. They may \nexplain the advantages and disadvantages of an additional or alternative treatment \nusing medication. \nThe health insurance application\nIn order to be treated, you must submit an application to your health insurance. The insurance has to approve the application before you can begin treatment. The insu -\nrance will cover only the cost of a treatment that has been approved. You can get the application form as well as further information from your psychotherapist. He or she will help you fill in the application. You will need to sign the form. \nPsychotherapists must also write a report in which they give reasons as to why they \nthink that treatment is necessary. This report is then examined by an expert who \nis a psychotherapist him or herself. This expert report procedure is called \u201cGutach -\nterverfahren\u201d  in Germany. The health insurance itself will not, however, be able to \nread the report. If your health insurance agrees to cover the cost of treatment, you can start psy-\nchotherapy. If the expert rejects the application, the patient and the psychothera -\npist can contest the decision together.With regard to short-term therapies, which include up to 25 therapy sessions, the expert report process usually does not take place, but you must nevertheless submit \nan application to your health insurance. Treatment\nPsychotherapy does not work overnight. You should therefore prepare yourself for a \nperiod of treatment lasting several months, during which you will have at least one \nsession of 50 minutes a week with your psychotherapist. \nThe first working phase is about understanding your illness better, about getting a clearer idea of what will happen during treatment, and about developing a trusting \nrelationship with your psychotherapist. Together with you, the psychotherapist will \nseek solutions for your most pressing conflicts and comp -\nlaints. The middle phase of the the -\nrapy, which makes up the gre -\nater part of the treatment, is \nabout dealing with concrete \nproblems and finding new ways of coping with them. \nYou will try out unaccusto -\nmed ways of behaving and \nhave new experiences. You \nwill understand your prob -\nlems better and learn to re -\ncognise your \u201ctypical pat -\nterns\u201d. Maybe you will mourn \nlosses or changes that you \nhave suffered or you are able \nto allow suppressed feelings to emerge, can express them \nand give them a direction.\nThe emphasis and contents of the psychotherapy will be very different from in -\ndividual to individual, according to what you have experienced and which coping strategies you have developed so far, which abilities you bring with you, and which approach suits you. \nDoubt and difficult phases\nMental illnesses can be treated. Most mental illnesses, however, have come into being over a long period of time. Sometimes months or even years are needed \nfor their treatment. However, it is possible to no longer have excessive anxiety, no \nlonger be constantly preoccupied with distressing thoughts, or to stop drinking \nalcohol. Changes in interpersonal conflicts or habitual thought and behaviour pat -\nterns are not easy to achieve. But psychotherapists are very experienced in under -\nPaths to Psychotherapy 5. What happens during psychotherapy?\n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   22-23 15.11.12   10:5324 25standing other people and \nhelping them to sort out \nemotional problems. Your \npsychotherapist will also \nshow you how you can help yourself in future by learning \nto better recognise distres -\nsing situations and thus deal \nwith them better so that they do not make you ill.However, not every treat -\nment is successful. If you are not happy with the progress being made in psychothera -\npy, then this is a reason to talk to the therapist about \nthe treatment and possible \nalternatives. Ask him or her any questions you may ha -\nve. Speak directly about your doubts and seek a common decision about further treat -\nment. As a rule, treatment of a men- \ntal illness takes longer, the \nlonger you have been ill and the more frequent the symp -\ntoms are. An anxiety disorder can therefore sometimes be better treated than a depression that you have had since your youth. Treatment can also take longer if you have several mental illnesses \nat the same time or if you know no one who can support you. Some mental illnesses \nalso become chronic, which means that they do not disappear completely. \nSide effects\nAs with other treatments, effects can emerge in psychotherapy that are unintentio -\nnal and disadvantageous for the patient. The mental symptoms can become worse, \nor new symptoms can emerge, leading to a state of being overwhelmed or a feeling \nof being dependent on the psychotherapist.\nThere has so far been little investigation into the side effects of psychotherapy. \nAccording to the studies that do exist, it is assumed that about one in every ten pa -tients is worse off after therapy than they were before. The greatest risk factor for failed therapy is a problematic relationship with the psychotherapist. It is therefore crucial that you pay attention to the \u201cchemistry\u201d when looking for a therapist. If you \ndon\u2018t feel comfortable with the therapist, you should look for another. \nYou can also, however, end a course of therapy at a later point if you have been dissatisfied for a while and seriously doubt that the therapy will be successful. The \nlength of a course of therapy does not depend on the number of hours that have \nbeen approved by the health insurance. Professional psychotherapists respect your decision. You can end any course of therapy at any time. You can also change your \npsychotherapist. \nThe end of treatment\nAt the start of treatment, treatment goals are agreed upon together and the treat -\nment plan is explained. It should therefore be clear to you when these goals have been achieved. \nYou can recognise a successful course of therapy by the fact that you actually feel better, that the symptoms are receding, and that you are more aware of your own \nstrengths. Good psychotherapists do not work with you longer than necessary, and \nin the end make themselves redundant. \nThe end of therapy always means taking leave. The psychotherapist was probably an \nimportant person for you for a while. Maybe you will experience the end as a loss. It can be a good idea to discuss this subject during the final therapy sessions and \nfocus on the feelings and early experiences associated with this. \nThe last phase of treatment is about preparing you for the time after the treatment. The questions that might arise at this point could, for example, be: \n\u2022  What are the goals for your continued development?\n\u2022  What are you going to do in order to maintain what you have achieved and to continue to come closer to your long-term goals?\n\u2022  What can you do if your problems reappear or become more acute? \nOf course, psychotherapy does not get rid of every problem that you might be faced with. Life will continue to have its ups and downs. Psychotherapy can\u2018t change that. You may, however, notice a difference: the ups and downs don\u2018t bother you as \nmuch. You notice negative changes much earlier and are better able to take action \nagainst them. \nExtending treatment\nYou can also extend treatment if you and your psychotherapist are of the opinion that you are heading in the right direction but have not reached your goal yet. In \nPaths to Psychotherapy 5. What happens during psychotherapy?\n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   24-25 15.11.12   10:5326 27order to do this, an application for an extension (Verl\u00e4ngerungsantrag) based on \nexpert opinion has to be submitted to your health insurance. \nComplaints about your treatment\nPsychotherapists have passed a code of professional conduct for themselves. This \ncode regulates their professional rights and obligations. These regulations serve, \nfor example, to: \n\u2022  promote trust between patient and psychotherapist\n\u2022  ensure the quality of psychotherapeutic work\n\u2022  secure the protection of the patient\n\u2022  protect and promote the freedom and standing of the profession\nIn the chapter entitled \u201cWhat rights do I have as a patient?\u201d (page 34), you can learn \nin more detail what regulations psychotherapists must observe during treatment. Complaints can be made to the state chamber of psychotherapists (Landespsycho -\ntherapeutenkammer) responsible for you: there is a list of state chambers at the end \nof the brochure (page 38). The chambers have the task of investigating and penali-sing infringements of the professional code by their members. If psychotherapists \ninfringe the code of conduct, the responsible chamber may reprimand them, fine \nthem, and instigate professional law proceedings, which can go as far as revoking their licence to practice (Approbation). 6. Does psychotherapy work?\nPsychotherapy does work \u2013 this has been demonstrated. Its healing effect has been confirmed over the past decades by numerous international studies. For this reason, \nthe costs are covered in Germany by the statutory health insurance. \nResults of psychotherapy research\nThe effectiveness of psychotherapeutic treatment has been researched scientifi-\ncally and confirmed for almost all mental illnesses. It is well established that psy-\nchotherapy works for disorders such as anxiety disorders, depression, addiction, \npersonality disorders, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders and atten -\ntion deficit and hyperactivity disorders (ADD/ADHD). The studies show that pati-\nents who have had psychotherapy achieve not only a clear short-term reduction in \npsychological distress and improvement in quality of life, but also experience long-\nterm, stable positive treatment outcomes. \nStudies on depression, for example, were able to show that depressive phases are considerably shortened by a course of psychotherapy and the risk of becoming \ndepressed again is halved. Studies on panic disorders were able to show that more \nthan 80 percent of patients treated with psychotherapy were doing better than those treated routinely. According to a recent meta-analysis, it is also the case that \npsychotherapy was able to bring about a clear improvement in 45 percent of pati-\nents with a generalised anxiety disorder compared with only 14 percent of patients \nwho received routine treatment. Similar successes with psychotherapy could be \nshown for a broad spectrum of mental illnesses.The so-called effect size has become the established measure for describing the \neffectiveness of treatments. According to global surveys, the average effect size for \npsychotherapies constitutes 0.88. Psychotherapy thus has a higher probability of succeeding than, for instance, bypass operations (0.8). \nTreatments with an effect size of more than 0.8 are rated by scientists as very effec -\ntive. An effect size of 0 means that there is no impact, 0.2 means a limited impact, \nPaths to Psychotherapy\n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   26-27 15.11.12   10:5328 29and 0.5 means a medium impact. Put differently, this means that a patient who un -\ndergoes psychotherapy has comparatively a very high chance of feeling noticeably \nbetter within a few months. \nScientific advisory board for psychotherapy\nNot all psychotherapeutic methods and techniques have been scientifically appro -\nved. In Germany, whether a psychotherapeutic method can claim that it is \u201cscien -\ntifically approved\u201d is decided by the scientific advisory board for psychotherapy (Wissenschaftlicher Beirat Psychotherapie) . \nSix experts from the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (Bundespsychothe -\nrapeutenkammer)  and six from the German Medical Association (Bundes\u00e4rzte -\nkammer) are in this committee. Following fixed regulations, it examines whether \nenough scientific investigations have been carried out that prove the effectiveness of a method. Only then can this psychotherapeutic method be regarded as scienti-fically approved. \nOne study alone is not enough. The studies must additionally fulfil scientific stan -\ndards, which means that they must have been conducted using a sufficiently lar -\nge number of patients. They must also, however, have shown the effectiveness of \nthe psychotherapeutic method by having compared a group of patients who were \ntreated with a group of patients who were not treated. It is also important that it \nwas previously established beyond doubt that the patients were ill before receiving treatment. Of course, a psychotherapeutic method is not allowed to cause damage.If ten percent of the studies show that a method has \u201cconsiderable damaging ef -\nfects\u201d, then the method has failed.The scientific advisory board for psychotherapy has so far given scientific recogni-tion to the following psychotherapeutic methods: \n\u2022  behaviour therapy  (Verhaltenstherapie)\n\u2022  psychodynamic psychotherapy (Psychodynamische Psychotherapie) , consisting \nof the so-called \u201cguideline methods\u201d approved by the statutory health insurance: \nanalytical psychotherapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy (Analytische Psy -\nchotherapie und Tiefenpsychologisch fundierte Psychotherapie)\n\u2022  client-centred psychotherapy (Gespr\u00e4chspsychotherapie)\n\u2022  systemic psychotherapy (Systemische Therapie)\nFederal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss)\nPsychotherapeutic methods that are paid for by the statutory health insurance first \nhave to be examined by a further committee. The statutory health insurance on -\nly pays for forms of psychotherapy that have been checked by the Federal Joint Committee  (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss, G-BA).  In the G-BA, physicians, psy-chotherapists, hospitals and health insurances decide together which medical treatments are to be paid for by the statutory health insurance companies. Patient \nrepresentatives have an advisory role in the meetings. The G-BA examines whether \npsychotherapeutic methods are useful and whether they are medically necessary and efficient. \nThe G-BA approves to be paid for by the statutory health insurance only those \npsychotherapeutic treatment methods whose efficacy in the case of the most fre -\nquently occurring mental illnesses has been proven. These include, for example, de -\npression, anxiety and somatoform disorders \u2013 that is, physical complaints for which no organic cause can be found. From the viewpoint of the G-BA, a \u201cbroadly based qualification\u201d is thus ensured for psychotherapists with regard to the most frequent \nmental illnesses. It is particularly the case with mental illnesses that a large number \nof disorders emerge at the same time, so it must be ensured that psychotherapists are properly able to provide professional treatment. The G-BA has thus far approved \nthe following psychotherapeutic methods as being effective:\n\u2022  analytical psychotherapy (Analytische Psychotherapie)\n\u2022  psychodynamic psychotherapy (Tiefenpsychologisch fundierte Psychotherapie)\n\u2022  behaviour therapy (Verhaltenstherapie)\nGuidelines\nSpecialised treatment concepts or scientifically tested treatment guidelines (Be -\nhandlungseitlinien)  exist for many mental disorders. When all the most important \ngroups of experts in Germany have agreed on common treatment recommenda -\ntions for a particular illness on the basis of a systematic evaluation of research \nresults in the form of a structured procedure, then these are published under the \nname of S3 Guidelines (S3-Leitlinie),  or national disease management guidelines  \n(Nationale Versorgungsleitlinie) . \nIn the case of mental illness, only one such set of national disease management \nguidelines exists so far, which is for depression (www.depression.versorgungsleit -\nlinien.de).\nAltogether 31, professional associations as well as patient and relative representa -\ntives were involved in the development of these National Care Guidelines. In these guidelines you can find out, among other things, whether the experts would tend \nto recommend psychotherapy or treatment with medication. In the case of mild depression, for example, the experts would recommend treatment consisting of \npsychotherapy alone, whereas for a major depression they would recommend a \ncombination of psychotherapy and medication. Further valid S3 Guidelines exist for the diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders \nand post-traumatic stress disorders (last updated: January 2012).Paths to Psychotherapy 6. Does psychotherapy work?\n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   28-29 15.11.12   10:5330 317. Who covers the costs?\nStatutory Health Insurance\nPsychotherapy is a service covered by the statutory health insurance in Germa -\nny. This means that health insurance pays for psychotherapy. All you need is your \nhealth insurance card. \nApplication\nPsychotherapy is a service that needs to be applied for (antragspflichtige Leistung) , \nwhich means that you must submit an application after the probationary sessions \n(Probatorische Sitzungen)  and before the start of treatment. The relevant form and \nfurther information can be obtained from your psychotherapist. As a rule, psycho -\ntherapists will take care of most of the paperwork for you. All you have to do is read through the form and sign it. You do need to have your health insurance card with \nyou, though. \nLicence to practice (Approbation),  accreditation (Zulassung),  \napproved methods  (Richtlinienverfahren)\nPsychotherapists must fulfil particular criteria in order to be able to bill the statuto -\nry health insurance companies.They must: \n\u2022  be licensed to practice (Approbation), that is, have the permission of the state to \ntreat people\n\u2022  be approved by an association of statutory health insurance physicians (Kassen-\u00e4rztliche Vereinigung)\n\u2022  use a psychotherapeutic method that has been proven scientifically to be effec -\ntive and is approved (Richtlinienverfahren)  \nSo far these methods include the following:\n\u2022  analytical psychotherapy (Analytische Psychotherapie)\n\u2022  psychodynamic psychotherapy (Tiefenpsychologisch fundierte Psychotherapie)\n\u2022  behaviour therapy (Verhaltenstherapie)\nIt is best to find out during your first meeting with a psychotherapist whether it is possible to bill a statutory health insurance for the treatment. As a rule, this can be \nfound out before the initial contact with the psychotherapist: \n\u2022  via the website of one of the state chambers of psychotherapists (Landespsycho -\ntherapeutenkammer)  \u2013 some chambers also offer patient information services \nthere as well\n\u2022  via the information service of the regional association of statutory health in -\nsurance physicians (Kassen\u00e4rztliche Vereinigung)  responsible, on the internet \n(search for \u201cPsychotherapeutensuche\u201d)  or by telephone\n\u2022  by enquiring at your health insurance office \nNo supplementary costs\nIf your health insurance grants your application for psychotherapy, then it will pay \nthe entire cost. You don\u2018t have to pay anything. If, however, you do not have a re -\nferral note from your general practitioner (Hausarzt), then you will have to pay the \npractice charge (Praxisgeb\u00fchr) . This is a quarterly flat-rate charge to patients for \ntreatment in the amount of \u20ac10.\nExtension\nA course of therapy can be extended. In order to do this, you will need to submit an application. \nApplication refused\nThe statutory health insurance may refuse an application. You can file an objection against a refusal of an application. If this objection is refused as well, you can sue via \nthe social court (Sozialgericht),  which is free of charge for everybody. \nReimbursement of costs\nThere are not enough psychotherapists who have been licensed by an association of \nstatutory health insurance physicians (Kassenzulassung) . Because of this, patients \noften have to wait for months, sometimes even longer, for treatment. However, if you can prove with documentation that you have contacted several psychothera -\npists and are in urgent need of treatment, then the statutory health insurance must \nreimburse the cost of treatment by psychotherapists who have not yet been ap -7. Who covers the costs?\n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   30-31 15.11.12   10:5332 33proved by an association of \nstatutory health insurance \nphysicians (Kassen\u00e4rztliche \nVereinigung) . These psy-\nchotherapists are licensed by the state to practice (Ap-\nprobation) , but do not have \nthe accreditation (Kassen-zulassung)  of a statutory \nhealth insurance physicians association. These psycho -\ntherapists work in a private practice. They will write you a bill, which you can then \nsubmit to your health insu -\nrance. However, you should get your health insurance\u2018s \napproval in writing for this kind of billing in the form \nof reimbursement of costs \nbeforehand. You can get further information about \nreimbursement of costs from your state\u2018s chamber of psychotherapists (Landes -\npsychotherapeutenkammer)  or from the internet at www.bptk.de. \nData protection\nThe application to your health insurance includes a report on what you are suffering \nfrom and your medical history. Neither your name nor other data that might reveal \nyour identity are included in this report. The report is made anonymously and is sent \nto the health insurance in a separate sealed envelope. The health insurance sends the unopened letter and possibly other documents relating to previous treatment \nto an expert who examines the reasons given for the application without knowing \nwho the person concerned is. \nPrivate health insurance\nThe services provided by the private health insurance are not uniformly regulated. What is decisive is what the person insured and their insurer have agreed on in their \ncontract. Many private insurances refuse to provide insurance cover for mentally \nill people or limit their cover in the case of mental illness. Like the statutory health insurance companies, the private insurance companies usually only reimburse the cost of treatment methods that have been scientifically approved (Richtlinienver -\nfahren) . It is in any case advisable to get confirmation in written form that the costs \nwill be reimbursed before beginning treatment.\nState subsidies\nIf you are a civil servant, part of the cost of treatment by an approved psychothe -\nrapist is subsidised by the state (Beihilfe) . In general, this amounts to about 50% of \nthe costs. In any case, it is advisable to get confirmation in written form that the costs will be reimbursed before beginning treatment.\nChild guidance counselling (Erziehungsberatung) for parents, child -\nren and young people \nThere are over 1,000 child guidance and family counselling centres (Erziehungs- und Familienberatungsstellen) in Germany. Counselling in these centres is strictly con -\nfidential and free of charge. Parents, children and young people looking for advice can contact a local centre directly. Child guidance counselling is frequently used for behavioural difficulties in children and young people and when they are having pro -\nblems at school. You can find the address of a counselling centre on the website of the \u201cBundeskonferenz f\u00fcr Erziehungsberatung\u201d (national conference on educational \ncounselling, www.bke.de). All you have to do is type in your postcode (Postleitzahl)  \nor place of residence (Wohnort) . \nSocial services department  (Sozialamt)\nIf you do not have health insurance and are in financial difficulties, you can also apply for psychotherapy through the social services department. \nSelf-paying patient (Selbstzahler)\nIf you pay for the psychotherapy yourself, then you will mainly be treated in the same way as if you were insured privately. The costs of treatment are decided by the \npsychotherapists\u2018 scale of charges and fees (Geb\u00fchrenordnung f\u00fcr Psychothera -\npeuten) . Before beginning treatment, you should come to a clear and ideally written \nagreement about the kind of treatment you want to receive, how long the treatment \nshould be, and how much it will cost.Paths to Psychotherapy 7. Who covers the costs?\n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   32-33 15.11.12   10:5334 358. What rights do you have as a  \npatient? \nGeneral patients\u2018 rights in Germany\nPatients have rights. Psychotherapists must inform patients about their rights and \nrespect these rights.\nThe Federal Ministry of Health (Bundesgesundheitsministerium)  has summarised \nthe legal situation for patients in a understandable form on their homepage (www.\nbmg.bund.de > Pr\u00e4vention > Patientenrechte).\nSome of the more important points that also apply to psychotherapists are:\n\u2022  The patient has a basic right to choose their doctor and hospital themselves and \nto change them. The patient is allowed to get a second medical opinion. \n\u2022  The patient has a right to decide on the kind of medical treatment and the extent of this medical treatment. The patient can decide whether he or she wants to be \ntreated. He or she also has the basic right to turn down a medical decision even if \nit appears medically advisable. \n\u2022  The doctor must inform the patient early enough before treatment and on prin -\nciple in the context of a personal consultation about the nature and extent of \ntreatment measures, explain the risks involved, and obtain the patient\u2018s permis -\nsion for this treatment. Forms and information sheets cannot replace the consul -\ntation.\n\u2022  Information, documents and data concerning the patient are to be treated con -\nfidentially by doctors, nursing staff, hospitals and health insurance companies. They can be passed on only with the agreement of the patient or on the basis of \nlegal regulations. \nRules of professional conduct\nPsychotherapists are obliged by law to be members of a state chamber of psycho -\ntherapists (Landespsychotherapeutenkammer) . Doctors who work as therapists are \nobliged to be members of a state medical council (Landes\u00e4rztekammer) . These are \npublic bodies. Each federal state has a state chamber of psychotherapists. The only exception is the East German chamber of psychotherapists (Ostdeutsche Psycho -\ntherapeutenkammer)  for the states of Brandenburg (Brandenburg) , Mecklenburg-\nWest Pomerania (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) , Saxony (Sachsen) , Saxony-Anhalt \n(Sachsen-Anhalt)  and Thuringia  (Th\u00fcringen).  The chambers regulate, amongst other \nthings, the professional rights and obligations of their members. These regulations are laid down in the so-called professional code of conduct (Berufsordnungen) . This \nprofessional code of conduct is obligatory for all members of the chamber. They serve for example to: \n\u2022  promote trust between patients and psychotherapists\n\u2022  ensure the quality of the psychotherapeutic occupation\n\u2022  ensure that the patient is protected\n\u2022  maintain and promote the freedom and standing of the profession \nRules of professional conduct (Regeln der Berufsaus\u00fcbung)  include: \nDuty of care (Sorgfaltspflichten)\nPsychotherapists must not take advantage of the trust, ignorance, gullibility, help -\nlessness or financial hardship of the patient or make unjustified promises or be \nunsuitably discouraging with regard to the success of the treatment. \nPatient consent  (Einwilligung)\nAll treatment must be consented to by the patient.\nInformation about treatment \nPsychotherapists inform their patients about: \n\u2022  indication\n\u2022  type of treatment\n\u2022  therapy plan\n\u2022  treatment alternatives where relevant\n\u2022  possible risks involved in treatment\n\u2022  fee structure\n\u2022  the duration of a single session\n\u2022  frequency of the sessions\n\u2022  the probable duration of the entire course of treatment8. What rights do you have as a patient? \n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   34-35 15.11.12   10:5336 37Fees (Honorierung)\nThe fee for self-pay patients and those insured privately should be calculated ac -\ncording to the regulation of fees for psychotherapists (Geb\u00fchrenordnung f\u00fcr Psy -\nchotherapeuten/GOP)  if not otherwise legally determined. Issues regarding fees are \nto be settled at the start of therapy or counselling. Any deviation from the legally \ndetermined fees (Honorarvereinbarungen) are to be in written form.\nProfessional secrecy \n(Schweigepflicht)\nPsychotherapists are obli -\nged to maintain professio -\nnal secrecy with what has become known to them or \nbeen confided to them by \npatients or third parties in \nconnection with their pro -\nfessional activity. Informati -\non about patients and third parties may be used only \nin an anonymous form in accordance with the fede -\nral laws on data protection (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz)  \nin the context of consulta -\ntion amongst colleagues, in -\ntervision, supervision or for the purposes of scientific \nresearch and teaching. \nAbstinence \nPsychotherapists are not allowed to abuse the relationship of trust with their pati-\nents in order to satisfy their own needs and interests. Their professional activities \nare to be compensated by means of the agreed fees alone. They may not be the \nbeneficiary of presents, attentions, inheritances or bequests, either directly or indi-rectly, unless their worth is negligible. \nThis rule of abstinence also applies to the time after the therapy has ended as long \nas a need for treatment or relationship of dependency still exists between the pa -\ntient and the psychotherapist. The psychotherapist alone is responsible for irrep -\nroachable professional conduct. Sexual contact is forbidden\nAny form of sexual contact between a psychotherapist and his or her patient is forbidden.\nProhibition of discrimination\nPsychotherapists are obliged to respect the dignity of their patients without dis -\ntinction of any kind such as sex, age, sexual orientation, social origin, nationality, race, religion or political opinion. Patients must not be discriminated against due to these criteria. Documentation of treatment and the patient\u2018s right to access this documentation:\nPsychotherapists are obliged to document treatment and counselling. This do -\ncumentation should contain at least the date, anamnestic data, diagnoses, case conceptualisations, psychotherapeutic measures and, where relevant, the results \nof psychometric tests. Patients have the fundamental right to be given access to this documentation on demand. This also applies after treatment has ended. Psy-\nchotherapists may refuse this access to documentation, entirely or in part, only if \nthis would be harmful to the health of the patient and this risk to health cannot be \nrelieved elsewhere. Reasons for this refusal of access must be given to the patient. \nPatient enquiries\nEnquiries by patients who are in the course of treatment must be responded to \npromptly, and immediately in the case of an emergency, as long as there is no spe -\ncial reason for not doing so. If the psychotherapist is prevented from doing so, al -\nternative possible contacts are to be provided.\nPractice premises\nThe rooms in which psychotherapists practice must be separate from their private living space.\nAny patient may make a complaint to a state chamber of psychotherapists (Lan -\ndespsychotherapeutenkammer)  about psychotherapists who are members of this \nchamber. The chamber is obliged to follow up every complaint and to examine whe -\nther conduct has taken place that has transgressed the professional code. A list of \nthese chambers can be found on the next page. \nPaths to Psychotherapy 8. What rights do you have as a patient? \n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   36-37 15.11.12   10:5338 399.

Speak to someone about \nhow you don\u2018t know how to carry on. Please don\u2018t keep it to your-\nself. It is these kinds of emotional crises that can quickly push people beyond their limits. Sometimes even small causes can have enormous \neffects.\n Turn to someone you know well. If you can\u2018t get hold of someone you trust right away, then you can turn to someone who knows a lot \nabout emotional crises and understands what you are going through. \nPartners, relatives, friends or colleagues can also get advice when they see that someone is in an acute crisis and they don\u2018t know what \nthey can do to help. \nIn such cases, it would be best to get help from the doctor or psycho -\ntherapist who treats you. If they cannot be reached at short notice, \nthen you can turn to the nearest psychiatric hospital\n (psychiatrisches \nKrankenhaus)  or general hospital (Allgemeinkrankenhaus)  with a \nspecialised department. \nIn addition, many towns and regions have set up a crisis service (Kri-\nsendienst)  to help people in an emotional crisis, and can be reached \n24 hours a day and will also come to your home if this is necessary. \nYou can find these crisis services on the internet as well, if you do a \nsearch using the term  \u201cKrisendienst\u201d  and add the name of your town, \nfor example,  \u201cKrisendienst Berlin\u201d . \n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   38-39 15.11.12   10:5340Bundespsychotherapeutenkammer\nKlosterstrasse 64, 10179 Berlinwww.bptk.de\n03_Bptk_Broschuere_englisch.indd   40 15.11.12   10:53", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
