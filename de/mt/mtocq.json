This need is proven by analysing a representative selection of\ncomprehensive present-day general bilingual dictionaries as well as by evaluating\noutputs from machine translation tools, both online and commercial. The doctoral thesis\nstarts with an outline of the different concepts, methods, sources and applications as\nregards collocations in both the contemporary and historical perspectives. Next,\ncollocations are discussed in the contrastive (English-German) light. Before embarking\non the discussion of the methods I have tested with a view to compiling such an\nEnglish-German adjective-noun dictionary, I outline the main principles of bilingual\nlexicography at large. By way of conclusion, the applicability of such a dictionary is\ntested along with the hypothesis as to the expansion possibility of the adjective-noun\ndictionary to other collocational structures.\nAbstract (German):\nKollokationen sind wiederholte, usuelle Wortkombinationen, deren Zusammensetzung\nsich meist nicht semantisch begr\u00fcnden l\u00e4sst, sondern vielmehr lexikalischen und\nkonventionalisierten Ursprungs ist. Kollokationen sind zudem gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils\nsprachenspezifisch, und auch ein engverwandtes Sprachenpaar wie das Deutsche und\ndas Englische weist eine Vielzahl an semantischen und strukturellen Unterschieden auf.\nAnhand von W\u00f6rterbuchanalysen und \u00dcbersetzungsmaschinen (online oder\nkommerziell) wird die Notwendigkeit eines zweisprachigen Kollokationsw\u00f6rterbuchs\ndeutlich gemacht. Zun\u00e4chst werden die unterschiedlichen Begriffe, Methoden, Quellen\nund Anwendungen der Kollokationsforschung in historischer und zeitgen\u00f6ssischer\nPerspektive umrissen, darauf folgt eine Abhandlung \u00fcber Kollokationen im\nSprachenvergleich (Englisch-Deutsch). Danach werden die Grundlagen der\nzweisprachigen Lexikographie erl\u00e4utert, bevor im Hauptteil der Arbeit auf die\nverschiedenen Methoden zur Erstellung eines Englisch-Deutschen Adjektiv-Nomen-\nKollokationsw\u00f6rterbuchs n\u00e4her eingegangen wird. Abschlie\u00dfend wird die\nAnwendbarkeit eines solchen W\u00f6rterbuchs diskutiert und dessen Erweiterung auf\nandere Kollokationsstrukturen besprochen.\nPhilippa Maurer-StrohPREFACE\nI occasionally work as a freelance translator. Whilst undertaking translation work, I\nhave put in many hours of unnecessary work trying to find the correct equivalent of a\nmulti-word unit. Having checked various bilingual and general monolingual dictionaries\nas well as monolingual collocation dictionaries and being finally convinced that my\nchoice of a word combination is perfectly fine, it may nevertheless seem odd to a native\nspeaker. Having a degree in English Studies and making extensive use of existing\ndictionaries is obviously not enough to know which words go together...\nAccordingly, the aim of my thesis is to present an appropriate method of compiling a\nbilingual dictionary specialised on collocations.\nLanguage cannot be invented; it can only be captured.\n(John McH. Sinclair)11\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nI have been riveted on dictionaries and phrases ever since I was first introduced to\ndictionaries by a former English teacher of mine, way back in 1988, and I would like to\nthank my two supervisors, Univ. Prof. Allan James and Univ. Prof. Dusan Gabrovsek\nfor greatly encouraging me with their support to engage in lexicography and\nphraseology - and, naturally, for supervising this doctoral thesis.\nI would like to sincerely thank Professor James not only for introducing me to\nlinguistics in general but also for finding me the best possible second supervisor ever.\nApart from being my most valuable academic source concerning dictionaries and\nphraseology (and linguistics in general), Professor Gabrovsek is even more enthusiastic\nabout dictionaries and phrases than I am - and if we had been able to do so, we would\nhave spent (more) hours (in bookstores) indulging in \"dictionariesms\" and\n\"collcoations\". LEXICOGRAPHY & PHRASEOLOGY GALORE - as Prof.\nGabrovsek would say. I am deeply grateful to him for being there for me (in person, e-\nmail, phone and MS Messenger) whenever problems occurred or there was a danger of\n\"losing track\". Also, I would like to thank him for helpful hints on and making available\nto me most of the literature on my topic. Finally, Prof. Gabrovsek provided me with the\nmental support I needed and without which I would never have finished this thesis.\nThank you from the bottom of my heart!\nRight after my graduation, Professor James made me aware of a number of relevant\ncourses, workshops and other events to participate in. Without these hints I would not\nhave been able to gain from the expertise of John Sinclair, Elena Tognini-Bonelli,\nGoran Kjellmer, Patrick Hanks, Sue Atkins, Adam Kilgarriff, Mike Rundell, Perailla\nDanielsson and Frank M\u00fcller.\nAt this point I wish to express my sincere gratitude to the STUDIENREKTORAT at the\nUniversity of Klagenfurt. It was their grant that made my participation in these courses\npossible. Additionally, I was able to use the grant for my journeys to Germany\n(Professor Michael Stubbs in Trier) and Britain (Professor Wolfgang Teubert in\nBirmingham).m\nI would like to thank Mike Stubbs for initiating me into corpus linguistics, for\nsupporting me with advice and for inviting me to Trier to get to know the university and\nfor hands-on sessions on various computer programs.\nProf. Teubert is a valuable contact as regards (contrastive) corpus linguistics and\nphraseology; he has ever since supported me wholeheartedly and I wish to personally\nthank him for that.\nFurthermore, I would like to thank Ao. Univ. Prof. G\u00fcnther Fliedl for his support. His\nenthusiasm and readiness to help were a driving force in setting up a project of\ninternational dimensions from a \"small\" computer program. Especially, I am deeply\ngrateful to my brother Sebastian. He was the one who wrote that initial program - and\nset the ball rolling. Also, I wish to express my thanks to Ingrid Fernandez de Retana,\nAndreas Homa, Werner S\u00fchs and Georg Weber, all members of the team.\nWith sadness, I wish to acknowledge the support of one of my deceased teachers, Ao.\nUniv. Prof. Hans K\u00f6berl. His translation courses were intriguing and illuminating. I\nwish I could have learned more from him concerning contrastive phraseology.\nResearchers and professionals from other institutions also helped me gain better\nunderstanding of the subject or introduced me to specialist colleagues: Philipp Koehn,\nCambridge (MA); Ann Lawson, Oxford University Press; Oliver Mason, Birmingham\nUniversity; Matthias Richter, Leipzig University; Olaf Thyen, Duden-Redaktion,\nMannheim.\nI would like to thank all my close friends - Michael Dabringer, Ingrid Fernandez de\nRetana, Karolin Knoch, Daniel Koban, Philipp Loebell, Lotte Maurer, Nikolaus\nNeubauer, Philipp Nicolelli-Fulgenzi, Johannes Pagitz and Ursula Zager, in particular -\nfor their support and help.\nFinally, in the most private sphere of acknowledgements, Mum, Dad, Johnny, Basti and\nFernanda, you are the best. Thank you for making all this possible! We all know that the\nsituation is not easy, but together we can handle more than that!IV\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreface i\nAcknowledgements ii\nAbbreviations vii\nList of Figures ix\nList of Tables xii\n1.

Introduction\nWhen people from non-linguistic backgrounds ask me about the subject of my research\nand I tell them that I compile a bilingual dictionary of adjective-noun collocations, it is\nnothing unusual for me to get puzzled looks - what is a collocation? In a nutshell, I will\nsay, a collocation can be defined as a typical co-occurrence of words. However, even\nthis straightforward definition usually does not mean a thing to my conversation\npartners. Only when I illustrate the term collocation by using M.A.K. Halliday's (1966:\n150) famous example and make them aware of the fact that the German adjective-noun\ncombination starker Tee should be rendered into English as strong tea rather than\npowerful tea - although both powerful and strong are translation equivalents of the\nGerman stark - will they realise what I mean by the term collocation. Typically, they\nwill agree that a bilingual collocation dictionary is a useful tool to enhance their skills in\na foreign language.\n1.1. An Adjective-Noun Collocation Dictionary\nFor lexicographical purposes in particular, collocations are normally divided into two\ncategories: grammatical and lexical collocations (Benson et al. 1997: ix).\nGrammatical collocations consist of a dominant (content) word, i.e. an adjective, a noun\nor a verb, and a preposition or a grammatical construction such as a clause or an\ninfinitive. Grammatical collocations are, for example, (to be) attracted to, (it is)\ndelightful + to + infinitive, (to have) an interest in (something), (it is) a myth that +\nclause and to vote against (someone/something).Lexical collocations, on the other hand, consist of two content words and typically\nreveal the following structures:\n(1) adjective + noun addled eggs, blithering idiot, heavy smoker, sheer folly\n(2) noun + verb (a) disaster strikes, negotiations collapse, prices fall\n(3) verb + noun you commit a crime, you give a lecture, you impose taxes\n(4) verb + adverb you deeply meditate, you defend something vigorously\n(5) adverb + adjective readily available, perfectly capable, utterly absorbed\nIn English, nouns are often used attributively, i.e. pre-modifying another noun, and can\nthus be treated as adjectives, e.g. book review and cough remedy.\nGiven the fact that up to 80% of the words in discourse (spoken and written) are chosen\naccording to the co-selection principle rather than to purely syntagmatic and\ngrammatical factors (Sinclair 2000: 197), and that adjective-noun collocations are\namong the most common realisations of this lexical co-selection principle, the main\nfocus of this thesis is on the analysis of adjective-noun combinations and combinations\nof attributively used nouns premodifiying other nouns within the wider framework of\nphraseology, in order to develop a methodology for the compilation of a specialised\ncollocation dictionary.\n1.2. A Bilingual Adjective-Noun Collocation Dictionary\nIn both the relevant literature and lexicographical practice, the concept of collocation is\nstill obscured by its numerous interpretations and varying terminology. The English\nlanguage alone has more than 50 terms that can, in the broadest sense, be defined as\n'typical co-occurrence of words' (cf. Wray and Perkins 2000: 3 and Cowie 1988: 7). I\nwill give a brief overview of these in chapter 2 and delimit how I see collocations in the\nlight of my specialised bilingual collocation dictionary.\nWith regard to this 'babel' it is, indeed, difficult to fulfil the expectations of each\n'school of collocation' when writing a collocation dictionary, whether adjective-noun orgeneral, and this is certainly epitomised in the compilation of a bilingual collocation\ndictionary, specialised or not.\nFirst of all, what kind of information will the user of a bilingual collocation dictionary\nof adjective-noun collocations expect to retrieve?\nTo begin with, many collocations are language-specific and, consequently, collocational\npatterns are different across language pairs. Even languages as closely related as\nEnglish and German reveal considerable semantic and structural differences in their\nadjective-noun collocational patterning, as Fig. 1 clearly shows.\nEnglish\nred-hot / odds-on favourite\nheavy smoker\n(the patient is) in a critical condition\nto be employed as a teacher of French\non a part-time basisGerman\nhaushoher Favorit\n(lit. trans, house-high favourite)\nstarker Raucher\n(lit. trans, strong smoker)\nder Zustand des Patienten ist kritisch\n(lit. trans, the condition of... is critical)\nder Patient schwebt in Lebensgefahr\n(lit. trans, the ... floats in danger of his life)\nals Teilzeitlehrer(in) f\u00fcr Franz\u00f6sisch\nangestellt sein\n(lit. trans, angestellt sein als Lehrer(in) f\u00fcr\nFranz\u00f6sisch auf Teilzeit-Basis)\nFig. 1 : Semantic and structural differences between English and German adjective-noun collocations\nSecond, in the contrastive framework, collocations have to be looked at from two\ndifferent angles, i.e. decoding and encoding. Decoding a collocation means to\ncomprehend a foreign-language (hereafter L2) collocation or translate it into one's\nnative language (henceforth LI). Encoding a collocation means to produce an L2\ncollocation or to translate an LI collocation into an L2.Generally speaking, collocations do not cause many problems in the decoding process,\nas long as the two words that make up the collocation are known to the speaker or\nwriter. The encoding process, however, can cause a lot of difficulties since speakers, in\ndealing with collocations, tend to rely on the hypothesis of transferability (Bahns 1993:\n61), i.e. they take the LI collocation and translate it word-by-word with the translation\nequivalents that spring to their minds most readily. The errors, consequently, are due to\nLI interference. And it is particularly at the post-intermediate and advanced levels of\nlearning a foreign language, i.e. the stages when the learners start creative writing, that\nthese weaknesses come to the fore.\nCollocations are passwords to native-like fluency in a foreign language (Cop 1991:\n2776), and although an erroneous collocation may be still understood by the native\nspeaker, it might cause laughter or even annoyance. Collocational errors should thus be\nminimised in translation and advanced writing in particular. This is why advanced\nlearners and translators are the main target user groups of a collocation dictionary.\nResearch has shown that, in spite of the recent developments in monolingual learners'\ndictionaries (of English in particular), translators and learners still consult their bilingual\ndictionaries first before turning to the monolingual ones (for reassurance or because\nthey were not able to find the information they needed in the bilingual dictionary). This\nand the fact that there are only few collocation dictionaries available in any language,\nmonolingual or bilingual, justify my efforts to compile a bilingual collocation\ndictionary.\nSince I am a learner of English and a native speaker of German, it would be obvious to\nmake an encoding dictionary for German learners of English; however, in the\ncompilation process, in the absence of an English native speaker, the best possible\nalternative is for me as the lexicographer to encode into my mother tongue, German,\nalthough this, but only at first sight, creates a somewhat artificial situation.\nThe result of this thesis will therefore be an adjective-noun collocation dictionary for\nthe English user encoding into German. In essence, the dictionary will be\nmonodirectional and monofunctional however, an index of German nouns in the back\nmatter of the dictionary will make it useful also for the German speaker.1.3. The Need for a Bilingual Collocation Dictionary\nAs mentioned in 1.2., users, particularly in the encoding process, still tend to first use\nbilingual dictionaries before they refer to monolingual ones. But how good are bilingual\ndictionaries when it comes to their provision of collocations?\nIn a recent paper of mine (Maurer-Stroh 2004b) I tested the four major comprehensive\nbilingual dictionaries of English and German: Duden Oxford Gro\u00dfw\u00f6rterbuch Englisch:\nDeutsch-Englisch, Englisch-Deutsch (hereafter DUOX), Collins German-English,\nEnglish-German Dictionary Unabridged (COGER), PONS W\u00f6rterbuch f\u00fcr Schule und\nStudium Englisch-Deutsch (PONS) and Langenscheidts Handw\u00f6rterbuch Englisch\n(LANGE). With the help of these dictionaries, in my case study, I tried to translate 38\nGerman adjective-noun collocations into English. The best result was achieved by using\nCOGER, though this also only helped me translate 84% of the collocations in question.\nAnother test of mine using these four bilingual dictionaries was to translate 29 English\nadjective-noun collocations into German (Maurer-Stroh 2004c). The best result was\nonly 79.3%.\nMoreover, even if the collocation is in the dictionary, this does not mean that it will be\neasy to find. Bilingual dictionaries still lack a shared policy as to where they list\nadjective-noun collocations, i.e. under the adjective or under the noun.\nLet us make an experiment. How many look-ups do the collocations a poor comparison\nand afar-fetched comparison need in DUOX, for example?\n(I) poor comparison\n(a) you will not find the collocation in the entry for comparison\n(b) the entry for poor does not explicitly list the combination either\n(c) the next best thing would be to search the German translation of comparison\nsince this noun is less polysemous than the adjective poor and, consequently, the\nentry to browse is simpler; and, indeed poor comparison can be found in the\nentry for Vergleich(2) far-fetched comparison\n(a) the collocation is nor explicitly listed in the entry for comparison\n(b) nor is it listed in the entry fox far-fetched\n(c) the entry for the German equivalent Vergleich does not contain the collocation\neither\n(d) as a next step we try to look for the collocation in the entry for the German\ntranslation equivalent of far-fetched, which is weit hergeholt; strangely, we do\nnot find an entry for weit hergeholt\n(e) we do not find the collocation in the entry for weit either\n(f) in the entry for herholen (the infinitive of hergeholt) we eventually find weit\nhergeholt and its translation equivalent far-fetched; still, the collocation is not\nexplicitly stated anywhere in the dictionary\nWhile poor comparison needs three look-ups, not even a six-step look-up process in\nDUOX gives you the German translation of far-fetched comparison.\nElectronic advances have made it possible to convert print dictionaries into machine\nreadable databases and thus create electronic dictionaries on CD-ROM, which allow for\nfull-text search in all entries. However, even in using the electronic version of DUOX,\nthe translation of poor comparison needs three look-ups for successful retrieval since\nthe full-text search lists three entries in which poor and comparison are included, not\nnecessarily as a collocation though, and maybe scattered across the whole entry.\nHowever, the search for a translation equivalent of far-fetched comparison is highly\nfacilitated with the help of the full-text search. Only one look-up is needed to find out\nthat the German translation of the adjective in far-fetched comparison is gesucht.\nHowever, the exact collocation is not listed in its translation and the user would have to\nsearch for the German translation of comparison in another, second, look-up.\nYet, also with the full-text search tool in the CD-ROM version of DUOX you would\nsearch in vain for the collocation apt comparison.\nA bilingual adjective-noun collocation dictionary would remedy this dilemma, as you\ncan see in Fig. 2.comparison\nappropriate schlagender / sehr \u00fcberzeugender Vergleich |\napt passender / treffender Vergleich | dose eingehender /\ngenauer Vergleich | detailed detaillierter / eingehender\nVergleich | direct direkter Vergleich | fair fairer / gerechter\nVergleich | far-fetched gesuchter / gek\u00fcnstelter /\nweithergeholter Vergleich | favourable vorteilhafte\nGegen\u00fcberstellung, vorteilhafter Vergleich | good guter\nVergleich | inept ungeeigneter / unangemessener /\nunpassender Vergleich | invidious ungerechter / unfairer /\nunpassender Vergleich | meaningful aussagekr\u00e4ftiger /\nsinnvoller Vergleich | simple einfacher Vergleich |\nsystematic systematischer Vergleich | unfair ungerechter /\nunfairer Vergleich | unfavourable nachteiliger Vergleich |\nuseful brauchbarer / praktischer Vergleich | valid treffender\nVergleich\n\u2022 you couldn't have made a more apt comparison man\nh\u00e4tte es nicht treffender vergleichen k\u00f6nnen;\nthis is a feeble / misleading I poor comparison der\nVergleich hinkt\nto make a point by point comparison etwas Punkt f\u00fcr\nPunkt vergleichen\ntextual comparison vergleichende Gegen\u00fcberstellung\nvon Texten\n\u2022 price comparison Preisvergleich m\ntextual comparison (TECHN) Synopse f\nFig. 2: A sample entry from an English-German adjective-noun collocation dictionary (1)\nNow one would ask oneself, could it be true that nobody else before has realised that\nthere is a need for a collocation dictionary? And, even more importantly, has this theory\nbeen put into practice?\nInterestingly enough, there are, in English, only four dictionaries available which\nexplicitly state that they are collocation dictionaries: the BBI Dictionary of English\nWord Combinations (BBI), the LTP Dictionary of Selected Collocations (LTP) the\nOxford Collocations Dictionary for Students of English (OCD) and Collins COBUILD\nCollocations on CD-ROM (COBCOLL). While the BBI and the LTP are available in\nprint format only and COBCOLL is only available as a CD-ROM, the OCD is available\nin both print and electronic formats.\nFor the German language, only one combinatory dictionary is available, though it is not\nexclusively restricted to collocations, the Duden-Das Stilw\u00f6rterbuch (DUST).8\nAs far as bilingual collocation dictionaries are concerned, this type of specialised\ndictionary is rare in any language pair anywhere in the world, as far as I am aware; what\nyou can find is a Chinese-English and a Japanese-English collocation dictionary, a\nRussian-English dictionary of verbal collocations and a Russian-English collocation\ndictionary of parts of the human body.\nFor English and German, at present, there are indeed two bilingual collocation\ndictionary available, the Advanced Readers ' Collocation Searcher (ARCS) and The\nAdvanced Learner's Trilingual Lexicon. Dictionnaire th\u00e9matique anglais-fran\u00e7ais-\nallemand. Politique-Economie-Expression du temps et de la quantification (ALTD).\nWhile ARCS is primarily an English collocation dictionary, which is only available on\nCD-ROM, that translates the English headword into German, ALTD, being a trilingual\ndictionary in the first place, offers only collocations from a highly restricted register.\nThus, the need for an English-German adjective-noun collocation dictionary is all the\nmore evident.\n1.4. What Should an English-German Adjective-Noun Collocation\nDictionary Look Like?\nThe English-German adjective-noun collocation dictionary I envisage is a dictionary\ntargeted at advanced English learners of German or English-to-German translators,\nsince these two groups can benefit the most from a dictionary of this kind. It is primarily\nin the encoding process that each of this user group can take advantage of my dictionary\nin order to produce native-like texts in their L2.\nAn encoding adjective-noun collocation dictionary for English users necessitates an\nalphabetised list of headwords that consists of English nouns rather than adjectives,\nsince it is the noun - semantically the core item - that is pre-modified by the adjective.\nIn finding a translation equivalent of a collocation, the user will, therefore, start with the\nlook-up of the noun.On the microstructural level, the entries will be separated into four different sections.\nIn the first section, the user finds English adjectives that usually collocate with the\nheadword noun and whose translation equivalents reveal the same adjective + noun\nstructure. They are, for the sake of user-friendliness, listed in alphabetical order rather\nthan by frequency.\nTogether with the translation of the respective adjectives, each German adjective is\nfollowed by the translation equivalent of the English headword. This is essential since\nsome English nouns have, depending on the preceding adjective, more than one German\ntranslation equivalent.\nThe second section is devoted to English adjective-noun collocations whose German\ntranslations are structurally incongruent, i.e. not revealing an adjective + noun structure.\nIn the third section the user finds English patterns, e.g. preposition + adjective + noun,\nthat are structurally incongruent in German.\nFinally, in the fourth section, the user is made aware of English adjective-noun\ncombinations that are German compounds, i.e. words that are orthographically written\nas a single word in German, or German simplex words.\nWith this layout the user might have to look at each of the sections to get the\ninformation they are looking for, but the division certainly makes sense with respect to\nthe complexity the entry would show if all information was given in a single\nalphabetical stretch.\nFor polysemous English headwords this four-fold division is repeated for each sense.\nSense divisions are marked by Roman numbers, and a synonym or paraphrase is given\nto find the needed sense easily .\nFig. 3 indicates what such an entry looks like.10\nbasis\nbroad breite Basis | firm feste Basis / Grundlage, stabile\nBasis | scientific wissenschaftliche Grundlage | sound solide\n/ gesunde Basis | theoretical theoretische Grundlage\n\u2022 to work on a casual basis Gelegenheitsarbeiter sein\nto have a factual basis auf Tatsachen beruhen\nto have no firm I sound basis (fig.) auf wackeligen F\u00fc\u00dfen\nstehen\nto work on a commission basis auf Provisions-/\nProzentbasis arbeiten, gegen Provision arbeiten\nto put something on a different basis etwas auf eine\nneue Grundlage stellen\nto be engaged on a part-time basis to teach French als\nTeilzeitlehrer/-in f\u00fcr Franz\u00f6sisch angestellt sein /arbeiten\nto be employed on a permanent I regular basis fest\nangestellt sein\nto do something on a professional basis etwas\n[hauptberuflich machen / betreiben\nto approach a problem on a scientific basis an ein\nProblem wissenschaftlich herangehen\nto put a procedure on a scientific basis ein Verfahren\nverwissenschaftlichen\nto meet with someone on a social basis mit jemandem\nau\u00dferdienstlich verkehren\nto be on a sound basis (business) auf feste F\u00fc\u00dfen stehen,\n{theory) auf einer soliden Basis ruhen\nto help out on a temporary basis als Aushilfe arbeiten\nto be employed on a trial basis auf Probe, probehalber/,-\nweise besch\u00e4ftigt sein\nHow does it average out on a weekly basis?

Monolingual Collocation Dictionaries vs. Bilingual Collocation\nDictionaries\nAs can be seen in Fig. 3, the third section of my entry for basis in the English-German\nadjective-noun collocation dictionary reveals a certain pattern, i.e. on a ... basis.\nHowever, looking at the German translations, you find that this pattern is not repeated.\nPatterns, as it were, blur the traditional distinction between grammar and lexis as two\ndifferent axes of language description, the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic axes\n(Sinclair 2000: 194-96). It is often the case, as with on a ... basis, for example, that \"a\nparticular grammatical or lexical choice correlates with one meaning of a word rather\nthan another\" (Sinclair 1991: 6).\nIn a monolingual collocation dictionary there will surely be a distinction between the\nsenses of basis as 'that from which something can be / is developed' and 'the way in\nwhich something is organised / done'; however, the on a ... basis pattern will not be\ntreated exhaustively in a monolingual collocation dictionary since it is of little interest\nto list all the adjectives that are possible lexical choices in this pattern and the 'etc.\ndevice' may have a useful role to play.\nIn the bilingual framework, on the other hand, the repeated English pattern is of high\nsignificance since the German side reveals different translation equivalents for almost\nall instances for on a ... basis (cf. Fig. 3). Even within the separate sections of the entry\ndifferent translations can be found:\nEnglish German\nto approach a problem on a scientific basis an ein Problem wissenschaftlich\nherangehen\nto put a procedure on a scientific basis ein Verfahren verwissenschaftlichen\non a weekly basis ein Mal in der Woche, w\u00f6chentlich\nHow does it average out on a weekly basis? Wie viel ist das im Schnitt pro Woche?\nFig. 4: Examples of the English on a ... basis pattern and its German translation equivalents12\nWhat we learn from this observation is that one cannot simply translate a monolingual\ncollocation dictionary in order to get a useful bilingual one, an argument which is\nfurther enhanced when you compare the entries for comparison in Fig. 5a to 5d:\ncomparison\nappropriate schlagender / sehr \u00fcberzeugender Vergleich |\napt passender / treffender Vergleich | close eingehender /\ngenauer Vergleich | detailed detaillierter / eingehender\nVergleich | direct direkter Vergleich | fair fairer / gerechter\nVergleich | far-fetched gesuchter / gek\u00fcnstelter /\nweithergeholter Vergleich | favourable vorteilhafte\nGegen\u00fcberstellung, vorteilhafter Vergleich | good guter\nVergleich | inept ungeeigneter / unangemessener,\nunpassender Vergleich | invidious ungerechter / unfairer /\nunpassender Vergleich | meaningful aussagekr\u00e4ftiger /\nsinnvoller Vergleich | simple einfacher Vergleich |\nsystematic systematischer Vergleich | unfair ungerechter /\nunfairer Vergleich | unfavourable nachteiliger Vergleich |\nuseful brauchbarer / praktischer Vergleich | valid treffender\nVergleich\n\u2022 you couldn't have made a more apt comparison man\nh\u00e4tte es nicht treffender vergleichen k\u00f6nnen;\nthis is a feeble I misleading I poor comparison der\nVergleich hinkt\nto make a point by point comparison etwas Punkt f\u00fcr\nPunkt vergleichen\ntextual comparison vergleichende Gegen\u00fcberstellung\nvon Texten\n\u2022 price comparison Preisvergleich m\ntextual comparison (TECHN) Synopse f\nFig. 5a: The entry for comparison in the English-German adjective-noun collocation dictionary\nComparison Vergleich m\nfavourable vorteilhaft, unfavourable\nunvorteilhaft | broad grob, crude primitiv,\nsimple einfach | close genau, detailed\ndetailliert, direct direkt | fair gerecht, good\ngut, meaningful sinnvoll, useful, n\u00fctzlich,\nvalid g\u00fcltig | unfair ungerecht\nFig. 5b: The entry for comparison\ntranslated from OCDComparison Vergleich m\nclose genau, unfair ungerecht, fair\ngerecht, far-reaching weit reichend,\nunfavourable unvorteilhaft, favourable\nvortheilhaft, instructive aufschlussreich,\ninvidious ungerecht, true wahrheitsgetreu,\nunwelcome unangenehm\nFig. 5c: The entry for comparison\ntranslated from LTP\ncomparison\na favourable - ein vorteilhafter Vergleich;\nan unfavourable ~ ein unvorteilhafter\nVergleich\nFig. 5c: The entry for comparison translated from BBI13\n1.6. Outline of the Chapters\nChapter 2 starts with an overview of where the concept of collocation is to be placed\nwithin the wider framework of contemporary mainstream phraseology. In the\nsubsequent sections I outline the different approaches and interpretations as seen from\nthe historical angle, discussing the major research areas and the work done by the\npractitioners in the field of collocation studies. Particularly, I deal with corpus\nlinguistics and its merits for collocation research, sketching out the contributions of\ncomputational linguistics.\nChapter 3 is devoted to collocations as seen in the contrastive light. I provide a model of\nclassification of English and German adjective-noun collocations and demonstrate in a\ncase study that the contrastive story does not end with bilingual dictionaries but has a\nmuch greater impact with regard to the numerous online translation tools which are\navailable free of charge.\nIn Chapter 4 my main focus is on the lexicographical theory and practice with special\nreference to collocational considerations. I start by discussing existing collocation\ndictionaries, monolingual and bilingual, and continue with an outline of bilingual\nlexicography in general. Further to these theoretical issues, I deal with collocations as\npresented in modern bilingual dictionaries. In the closing section of Chapter 4 users'\nneeds are examined closely in order to lay the foundation for Chapter 5 - compilation\nmethods.\nChapter 5 first outlines two different methodologies in present-day (bilingual)\nlexicography and continues with the exemplification and comparison of these\napproaches.\nIn Chapter 6,1 demonstrate that widening the scope of my research is indeed realistic in\nterms of both lexicographical and computational perspectives.14\n2. Collocation: Concepts, Sources and Methods\nAs pointed out already in the introduction (section 1.2.), there is no general consensus\non what the term collocation stands for in phraseology, nor is there any universal\nclassification in the relevant literature and practice to be found. What all theories do\nhave in common, however, is that collocations are primarily syntagmatic relations the\nslots of which are not filled by grammar rules alone1.\nUsing grammaticality as the only constraint in language production is what Sinclair put\nforward as the 'open-choice' principle (1991: 109). Yet, since words do not necessarily\noccur at random in a text \"the open-choice principle does not provide for substantial\nenough restraints on consecutive choices [and] we would not produce normal text\nsimply by operating the open-choice principle.\" (ibid: 110).\nAs a consequence, Sinclair proposed what he called the 'idiom' principle, i.e. that a\nlanguage user has available to him or her a large number of semi-preconstructed phrases\nthat constitute single choices.\" (ibid.)\nThe term 'idiom' principle is somewhat misleading in the wider framework of\nphraseology - as we will see later in this chapter - and Sinclair himself re-named the\nprinciple of the choice of words being affected by the choice of others in their vicinity\n(ibid: 173) to 'co-selection' principle (Sinclair 2000: 197).\nIn fact, this dichotomy expressing the two tendencies, the terminological and the\nphraseological tendency of language patterning (Sinclair 2004: 29), was observed\nalready by Otto Jespersen in 1924 (Clas 1999:1) and Harold E. Palmer in 1933 (Cowie\n1999: 132)2 - although in different frameworks.\n1 In a way, one could say that collocations combine what Saussure (1916) has so cleverly separated into\nsyntagmatic and associative (paradigmatic) relations.\n2 Note that by the time of their observations they where geographically wide apart - Jespersen was in\nEurope while Palmer taught in Asia.15\nClearly, collocation is a concept which works on the level of co-selection, but this\nprinciple covers much more than that. What can also be subsumed under the\nsuperordinate co-selection are proverbs, clich\u00e9s, idioms, compounds - just to mention a\nfew examples.\nOne of the reasons why collocations are defined and looked at in a variety of ways is\nthat it is notoriously difficult to classify them as a category in phraseology. Generally,\nthey are defined according to the research area or practical purpose for which they are\nof immediate concern. Thus, a computational linguist will define collocation in a\ndifferent way than a translatologist or a lexicographer.\n2.1. Different Approaches, Interpretations and Applications of the\nConcept of Collocation\nHistorically speaking, H.E. Palmer is said to have been the first to actually use the term\n'collocation' in its modern linguistic sense in his report to the IRET (Institute for\nResearch in English Teaching) Convention of 1927 in Tokyo (Cowie 1999: 53)3.\nYet, the father of phraseology in general is said to have been the Swiss structuralist\nCharles Bally4 who distinguishes between locutions phras\u00e9ologiques (phraseological\nunits in the broadest sense) and unit\u00e9s phras\u00e9ologiques (idioms in the strictest sense)\n(cf. Bally 1909, as quoted in Hecken 2004).\nIn principle, there are six major lines of 'collocational thinking': the pedagogical, the\nlexicographical, the early (Russian) phraseological, the (contemporary) phraseological,\nthe linguistic (frequency-based) and the computational approaches. In practice,\nhowever, these approaches are all interrelated. In the following, I will outline the\ndifferent approaches and identify the people most prominently associated with them.\n3 The OED states 1750 HARRIS Hermes II. iv. Wks. (1841) 197 as the first mention of collocation in the\nsense of 'arrangement of words in a sentence', while collocation as a technical linguistic term was,\naccording to the OED, introduced by J.R. Firth in 1951.\n4 He was a pupil of Ferdinand de Saussure.16\n2.2.1. The Pedagogical Approach to Collocations\nHarold E. Palmer's interest in collocations was primarily a pedagogical one since he\nwas a teacher of English in Japan.\n\"It is not so much the words of English nor the grammar of English that makes English\ndifficult, but that that vague and undefined obstacle to progress in the learning of English\nconsists for the most part in the existence of so many odd comings-together-of-words.\"\n(H.E. Palmer 1933: 13)\nThus, Palmer was fully aware of the need for a classification of these 'comings-\ntogether-of-words', and he defined collocation as \"a succession of two or more words\nthat may best be learned as if it were a single word.\" (Palmer 1938: x; cf. Cowie 1999:\n54).\nAlthough Palmer and his assistant and eventual successor A.S. Hornby used the term\ncollocation for the whole spectrum of word combinations, their work laid the\nfoundations for the treatment of collocations and idioms by later generations of\nphraseologists, both theorists and lexicographers5.\n2.2.2. The Russian Phraseological Approach to Collocations\nIn Russia, linguists were strongly influenced by the work of Charles Bally (cf. section\n2.1.), and it was in the time from the 1940s to the 1960s that phraseology started to\ndevelop there into a discipline in its own right (cf. Hecken 2004; Skandera 2004).\n5 Palmer and Hornby's awareness of collocations (in the broadest sense) was a result of their work on a\ncontrolled English vocabulary. The vocabulary control movement started in the late 1920s and arose from\nthe pedagogical need to reduce the vocabulary for foreign learners of English to a manageable core -\nwhich the results of Palmer's earlier studies had shown to be 1,000 words as the required minimum in\norder to still be able to achieve naturalness. While Palmer, Hornby and Michael West (who joined them in\nthe late 1930s) used personal judgment on the basis of their teaching experience to compile such a word\nlist, the American linguist Edward L. Thorndike went for an objective-quantitative method in which he\ncounted the most frequent words in a body of written text of four million words (Cowie 1999: 14-17).17\nRussian phraseologists, with V.V. Vinogradov and N.N. Amosova as their prime\nfigures, saw phraseological units as different realisations on a phraseological\ncontinuum. Different degrees of opacity of the combinations were the key for they\nattempt to reach a classification of all phraseological units.\nOn the primary level of the Russian phraseologists' classification, sentence-like (or\npragmatic) units were distinguished from word-like (or semantic) units. For the purpose\nof this thesis I will only deal with word-like units since adjective-noun combinations\nfall in this category.\nWord-like units were classified along a cline of semantic motivation: (1) semantically\nopaque units, (2) partially motivated units and (3) phraseologically bound units - where\ncollocations fall under the third category (Cowie 1998a: 4-7).\n2.2.3. The Phraseological Approach to Collocations\nThe phraseological approach to collocations has been strongly influenced by the\nRussian tradition in as much as it is an attempt to categorise all phraseological units\nalong a cline of varying degrees of opacity (cf. Skandera 2004: 28).\n(1) A. P. Cowie\nCowie takes this a step further, and categorises phraseological units not only on the\nbasis of their semantic transparency, but also according to their grade of lexical and\ngrammatical variability (cf. Nesselhauf 2004: 10).\nFirst of all, Cowie (1994) distinguishes 'composites' from 'formulae' - a categorisation\nwhich goes hand in hand with the Russian tradition - the former being word\ncombinations below the sentence level. According to semantic transparency and (lexical\nand grammatical) variability composites are further classified into the following\ncategories which should be seen on a scale from (1) to (4):18\na) pure idioms - they are completely opaque and invariable, e.g. red tape\nb) figurative idioms - they are slightly variable and have one figurative and one\nliteral interpretation, e.g. green fingers\nc) restricted collocations - they have one figurative and one literal element and there\nis an arbitrary combinability restriction on one of the elements with other elements\noutside the combination, e.g. dry cow\nd) open collocations - they consist of elements which are both used in their literal\nsense and they are freely combinable, e.g. thunderous applause.\n(2) I.A. Mel'cuk\nFollowing the Russian classification model, Mel'cuk also distinguishes between\nsentence- and word-like units.\nHe refers to word-like units as semantic phrasemes (as opposed to pragmatic\nphrasemes) and subdivides them as follows (cf. Nesselhauf 2004: 12; Skandera 2004:\n29):\na) idioms - their meaning as a whole is not included in any of the constituents, e.g.\nred tape\nb) quasi-idioms / quasi-phrasemes - they have a literal meaning and implicitly\nexpress an additional one, e.g. bacon and eggs - where the meaning of 'fried' is\npart of either element (Nesselhauf 2004: 12)\nc) collocations / semi-phrasemes\nMel'cuk further classifies collocation in four major categories, which Nesselhauf (2004:\n12) summarises in a less formalised language as (1) collocations including a delexical\nverb, e.g. take a step, (2) collocations in which the meaning of the dependent lexeme is\nexpressed in combination with only a few others, e.g. black ('without milk') coffee, (3)\ncollocations whose dependent lexeme can be used in the same sense in combination\nwith a lot of other lexemes, e.g. strong coffee, and (4) collocations in which the19\ndependent lexeme includes the meaning of the other lexeme, e.g. the meaning 'horse' is\nincluded in neigh6.\nWhat Mel'cuk is best known for is his model of 'lexical functions' (LFs), which is part\nof his 'Meaning-Text-Theory' and comprises well over 50 different types. He sees\ncollocations as an oriented relationship where the so-called 'keyword' selects the\ndependent lexeme, the 'value', i.e. in a combination like heavy smoker, smoker is the\nkeyword and selects the value heavy through the lexical function of Magn ('magnitude'\n= intensifier)7.\n2.2.4. The Lexicographical Approach to Collocations\nThe lexicographical approach deals with the question of how collocations should be\npresented in dictionaries. The prime practitioners are Morton Benson and Franz-Josef\nHausmann, although also A.P. Cowie, I.A. Mel'cuk and H.E. Palmer must be\nmentioned here.\nCowie implemented his phraseological approach in the two volumes of the Oxford\nDictionary of Current Idiomatic English (1975 and 1983), Mel'cuk compiled the\nDictionnaire explicatif et combinatoire du fran\u00e7ais contemporain: recherches lexico-\ns\u00e9mantiques (1984-99), so far in four volumes and, together with A.K. Zholkovsky, the\nExplanatory Combinatorial Dictionary of Modern Russian (1984) using his model of\n6 This conception of the term collocation can be compared to W. Porzig's \"Wesenhafte\nBedeutungsbeziehungen\" (1934) - this is basically an approach to meaning concerned with syntagmatic\nrelations, e.g. wiehern - Pferd (viz. neigh - horse) where the semantic relevance of the syntactic relation\nis obvious since what can be connected with wiehern is implicit in it: \"Es handelt sich dabei [...] um eine\nbeziehung, die im wesen der gemeinten Bedeutungen selbst gr\u00fcndet. Ich nenne sie deshalb wesenhafte\nBedeutungsbeziehungen.\" (Porzig, 1934 as quoted in Banns 1996: 3).\n7 Anecdotally, Mel'cuk invented his concept of \"lexical functions to label systematic and re-current\nlexical-semantic relations\" during a storm in the Russian countryside, when reflecting on the English\nlanguage: the fact that \"rain combines with heavy while light combines with bright led him to invent the\nfirst lexical function which he called Magn (from Magnitude) to refer to an intensifying meaning.\" (cf.\nEvens 1998: 11, as quoted in Fontenelle 1997: 5)20\nLFs8 and Palmer took his work on the core vocabulary of English as the basis for his\ndictionary A Grammar of English Words (1938).\n(\\)M. Benson\nBenson, being an American Slavonic linguist, is also influenced by the Russian tradition\nin way that he defines collocations with respect to other word combinations. His\napproach to the presentation of collocations in a dictionary mainly had its basis in\npractical reasons for the purpose of compiling, together with E. Benson and R. Ilson, the\nBBI9.\nAs summarised in Nesselhauf (2004: 14-15), he divides lexical combinations (word-like\nunits in the Russian tradition) into the following categories:\na) idioms - they are defined as \"relatively frozen expressions whose meanings do not\nreflect the meanings of their component parts\" (Benson et al. 1986a: 252)\nb) transitional combinations - are more transparent than idioms but less variable than\ncollocations\nc) collocations\nd) compounds\nCollocations, for Benson, are \"recurrent, semi-fixed combinations\" and they can be\nfurther subdivided into grammatical and lexical collocations (Benson et al. 1997: ix; cf.\nsection 1.1.).\n8 The four volumes (172, 332, 323 and 347 pp.) cover only a selection of some 500 entries scattered\nthroughout the alphabet, of varying complexity (Gabrovsek 2004: E-mail communication). A full\nimplementation of Mel'\u00f6uk's LFs is A Russian-English Collocational Dictionary of the Human Body\ncompiled by Lidija Iordanskaja and Slava Papemo edited by Richard L. Leed, 1996.

Hausmann\nHausmann, first of all, distinguishes fixed from non-fixed combinations. Fixed\ncombinations, for him, are idioms, compounds, etc., while non-fixed combinations can\nbe further classified as (Hausmann 1984, as quoted in Nesselhauf 2004: 16 and Bahns\n1996: 23):\na) co-creations - are free combinations that are creatively combined by the speaker,\ne.g. une maison agr\u00e9able (viz. a pleasant home)\nb) collocations - are not creatively combined but put together out of some\nconvention, e.g. ton p\u00e9remptoire (viz. peremptory tone)\nc) counter-creations - are words that do not usually combine, they are mainly found\nin literature and advertisements to create a special effect, e.g. jour fissur\u00e9 (viz.\ncracking day).\nA collocation, according to Hausmann, can be defined as:\n\"la combinaison caract\u00e9ristique de deux mots dans une des structures suivantes: a)\nsubstantif + adjective (\u00e9pith\u00e8te) b) substantif + verbe c) verbe + substantif (objet) d) verbe +\nadverbe e) adjective + adverbe f) substantif + (pr\u00e9p.) + substantif.\"\n(F.J. Hausmann 1989: 1010)\nAccording to Nesselhauf (2004: 16-17), Hausmann's most important contribution to\ncollocation theory is his view what the status of the two elements in the collocation is\nnot the same. While one of the elements, the 'base', is semantically autonomous, the\nother one, the 'collocator' is chosen according to this base and only get its precise\nmeaning from that combination10 (cf. Hausmann 1989: 1010).\nLexicographically speaking, he put forward that collocations should be listed under\ntheir bases rather than their collocators, since \"la fameuse recherch\u00e9 du mot propre est\ncelle du collocatif.\" (Hausmann 1989: 1010). He is of the opinion that listing the\ncollocation in the collocator entry merely serves the testing of a hypothesis (\"Can I say\nThis phenomenon is referred to as 'semantic tailoring' by DJ. Allerton (1982 and 1984).22\nthis?\"), but listing the collocation in the base entry allows the dictionary user to hit upon\nan unknown collocation or a collocation they might have forgotten (ibid.).\n2.2.5. The Linguistic (Frequency-Based) Approach to Collocations\nIn contrast to the Russian, the phraseological and the lexicographical approaches, the\nlinguistic approach does not characterise collocations with respect to other word\ncombinations on a certain cline. Collocations in the linguistic approach are mainly seen\nin terms of frequency and not so much in terms of semantics.\n(1) J.R. Firth\nFirth was the first to establish the expression collocation as a technical linguistic term:\n\"I propose to bring forward as a technical term, meaning by 'collocation'\" (Firth 1951:\n194)11.\nThe concept of collocation in Firthian terms developed in connection with his 'Theory\nof Meaning'12, where he explains that \"meaning by collocation is an abstraction at the\nsyntagmatic level and it is not directly concerned with the conceptual or idea approach\nto the meaning of words [nor is it the same thing as contextual meaning]. One of the\nmeanings of night is its collocability with dark, and of dark, of course, collocation with\nnight.\" (Firth 1957b: 196).\nHowever, Firth never clearly defines the term collocation (Lyons 1977: 612). As\nNesselhauf (2004: 2-5) observes, he generally uses four different concepts. Collocations\n11 It may well be that Firth actually adopted the term from H.E. Palmer (Nesselhauf 2004: 2 and Mitchell\n1975b: 134) - who decided to employ 'collocation' as the term for his most inclusive category of\n'comings-together-of-words' since it had, in contrast to 'idiom', no settled status as a generic term in\n1927 (although the sense 'arrangements of words in a sentence' dates back to 1750). (cf. footnote 3 and\nCowie 1999: 54).\n12 Firth distinguished three levels of meaning: \"meaning by collocation\", the \"conceptual or idea approach\nto the meaning of words\" and \"contextual meaning\".23\nare thus either (1) co-occurrences of words in general (frequent or rare)13, (2) habitual\n(= frequent) co-occurrences of words, (3) a number of consecutive words or (4) an order\nof 'mutual expectancy'.\nButler (1985: 7, as quoted in Banns 1996), on the other hand, believes that Firth sees\ncollocations exclusively as habitual co-occurrences of mutually predicting lexical items\nsuch as dark + night and silly + ass.\n(2) M.A.K. Hallidav\nHalliday was one of the first to build on Firth's concept of collocation. He considers as\ncollocations syntagmatic associations of lexical items of all probabilities which occur in\na certain distance from each other.\nHe defines 'probability' as \"the frequency of the item in a stated environment relative to\nits total frequency of occurrence.\" (Halliday 1966: 156 and Nesselhauf 2004: 4), but he\ndoes not clearly define 'distance.'\nLike Firth, he sees collocation as a lexical phenomenon rather than a grammatical one -\nalthough he revised this conception later on, stating that\n\"it is essential also to examine collocational patterns in their grammatical environments, and\nto compare the descriptions given by the two methods, lexical and lexicogrammatical. This\nthen avoids prejudging the answer to the question whether or not, and if so to what extent,\nthe notion of 'lexicalness', as distinct from 'lexicogrammaticalness', is a meaningful one.\"\n(M.A.K. Halliday, 1966: 159).\n(3) T.F. Mitchell\nMitchell was a dedicated Firthian in as much as he saw 'habitualness' as the basis for\nhis concept of collocations, but he also emphasised the necessity of studying\ncollocations in their grammatical structure (Nesselhauf 2004: 6).\n13 Firth was analysing co-occurrence frequencies in letters dating from the 18th and 19th century and he\ncalled frequent co-occurrences, inter alia, 'usual' or 'habitual' collocations, while he called rare co-\noccurrences 'personal' or 'idiosyncratic' collocations.24\nHe exemplifies this with the following example: While it is possible to say heavy\ndamage, to damage heavily and heavily damaged, it is incorrect to say *heavy damager\nor *heavy damaging (Mitchell 1966: 337).\nFurthermore, Mitchell was the first in the Firthian tradition \"to attempt to draw a line\nbetween collocations and compounds and between collocations and idioms\"\n(Nesselhauf 2004: 6). His concept can, therefore, be related to the phraseological and\nthe lexicographical approaches.\nLikewise, also Benson's lexicographical-phraseological approach can be correlated with\nthe Firthian frequency-based approach, since Benson sees collocations as 'recurrent\ncombinations' (cf. section 2.2.4.).\n2.2.6. The Computational Approach to Collocations\nThe computational approach to collocations is, in essence, a continuation of the\nfrequency-based methodology in collocation studies.\nThe most prominent figure in the computational approach is John McH. Sinclair. He is,\nprincipally, a follower of Firth's tradition and his (early) work was strongly influenced\nby Halliday, Mitchell and Mclntosh.\nApart from his computational efforts, Sinclair has, more than any other Firthian linguist,\nbeen \"concerned with finding solutions to the practical problems that a Firthian view of\ncollocation poses for analysis.\" (Nesselhauf 2004: 8).\nHe helped disentangling the confusing definitions of collocations as being combinations\nof words (Firth), lexical items (Halliday) or roots (Mitchell) by putting forward that a\ncollocation is a relationship between 'words', by which 'lemmas' are meant (cf.\nSinclair 1991: 173). Lemmas are composite sets of word-forms, as are lexical items and25\nroots in Mitchell's terms, e.g. sings, singing, sing and sang can be summarised as the\nlemma SING14.\nSinclair consolidated the use of a special technical terminology in collocation research:\nThe node is the word under study, the collocate is the word that enters into collocation\nwith it and the span is the distance between the words. The set of all the collocates that\ncan enter in collocation with the node is called (collocational) range of that particular\nword15.\nAbove all, Sinclair was well aware of the fact that with the help of computers,\nfrequency counts in collocation studies could be highly facilitated since, in his approach\nto the study of lexis, he saw \"problems which are not likely to yield to anything less\nimposing than a very large computer.\" (Sinclair 1966: 410, cf. Banns 1966).\nSinclair, together with S. Jones, first used a computer in the analysis of a text\ncomprising 150,000 words. The results showed that 95% of the collocational influence\nof the node takes place within a span of four words to its left and to its right. (Jones and\nSinclair 1974: 21, as quoted in Nesselhauf 2004: 8). Thus, a good move was made\ntowards solving Halliday's problem with 'distance'.\nBeing a Firthian, Sinclair also distinguished between frequent and rare collocations,\n'significant' and 'casual', in his terms (cf. Nesselhauf 2004: 8). With the help of the\ncomputer and statistical calculations also this distinction can be sharpened - where the\nthreshold is to be set, however, remains a subjective matter.\nIn accordance with the phraseological approach, Sinclair is conscious of the fact that\ncollocations and idioms may be structurally the same, but differ in their semantics. He\neven points out that \"the line between them is not clear\" (Sinclair 1991: 172) - an\naspect which will be looked at in more detail in the subsequent section.\n14 It is a convention in linguistics to write lemmas in upper-case letters.\n15 Note that 'node' and 'collocate' are in par with the terms 'basis' and 'collocator' of the lexicographical\napproach. For the purpose of this thesis I will largely stick to the lexicographical terminology, but also\noccasionally use the linguistic expression, especially when referring to the computational approach.26\n2.3. Collocations in Phraseology\nGabrovsek (2000: 184) defines phraseology as \"the investigation of the lexical\nphenomenon of (significant) word combinations\".\nWe have seen in section 2.2. that there is no common descriptive approach to word\ncombinations, but what can be summarised from the above is that collocations are to be\nplaced somewhere in between free combinations, idioms and compounds16.\nCriteria which are frequently applied to distinguish collocations from free combinations,\nidioms and compounds are fixedness and semantic opacity (cf. Benson 1985;\nGabrovsek 2000 and 2003; Heliel 1990; Moon 1998).\n(1) Free combinations\nFree combinations, in line with Sinclair's open-choice principle, are sequences of words\nthat follow rules of grammar and syntax of the language in question, and whose\nelements allow for free substitution. They are the least cohesive types of word\ncombinations and the combination as a whole can be understood from the sum of the\nmost prototypical literal meanings of the elements. Examples are heavy bag, heavy\nbasket, heavy stone and beautiful flower, yellow flower, red flower.\n(2) Collocations\nCollocations are loosely fixed, typical and frequently co-occurring word combinations\nthat are put together out of some arbitrary usage. Collocations are semantically\ntransparent, i.e. their meanings can be derived from the denotative meaning of their\nconstituents, but the elements cannot be freely substituted. When we refer to a solar\neclipse, for example, we usually talk about a total eclipse and combinations with\nabsolute, complete, entire or whole are usually not accepted, while full eclipse can be.\n16 For the purpose of this thesis I will not go into detail concerning other multi-word units such as\nallusions, clich\u00e9s, proverbs, similes and the like.27\nSinclair (2004: 29) observes that \"many of these patterns seem almost purely linguistic\n([...], where on semantic grounds the adjectives should be interchangeable, but on\ncollocational grounds they are not).\"\nCharles Bally already (as quoted in B\u00e9joint 1994: 213) observed that the links between\nwords can be lexical ('contrainte de signe') rather than semantic ('contrainte the\ncontenu') and he illustrated this with his famous example gravement malade vs.\n* gri\u00e8vement malade.\nThis idea is also discussed by Bo Svens\u00e9n (1993: 98-102) who distinguishes lexical\nfrom semantic collocations. Semantic collocations are put together according to\nsemantic restrictions. The unacceptability of the utterance *the driver of the car was\nbadly damaged results from the fact that the verb to damage needs its direct object to\nhave the semantic feature [+inanimate] and not [+animate]. The bond between the\nelements in a lexical collocation, however, cannot be explained by either logic or\nsemantic reasons, but \"applies to the expressional aspect, and so relates to the choice of\nwords; its basis is simply in the way that usage has evolved.\" (ibid: 99). To demonstrate\nthis, he states that it is not clear why it is correct to say to make a trip, but *to make a\nwalk is not acceptable. \"Language simply seems to dictate, for no good semantic reason,\nthat such-and-such a combination does, or does not, occur. The restriction is, thus, an\narbitrary one.\" (Allerton 1984: 28).\n(3) Idioms\nIdioms are relatively fixed and semantically opaque word combinations. The criterion of\nsemantic opacity of idioms was defined by Sweet as early as 1899: \"The meaning of\neach idiom is an isolated fact which cannot be inferred from the meaning of the words\nof which the idiom is made up.\" (Sweet 1899: 139, as quoted in Skandera 2004: 24).\nWhen we give somebody the red carpet, for example, we do not actually hand over a red\ncarpet to them, but rather give them a special treatment as important visitors. Likewise,\nwhen someone makes heavy weather of something, this has nothing to do with an\natmospheric condition, but they make things more complicated than they need to be.28\nIn between collocations and idioms, there is yet another sub-category to be detected,\nthat of semi-idioms (or 'restricted collocations', as some linguists call them). By\ndefinition, semi-idioms consist of one literal and one figurative element, e.g. heavy\nheart where the literal meaning of heavy is 'tailored' to the figurative meaning of heart.\n(4) Compounds\nCompounds are completely frozen combinations of two (or sometimes even more)\nwords. They are referred to technically as 'endocentric' when the semantic head is\ninside the combination, i.e. the meaning of the whole combination characterises the\ndeterminatum, e.g. wet suit (= a special type of suit) and prime minister (= a special type\nof minister). 'Exocentric' compounds have their semantic head outside the combination\nand they denote an unknown variable, e.g. white elephant (= something that is\ncompletely useless although it might have cost a lot of money) and wet blanket (= a\nperson who spoils the joy of others).17\n2.3.1. Collocations vs. Free Combinations\nCollocations can be distinguished from free combinations by the restricted\ncommutability of the component elements as a typical result of semantic tailoring and\ntheir frequency of co-occurrence (cf. Aisenstadt 1979, Benson 1985, Heliel 1990 and\nBahns 1996).\n(1) restricted commutability of the component elements as a typical result of semantic\ntailoring\nIn the collocation heavy rain - where heavy means 'lots of / more than usual' - the\nnoun cannot be substituted freely since only a small number of nouns are permissible\nwithout changing the meaning of heavy, e.g. heavy frost I traffic I drinking I smoking.\n17 It was Leonard Bloomfield who introduced these technical terms in 1933 already.29\nLikewise, rain can only go with a certain number of other adjectives to express a (near-)\nsynonymous meaning to heavy, e.g. pouring I lashing I driving I torrential rain.\nIn free combinations like heavy bag both elements can be replaced by others, e.g. light I\nbrown I plastic I diplomatic I medical bag and heavy suitcase I basket I trunk I stone I\nboulder I box I umbrella.\nRestricted commutability can be inferred from what Allerton (1982 and 1984) calls\nsemantic tailoring. This is especially the case with adjective-noun collocations where\nthe meaning of the adjective is interpreted relative to the noun it modifies. This meaning\nis semantically tailored to the noun, i.e. it is \"different from its meanings in more\n'neutral' contexts\" (Heliel 1990: 130). To illustrate this let us look at the following\nexamples.\nheavy rain\nheavy schedule\nheavy furniture\nheavy sigh\nheavy soil= 'a lot of\n= 'busy'\n= 'large and solid'\n= 'loud and deep'\n= 'wet and sticky'\nFig. 6: Semantic tailoring\nIn a way, all the meanings of heavy in these collocations could be united through the\ncommon denominator \"emphasising that something is 'more' than usual\"; they are,\nhowever, specialised from context to context, i.e. from noun to noun. They are\nsemantically tailored to the noun.\nAs we will see later on, it is exactly this semantic tailoring that often results in\ninterlingual unpredictability of (primarily) the adjectives in the translation of adjective-\nnoun collocations.\n(2) frequency of co-occurrence\nAnother factor that distinguishes collocations from free combinations is their frequency\nof co-occurrence.30\nFrequency considerations in collocation studies date back to J.R. Firth and got a fresh\ninput with John McH. Sinclair's computational considerations starting in the 1970s ( cf.\n2.2.)\nOver the past thirty years computer technology has steadily improved, making it\npossible to compile all sorts of texts and store them electronically to form huge text\ncorpora which can be, with the help of specialised analysis tools, searched for patterns\nor statistical evidence (cf. 2.4. and 2.5.)\nWhen we nowadays speak of frequency of co-occurrence in collocational analysis, we\nsee this in terms of combined frequencies relative to the absolute frequencies each\ncomponent of the collocation has in isolation and the overall combinatorial ability of the\ntwo given lexical item as compared to combinations of any other lexical items in a\nlanguage.\nHence, the \"strength\" (Butler 1985: 7) of the collocation heavy schedule will be much\ngreater than the strength of the free combination heavy bag.\n2.3.2. Collocations vs. Idioms\nGenerally speaking, collocations can be distinguished from idioms by their semantic\ntransparency. While the meaning of a collocation can be derived from the literal\nmeanings of their constituent elements, idioms are semantically opaque, meaning that\nyou no longer can deduce the overall meaning of the combination by simply adding up\nthe literal/dictionary meaning of its component parts. The following examples illustrate\nthis.\nheavy rain = lots of + water that falls from the clouds in drops\n(make) heavy weather * lots of weight + the condition of the atmosphere at a\nparticular place and time\nFig. 7: Collocation vs. idiom31\nAnother criterion to differentiate between idioms and collocations is their (lexical and\ngrammatical) fixedness (Svens\u00e9n 1993: 109), e.g. while you can convert the adjective-\nnoun collocation heavy rain into a verb + noun structure, viz. to rain heavily, you\ncannot use the comparative or superlative forms of the adjective in to make heavy\nweather, nor can passivise it.\n2.3.3. Collocations vs. Compounds\nCompounds are usually defined as \"being one word (in the sense of lexeme) that is\nmade up of two other words (in the sense of lexeme)\" (Bauer 1998: 65).\nWhile compounding is primarily a branch of word formation, compounds are\nsometimes difficult to tell from syntactic combinations like collocations (ten Hacken\n2004: 53). So, what is it that differentiates a compound from a syntactic combination?\nThis is a question which has not yet been answered satisfactorily in the literature and\nopinions throughout the linguistic world are divided. They range from the difficult-to-\ndefine 'institutionalisation' criterion to the fact that compounds are stored together in\nthe mental lexicon.\nIn his article \"When is a Sequence of Two Nouns a Compound in English?\", Laurie\nBauer (1998) discusses six commonly found principles to distinguish between the two\ncategories:\n(a) compounds are listed, i.e. idiomatic\n(b) compounds are spelled as one word\n(c) compounds have fore stress\n(d) the first element in a compound is syntactically isolated, i.e. variation is uncommon\n(e) compounds do not permit co-ordination\n(f) the head of a compound cannot be replaced by 'one'32\nIn fact, as ten Hacken observes (2004: 55), each criterion that is applied to prove the\ncompound status of a given syntactic combination \"will lead to a slightly different set of\nitems [...], although there will of course be a large overlap between the sets\".\nAlso Bauer (1998: 83-84) remains unconvinced of a strict separation of compounds\nfrom other syntactic structures - a view which I entirely agree with.\nEndocentric compounds, in my opinion, are on a par with collocations on the one hand\nand with semi-idioms on the other hand18, while exocentric compounds are idioms. This\nview is challenged by lexicographic praxis in which compounds are separated from\ncollocations, semi-idioms and idioms (for a few well-known reasons such as\ninstitutionalisation, frequency and the 'two-item convention')19 and are treated as\nlexical items in their own right and thus get headword status, while collocations, semi-\nidioms and idioms are listed within the entries20. What supports my claim, however, is\nthat different dictionaries attribute headword status to different syntactic constructions.\nThere is no common lexicographical policy, as the following example (Table 1) shows:\nforegone conclusion\nCALD\nCOBUILD\nLDOCE\nMAC\nMW\nWNW\nNOAD\nOALD\nODE\nRHheadword\nlisted under the adjective, in sense 2 the combination is treated as if it was\nthe headword\nheadword\nheadword\nheadword\nlisted under the adjective, in sense 2 the combination is treated as\ncollocation ('as said of conclusion')\nlisted under the adjective and explicitly labelled 'phrase'\nlisted under the adjective and explicitly labelled 'idiom'\nlisted under the adjective and explicitly labelled 'phrase'\nheadword\nTable 1: Adjective + noun structures and headword policies as regards foregone conclusion\n18 Note that is far more common for an endocentric compound to be close to a collocation than to a semi-\nidiom.\n19 Gabrov\u00e4ek 2004: private communication\n20 Note that, here, I am talking about combinations (including compounds) which are spelled as two\nwords, hyphenated or not, which make the bulk of so-called English compounds - while in German\ncompounds are almost always spelled as a single word.33\nAs I will show in more detail in chapter 3-5, on the compilation of my dictionary, the\ndistinction between collocations and compounds does not cause any major difficulties,\nsince my policy is that any English adjective (or attributively used noun) + noun\nconstruction which can be semantically defined as a collocation (i.e. is not opaque) that\nis rendered into German by a single stretch of characters (I will call them 'authentic'\nGerman compounds), is listed in a special section in the entry (cf. I.4.). Accordingly,\nthe combination foregone conclusion would be presented in my dictionary as follows.\nconclusion\nforegone ausgemachte Sache | etc.\n\u2022 something is a foregone conclusion (be predetermined) etwas\nsteht von vornherein fest, (be certain) etwas ist so gut wie sicher\netc.\n\u2022 foregone conclusion Selbstverst\u00e4ndlichkeit f\netc.\nFig. 8: The treatment of foregone conclusion in the\nEnglish-German adjective-noun collocation dictionary\n2.3.4. The Phraseological Cline\nAs Gabrovsek (2003: 122) observes, most of the existing typologies of multi-word units\nrecognise the fact that there are bound to be overlaps between the categories and that\nthere are few discrete categories in the lexicon: things simply do not work like that (cf.\nMoon 1997: 48). This lends support to the notion of clines in lexical relations (cf.\nBolinger 1976, as quoted by Wray and Perkins 2000: 5). Speaking in phraseological\nterms, one cannot say that a combination is either this or that, but rather that it is closer\nto one category than to another.\nIn practical lexicography, however, you scarcely have any other choice but to assign\nlexical relations to different classes. As already pointed out above, different dictionaries\nhave different policies, and as long as they are applied consistently and spelled out in\nthe user's guide, nothing can be said against it, arbitrary as some groupings might seem.34\n2.3.5. Collocations in Other Linguistic Branches\nAs pointed out in the preceding sections, collocations are of major interest in\n(descriptive) phraseology and lexicography (notably Bahns 1996, Benson 1985, Cop\n1990 and 1991, Cowie 1986, Gabrovsek 1998a, Hausmann 1989 and 1991, Svens\u00e9n\n1993 and Ter-Minasova 1992). Other areas which have recently started to pay particular\nattention to collocations are second language acquisition and pedagogy (Bahns 1993,\nAlexander 1987, Ellis 1997, Farghal and Obiedat 1995, Hoey 2000, Howarth 1998,\nHussein 1990, Liontas 2002, Nattinger and DeCarico 1992 and Swan 1997), discourse\nanalysis (Stubbs 1996 and 2001) and translation studies (Baker 1992, Gabrovsek 2000,\nHeliel 1990, Maurer-Stroh 2003 and Roos 1976).\nWith the advent of a new generation of computers and the ever-increasing storage and\nprocessing capacities collocations, these days, are generally looked at and dealt with\ncomputationally. What had started in the early 1970s with J. McH. Sinclair and S. Jones\nhas turned into two interrelated disciplines21, corpus linguistics and computational\nlinguistics.\n2.4. Collocations and Corpus Linguistics\nFormerly defined as 'the body of written or spoken material upon which a linguistic\nanalysis is based'22, a corpus in its contemporary sense23 is an electronically stored\ncollection of text which is primarily used for linguistic analysis of any kind, be it for\ndescriptive purposes, as a basis for lexicographical considerations or in search for\nforensic evidence, just to mention a few possibilities.\n21 Note that the question whether corpus and computational linguistics are disciplines in their own right or\nrather methodologies that can be applied to all linguistic branches is still a controversial matter in the\nlinguistic community (cf. Borsley and Ingham 2003, Hunston 2002 and Meyer 2002). For the purpose of\nthis thesis I shall see them as two methodologies developed to deal with collocations in a lexicographical\nframework.\n22 First mentioned in this sense in 1956 (source: OED).\n23 See Leech 2002 for further historical statements and a brief overview of corpus linguistics.35\nAs Hunston (2002: 3) aptly puts it, \"a corpus by itself can do nothing at all, being\nnothing other than a store of used language. Corpus access software, however, can re-\narrange that store so that observations of various kinds can be made.\" Tools to generate\nfrequency lists and other statistical data as well as concordance programs are essential\nto capture and analyse data from corpora24.\n2.4.1. Concordances\nThe vital feature of a concordance program is the KWIC (= key word in context)\ndisplay. It shows the search term at the centre of a line that also contains the immediate\ncontext to the left and to the right of the search term (node). Such a list enables the\nlinguist to look at recurrent patterns and it gives hints at the usage of the node word, e.g.\ntypical collocations into which the word enters.\nhaunt/NN\ndays birdwatching.

The recurrent grammatical patterning reveals\nthat 'a place can be a /the (ADJ) haunt + OF someone'.\nLooking at concordance lines is only one way of detecting collocations in a corpus (and\nit can be very time-consuming and inefficient indeed when the node under scrutiny is a\nvery frequent word!). For more sophisticated searches, the corpus can be linguistically\nannotated26.\n2.4.2. Tagging\nOne method of annotation is part-of-speech tagging. With the help of a tagging program\n(in short: tagger) word-class labels27 are automatically assigned to the words in the\ncorpus, and such a tagged text would look like this28:\na_ART\ntownN\nsevere_thick_\n._PMADJ rain_N cloud_\nthe_ART weather\nADJ gales_N ._PM\nADJ\nART\nAUX\nNadjective\narticle\nauxiliary verb\nnounN\n_Nhung_VER\nforecast_N\nPM\nPRP\nVERover_PRP the_ART\nwas_AUX for_PRP\npunctuation mark\npreposition\nverb\nFig. 10: Example of a tagged text\n25 This concordance is an excerpt only and was generated by the free concordance and collocation\nsampler of Collins Wordbanks at http://www.collins.co.uk/Corpus/CorpusSearch.aspx [10/10/2004].\n26 Whether or not an annotated corpus is better then 'raw' text is still a controversial issue.\n27 Note that so-called 'tag-sets' vary considerably in different research centres.\n28 Those interested in an overview of different tagging methods should have a look at Linda Van\nGuilder's summary at http://www.qeoraetown.edu/facultv/ballc/iina361/taQQinq overview.html: Exemplarily, you\ncan try tagging your own text online at http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/ucrel/claws/trial.html (English) and\nhttp://www.coli.uni-sb.de/~thorsten/tnt/ (English and German) [all 10/10/2004].37\nTagged corpora allow for concordances of a specific part of speech of a node which can\ntake on different word classes. In Fig. 3, for example, I used such a tagged corpus and\nexplicitly searched for instances of haunt as a noun.\n2.4.3. Parsing\nAnother annotation method is parsing. In a nutshell, parsing is automatic syntactic\nanalysis in which sentences are broken down into their constituents, i.e. words and\nphrases. With the help of parsed corpora, so-called 'treebanks'29, structures in any given\nlanguage, can easily be identified.\nAs Fig. 6 shows, parsed corpora are also valuable as regards collocation analysis. In the\ntwo nominal phrases we can detect two adjective-noun collocations, viz. laboratory\nassistant and brutal murder, and one verb-noun collocation in the verbal phrase, viz. to\ncommit a murder.\nthe laboratory assistant\nNP\nthe laboratory assistant\nDET ADJ NI\ncommitted a brutal murder\nVP\nI ,\nI I\ncommitted a brutal murder\nV NP\nI\na brutal murder\nDET ADJ N\nFig. 11 : Example of a parsed sentence\n29 Treebanks \u2014 this term was coined by Geoffrey Leech \u2014 are still very rare, the most important ones for\nEnglish are the Susanne Corpus, the Penn Treebank and the Lancaster Parsed Corpus, while the most\nprominent German project is TigerSearch conducted at the IMS Stuttgart.38\n2.4.4. Corpus Linguistics, Collocations and Areas of Application\nIn the following I will briefly outline two linguistic branches in which corpus linguistics\nhas started to play a major role. I will restrict myself to areas which are associated with\nthe topic of this thesis: lexicography and translation30.\n(1) Lexicography\nAlthough Sinclair may well be seen as the father of computerised lexicography in the\ncorpus linguistic sense, the first use of computers in the dictionary-making process dates\nfrom the early 1970s - when the compilation of the third edition of the Oxford\nAdvanced Learner's Dictionary included a computerised stage to turn the text into a\nprint book (Cowie 1999: 118).\nSinclair's name is inseparably associated with the COBUILD31 project which pioneered\nthe corpus-based approach to produce widely acclaimed English monolingual dictionary\nfor advanced learners, first published in 1987. They used computers to compile a corpus\nespecially designed for lexicography32, applied the corpus frequency list as one of the\ncriteria for the headword list, analysed concordance lines for sense discrimination and\nincluded 'authentic' example sentences in their dictionary (cf. Sinclair 1987b). Since\nthen, every major (new) dictionary project followed their example and started using\ncorpora, in one way or another, in the compilation process.\nSue Atkins broke new ground in 1994 when working on the new Oxford-Hachette\nFrench Dictionary. Her team used two comparable (in terms of size and contents)\ncorpora, one English and one French, in order to produce their bilingual dictionary.\n30 Very good (introductory) textbooks on corpus linguistics and its applications are, inter alia, Hunston\n2002, Kennedy 1998 and Meyer 2002.\n31 Collins Birmingham University International Language Database.\n32 The corpus consisted of over seven million words of written and spoken British English (cf. Cowie\n1999: 118).39\nAlthough collocation dictionaries existed before (cf. I.3.), the first (monolingual)\ncollocation dictionary entirely based on an electronic corpus was G. Kjellmer's A\nDictionary of English Collocations.\nThis dictionary comes in three large volumes and was published in 1994. What makes it\nproblematic as a collocation source, however, is that their policy included any sequence\nof words that was grammatically correct and came up at least once in the corpus33 was\nincluded, thus comprising also combinations like the diamond, did I, did all, did not\nlook at him, be retrieved from the dictionary.\n(2) Translation\nIn her introductory textbook on corpus linguistics, Hunston (2002: 123) states that the\nuse of corpora in translation and translation studies is becoming more and more\nimportant. Indeed, corpora can be a useful reference tool for translators.\nMonolingual corpora can be used like monolingual dictionaries, that is, the translator\nknows the target language (TL) equivalent of the source language (SL) term. The corpus\ncan then be searched for the phraseological behaviour of the term by looking at the\nconcordance lines.\nImagine the following scenario: You are a German translator and have to translate ein\nTelefonat f\u00fchren (literally to conduct a phone call) into English, but you are not sure\nabout the verb. You search an English monolingual corpus for a concordance of phone\ncall.\nWith an output as shown in Fig. 12, you will surely be able to find the correct\ntranslation equivalent of the phrase.\n33 Kjellmer's dictionary is based on the one-million-word Brown Corpus of American English.40\nthe front door and make a phone call dialling with a pencil\nor a drought by making a phone call .

Then we started getting phone calls that there was an invasion\nround in my nightie making phone-calls and coffee and occasionally\nloved to watch TV and make phone calls , Boffins at the French\nFig. 12: Concordance of phone call*\nWhile monolingual corpora are a valuable help in the translation process, the typical\ncorpus in translation research is a parallel corpus consisting of two subcorpora, one\ncontaining texts originally written in the SL and the other one containing the translation\nof those texts into the TL.\nThese parallel corpora have to be aligned - at least at sentence level (so that sentence 22\nin the SL sub-corpus is equivalent to sentence 22 in the TL sub-corpus) - in order to run\nparallel concordance programs, such as ParaConc34, on the corpus.\nWhen the concordancer searches through the text, the only information the program has\nabout the links between the different languages is the alignment. No use is made of\nbilingual dictionaries or of any kind of language-particular information. (Barlow 2002:\nI)-\nIn an earlier study of mine (Maurer-Stroh 2003), I compiled a parallel corpus of German\nand English to demonstrate the use of this type of corpus for translation. The corpus\nconsists of original German tourism texts and their translations into English, together\namounting to 11,004 words (tokens).\nThe translator can use the parallel corpus as a bilingual dictionary in terms of looking\nfor word combinations. If, for example, the translator wants to know which adjectives\ngo with winter (as noun or part of a composite noun compound), ParaConc run on my\n(manually) tagged corpus would produce the following useful information (Table 2):\n34 Michael Barlow's ParaConc can be purchased from http://www.athel.com/para.html [10/10/2004].41\nGerman\nunvergessliche Wintererlebnisse\ntolle Winterferien\nw\u00e4hrschafte Winterspezialit\u00e4ten\nprominente Wintersportdorados\npr\u00e4chtiger Wintertag\nstrahlende WintertageEnglish\nunforgettable winter moments\ngood winter holidays\nfabulous winter specialities\nprominent winter sport dorados\nfine winter's day\nsunny winter days\nTable 2: Results of the bilingual extraction of word pairs\nThe bilingual adjective + noun (phrase) structures as seen in Table 2 can be obtained by\nanalysing the parallel concordance lines resulting from the query 'retrieve all\noccurrences of winter as a noun which are preceded by an adjective from the English\nsub-corpus together with their German equivalent structures in the German sub-corpus;\nKWIC-sort words in German which have winter as one of their components'.\n... _IN toJN you_PP._.

However, there are relatively few corpora\nof this type available35.\n35Secondly, (language-independent) taggers still lack the desired accuracy for more sophisticated queries.42\nOne of the major drawbacks to using monolingual reference corpora in practical\ntranslation is that translators, in general, do not have time to study and analyse all these\nconcordance lines (online), nor are there enough suitable (in size, design and language)\ncorpora available to meet the translators' needs, e.g. collocation retrieval requires a\nhuge collection of data as well as appropriate software packages - which are normally\nnot available free of charge.\nA less complicated method for translation-related information retrieval is to use the\nWorld Wide Web (= WWW) as a corpus: \"A haphazard accumulation of machine-\nreadable texts, the World Wide Web is unparalleled for quantity, diversity and\ntopicality. This ever-expanding body of documents now encompasses at least 10 billion\n(109) webpages publicly available via links, with several times that number in the\n\"hidden\" Web accessible only through database queries or passwords.\" (Fletcher 2004:\n2).\nIf, for example, the translator is not sure whether the adjective fastidious goes with the\npreposition about or on, the easiest way to find out via the WWW is using a search\nengine (e.g. Google) and querying \"fastidious about\" as opposed to \"fastidious on\". The\nnumber of hits will show which construction is more frequent, e.g. fastidious about =\n15,900 times vs. fastidious on = 214 times36.\nSince Jones and Sinclair in the early 1970s, corpus linguistics, in both the monolingual\nand bi- or multilingual frameworks, has moved towards statistical methods for the\nextraction of collocations. These methods can be summarised within a section on\ncomputational linguistics.\n36 These figures are from 13/11/04. In my 2003 paper the same query resulted in 4,430 \"about\" and 18\n\"on\" cases!43\n2.5. Collocations and Computational Linguistics\nThe projects in which computational methods are used for collocation analysis and\nprocessing are almost countless. In this section, therefore, I will briefly outline only\nsome historical aspects and provide terminological preliminaries while also focusing on\nprojects which are of immediate interest to my research.\nAs summarised in McKeown and Radev (2000), early work on statistical extraction of\ncollocations from corpora was done by Choueka et al. in 1983. Their team used raw\nfrequencies to identify typical sequences of two to six adjacent words. Their work\npioneered the statistical approach to collocations in as much as they used a (for that\ntime) relatively large electronic corpus, one consisting of 11 million words from texts of\nthe New York Times. The drawback of their method, however, was that because of the\nuse of raw frequency only, the results were highly dependent on the corpus size.\nAnother disadvantage of a list of raw frequencies, like the one in the Choueka et al.'s\napproach, is that it is impossible to attach a degree of relative significance to the\ncombinations.\nAccordingly, Church et al. (1991) used a correlation-based statistical method to extract\ncollocations from corpora. They saw collocations as two (not necessarily adjacent)\nwords that appeared together more often than would be expected by chance. Their\nsignificance measure was mutual information (MI)37, which, very generally speaking,\ncompares the actual co-occurrence of the two words with their expected co-occurrence\nif the words in the corpus were to occur in a totally random order. In other words, the\nMi-score indicates the strength of a collocation (Hunston 2002: 71).\nAlthough Church et al.'s method was less sensitive to corpus size, it was restricted to\nextracting only collocations consisting of two words.\n37 Another measure of significance, usually found in the literature, is the t-score (or t-test). The t-score\nuses \"a calculation of standard deviation which takes into account the probability of co-occurrence of the\nnode and its collocate and the number of tokens in the designated span in all lines.\" (Hunston 2002: 70).\nIn short, the t-score measures the certainty of a collocation (ibid: 73). Yet other statistical formulas are\nz-score, log-likelihood ratio, chi-square, cubic association ratio, common birthday, etc. For a detailed\noverview see Manning and Sch\u00fctze 1999 and Oakes 1998.44\nFrank Smadja (1993) and his team developed a system which not only uses significant\nmeasures (here, the z-score), but also draw on filters based on linguistic properties, such\nas syntax and semantics. Smadja had the results of the different stages of their tool\nXtract tested by a lexicographer and this evaluation clearly showed the necessity of\ncombining statistical and linguistic information, in syntax in particular.\nOn the basis of Xtract, Smadja et al. (1996) developed a bilingual collocation extractor\ncalled Champollion\u2122. Champollion uses a statistical method to translate collocations\nbetween French and English using the Canadian Hansard Corpus (which contains\nbilingual reports from the proceedings of the Canadian parliament). Champollion's\noutput is a bilingual list of collocations which can be implemented in machine\ntranslation systems.\nMore recent approaches of bilingual collocation extraction39 include the DECIDE\nproject40 which ran in 1994-1996 and drew on data from raw and tagged corpora as well\nas bilingual dictionaries.\nAnother such project was KoKs (= Korpusbasierte Kollolkationssuche, viz. corpus-\nbased collocation search)41, which was carried out between 2000 and 2002. The aim of\nKoKs was to build a lexicon for collocations from parallel German and English corpora\nand existing bilingual dictionaries.\nThere is yet another project which I would like to present, the ANCR (= The Adjective-\nNoun Collocation Retriever). ANCR developed from a discussion between my brother\nDr. Sebastian Maurer-Stroh, then at the Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna,\n38 Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion (1790 - 1832), a French egyptologist, deciphered the famous Rosetta stone.\nThe Rosetta stone is, amongst corpus linguists, usually referred to as the first 'parallel corpus' since the\nwritings on it were carved in two languages (Egyptian and Greek) using three different scripts\n(hieroglyphic, demotic and Greek).\n39 Prominent researchers in bilingual computational and corpus linguistics are, inter alia, Thierry\nFontenelle, Philipp Koehn, Franz-Josef Och, Wolfgang Teubert and Jean V\u00e9ronis.\n40 Details about DECIDE can be found on their website at http://enqdep1 .philo.ulq.ac.be/decide/ [10/10/2004].\n41 The homepage of KoKs is available at http://www.coasci.uni-osnabrueck.de/~koks/main/index e.html\n[10/10/2004].45\nand myself. The project was launched as a joint undertaking of different departments at\nthe University of Klagenfurt in summer 2003. The aim of ANCR is to automatically\nretrieve German and English adjective-noun collocations from a parallel corpus without\nhaving to linguistically pre-process or annotate the two corpora. The bilingual\ncollocation retrieval is based on probability counts and uses several filters, e.g. German\ncapitalisation (Fliedl et al. 2004). Our method and evaluation of the tool will be\ndiscussed in more detail in chapter 5.\nStatistical extraction of German and English collocations is also done within the\nframework of Projekt Deutscher Wortschatz. This project does not, however, combine\nthe two languages but offers online collocation tools for both languages42.\nWithout wishing to belittle major achievements in (bilingual) computational linguistics /\ncollocation research, let me conclude this chapter by a quotation which should make us\nremember that we are dealing with 'language' not 'strings of characters' before we turn\nto collocations in the contrastive light.\n\"Phraseological significance means something more complex and possibly less tangible\nthan what any computer algorithm can reveal.\"\n(P.A. Howarth 1998: 27)\n42See their web page at http://wortschatz.uni-leipziQ.de/ [10/10/2004]46\n3. Contrastivity\nAs already pointed out in section 1.2., collocations are largely language-specific, i.e.\ninterlingually, \"the structural and semantic 'images' of such phrases will often be\ndifferent\" (Gabrovsek 2000: 212). While in English, a person who smokes a lot is\nreferred to as heavy smoker, in German we refer to them as starker Raucher (lit. trans.\nstrong smoker). Or, the English main entrance is rendered into German as an\n\"authentic\" compound (cf. 2.3.3.), Haupteingang, thus being incongruent in structure,\nyet semantically 100% predictable, since main = Haupt and entrance = Eingang.\nHowever, there are also semantically predictable and structurally congruent translation\nequivalents to be found in the language pair English and German, e.g. rancid butter vs.\nranzige Butter or rich harvest vs. reiche Ernte.\nDepending on (in-)congruence and/or (un-)predictability of the combinations in the\ninterlingual context, \"one should really try to work out a more detailed contrastive\n'difficulty scale'\" (GabrovSek 2000: 214), since \"there have been so far few attempts at\nidentifying or categorizing them.\" (ibid: 215).\nBut first things first. While collocations in the monolingual framework are nowadays\nusually seen as a statistical, i.e. frequency-based, concept (cf. Chapter 2), the analysis\nand treatment of collocations in the bilingual framework call for criteria other than sheer\nnumbers.\nContrasting two languages is like dealing with two sides of the same coin. On the one\nside you decode (= comprehend) a foreign text (written or spoken), while on the other\nside you encode (= produce) a text in a foreign language. It is particularly in the\nencoding process that problems can arise since speakers tend to rely on the hypothesis\nof transferability (cf. section 1.2.).\nMost collocational errors are due to LI interference, where the speaker simply translates\nan LI collocation word-by-word into the L2 (cf. I.2.). This is a consequence of the\nnative speakers' unawareness of the arbitrary, i.e. not semantically but rather usage-\nbased, nature of collocations in their mother tongue (cf. 2.3.). However, the fact that47\nthere are indeed - interlingually - collocations that are 'exact' word-by-word\ntranslations (e.g. starless night vs. sternlose Nacht) underscores the need for a special\ntreatment of collocations in the contrastive light.\nFor the purpose of this thesis, I shall see the term contrastivity as an umbrella term for\nstructural (in-)congruence and semantic (un-)predictability (cf. Gabrovsek 2000: 214-17\nand 223).\n3.1. Predictable and Structurally Congruent Combinations\nSemantically predictable and structurally congruent collocations are in principle the\neasiest-to-encode category of interlingual collocations. They account for the fact that,\nalthough the collocational ranges of LI and L2 items might differ, there are certain\noverlaps to be found which result in direct, i.e. word-by-word, translation equivalents\n(cf. Gabrovsek 1998b: 129 and Heliel 1990: 131), e.g. wet nappy vs. nasse Windel and\nheavy scent vs. schwerer Duft. In addition to their semantic predictability, they reveal\nthe same structure, namely adjective + noun, and belong to the same category, i.e.\ncollocation (as defined in section 2.3.).\nSome linguists argue that in the contrastive pedagogical and lexicographical framework\nthese combinations should play a minor role as compared to 'more difficult-to-encode\ncombinations' like unpredictable and structurally incongruent ones (cf. Bahns 1993 and\nGabrovsek 2000: 212-18 and 222-23).\nThe problem with this view is where to draw the dividing line in practical lexicography,\nespecially also with respect to the notion of 'reassurance' on the part of the dictionary\nuser. Let me illustrate this with an example.\nWhile wet nappy and nasse Windel have semantically predictable constituents and are\nstructurally congruent, how can the English speaker be sure that the somewhat\nsemantically tailored sense of wet as 'soaked with urine' is the same in German, i.e. that\nthe core sense of the adjective nass can be tailored to the noun Windel.48\nTo overcome this problem, in view of my English-German adjective-noun collocation\ndictionary, I base the selection of included adjective (and attributively-used-noun)\ncollocators not only on monolingual dictionaries and corpora, but also on existing\nbilingual dictionaries. Consequently, the collocations listed include those that are\nimportant, i.e. frequent, on the English monolingual side but that do not show\ndifficulties in the bilingual light since they are predictable and congruent, e.g. important\ndiscovery vs. wichtige Entdeckung. Furthermore, contrastive collocations that show\nminor monolingual significance, i.e. that are less frequent than other items in the\ncollocational range in question, but are of importance from the contrastive angle, will\nlikewise be included, e.g. on an equal basis vs. auf gleicher Basis or als\n[gleichgestellte^)] Partner. The inclusion policy is entirely based on the sources\nmentioned.\n3.2. Predictable and Structurally Incongruent Combinations\nThis class comprises contrastive combinations like main entrance vs. Haupteingang and\nprime minister vs. Premierminister, where both constituents of the combination are\n100% predictable, but the combinations as such exhibit a different structure (and what\none frequently finds are compounds on the German side). Other examples of predictable\nbut structurally incongruent combinations are red pencil vs. Rotstift and used car vs.\nGebrauchtwagen. Combinations of this type need special attention since they can also\nbe rendered into German as structurally congruent translations, viz. roter Stift and\ngebrauchtes Auto1.\nI deliberately use the term 'combination' here rather than 'collocation' since it is\narguable whether premier minister, main entrance, used car and red pencil are\ncollocations, or, for the sake of institutionalisation or something else, compounds. As\npointed out in section 2.3.3., for my English-German adjective noun collocation\ndictionary it matters very little which phraseological category the four combinations\n1 Auto and Wagen are both translation equivalents of car, Auto is more frequently used with adjectives,\nwhile Wagen predominates in compounding.49\nbelong to, because the fact that they are all rendered into German with a different\nstructure makes them perfect candidates for inclusion (see Fig. 1 below).\ncar\nused gebrauchtes Auto | etc.\n\u2022 used car Gebrauchtwagen m\netc.\nentrance\n\u2022 main entrance Haupteingang m\netc.\nminister\n\u2022 prime minister Premierminister m\netc.\npencil\nred roter Stift | etc.\n\u2022 red pencil Rotstift m\netc.\nFig. 14: Examples of predictable and structurally incongruent combination and their treatment in the\nEnglish-German adjective-noun collocation dictionary\n3.3. Unpredictable and Structurally Congruent Combinations\nExamples of unpredictable yet structurally congruent combinations in English and\nGerman include heavy smoker vs. starker Raucher (lit. trans, strong smoker), barefaced\nlie vs. faustdicke L\u00fcge (lit. trans, a lie as thick as a fist) and magic carpet vs. fliegender\nTeppich (lit. trans, flying carpet).\nNote that the unpredictable element in adjective-noun combinations is almost\nexclusively the adjective. One of the few exceptions is (the idiom or compound) green\nfingers - which is rendered into German as gr\u00fcner Daumen (lit. trans, green thumb).50\n3.4. Unpredictable and Structurally Incongruent Combinations\nUnpredictable and structurally incongruent collocations are a class which needs special\nattention in the contrastive analysis of collocations. According to Banns (1997: 108)\nthere is no such thing as 100% unpredictability and structural incongruence in\ncontrastive collocations since the fulfilment of the two criteria would make them fall\nunder the category of idioms.\nAs part of the material on which my dictionary entries are based is taken from English\ncollocation dictionaries and general bilingual ones, the question where to draw the\ndividing line between collocations and idioms (and semi-idioms) is not an issue since I\ninclude those combinations which are recorded in the dictionaries in question and show\ncorpus evidence. Consequently, I include the English on a first-come first-served basis,\nalthough it is translated into German as the idiomatic expression nach dem Prinzip 'Wer\nzuerst kommt, mahlt zuerst' (lit. trans, on the principle that 'Who comes first, grinds\nfirst'; cf. the English proverb the early bird catches the worm).\nAnother such example that would be included in the English-German adjective-noun\ncollocation dictionary is to have no sound basis which can be rendered into German as\nthe figurative expression auf wackeligen F\u00fc\u00dfen stehen (lit. trans, to be a bit shaky on\none 'sfeef).\nLikewise, the English semi-idiom2 in broad daylight would be included. Its German\nequivalent is am hellichten Tag(e): We cannot possibly equate broad with hellichten\n(which is, above all, only used in the combination with Tag(e) and does not exist\nelsewhere), nor can we relate daylight (lit. trans. Tageslicht) to Tag (lit. trans, day).\nIt goes without saying that those instances of idiomatic, highly restricted or figurative\nuses are meta-lexicographically labelled in the entries.\n2 The expression is idiomatic in the sense that the adjective broad is only used as a kind of intensifier in\nthis combination (Gabrov\u00e4ek 2004: private communication).51\n3.5. Case Studies\nIn the following, two case studies will demonstrate the need for a bilingual collocation\ndictionary.\n3.5.1. English Collocations and Their Translations in Bilingual Dictionaries\nBy way of investigating the provision of adjective-noun collocations in existing\nbilingual dictionaries, the first case study is designed, first, to show that there is indeed\na need for an English-German adjective-noun collocation dictionary since translating\nrequires information on collocational possibilities, and in the absence of such\ninformation, the translator or learner has to rely on dictionaries (Heliel 1990: 134).\nSecond, this case study examines whether bilingual dictionaries of German and English\nuse any contrastive filters in their inclusion policies.\nI took 18 random adjective-noun collocations from each of the three English collocation\ndictionaries, the BBI, LTP and OCD. From the resulting 54 collocations 14 were found\nin all three English collocation dictionaries; these are: irresistible attraction,\nunshakeable belief, insurmountable difficulty, strenuous exercise, invaluable help,\ncomplete ignorance, false impression, pressing matter, selfish motive, unsolved mystery,\nrough outline, enormous pressure, sweeping reform and deep respect. Another 15 were\nrecorded in two of the collocation dictionaries in question; these include: established\nauthor, gentle breeze, insatiable curiosity, nice guy, vivid illustration, overwhelming\njoy, grand opera, doubtful origin, utter perfection, abandoned property, close shave,\ncrisp snow, stubborn stain, distorted vision and sharp wit.\nI checked these 29 collocations in the four major comprehensive bilingual dictionaries\nof English and German: DUOX, COGER, PONS and LANGE. The main criterion was\nthat the collocation is mentioned, i.e. given explicitly.\nAs can be seen in Table 1, the best result is achieved with PONS. 51.7% of the tested\ncollocations were found in either the adjective or the noun entry. Making use of all of52\nthe bilingual dictionaries in the translation task would result in 79.3% explicitly\nmentioned collocations.\nSix collocations out of the 29, however, are not recorded in any of the dictionaries in the\nstudy . These are insurmountable difficulty, pressing matter, utter perfection, enormous\npressure, deep respect and distorted vision. The reason why they are not listed in the\ndictionaries could be that they are all semantically predictable (i.e. the most core sense\nof the adjective can be translated predictably into German) and structurally congruent.\nCOLLOCATIONS\nestablished\nunshakeable\ngentle\nInsatiable\ninsurmountable\nstrenuous\nnice\ninvaluable\ncomplete\nvivid\nfalse\noverwhelming\npressing\nselfish\nunsolved\ngrand\ndoubtful\nrough\nutter\nenormous\nabandoned\nsweeping\ndeep\nclose\ncrisp\nstubborn\ndistorted\nsharpauthor\nbelief\nbreeze\ncuriosity\ndifficulty\nexercise\nguy\nhelp\nignorance\nillustration\nimpression\njoy\nmatter\nmotive\nmystery\nopera\norigin\noutline\nperfection\npressure\nproperty\nreform\nrespect\nshave\nsnow\nstain\nvision\nwitOCD\n-\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n-\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nXBBI\nX\nX\nX\n-\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n-\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n-\nX\n-\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n-\nXLTP\nX\nX\n-\nX\nX\nX\n-\nX\nX\nX\nX\n-\nX\nX\nX\n-\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n-\n-\n-\nX\n-\nCOLLOCATIONS FOUND\nPERCENTAGEDUOX\nADJ\n-\nADJ\nADJ\n-\n-\n-\nADJ\nADJ\nADJ\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nHW\nADJ\nADJ\n-\n-\nADJ\nADJ\n-\nN, ADJ\nADJ\n-\n-\nADJ\n14\n48.3%COGER\n-\n-\nADJ\nADJ\n-\n-\nADJ\nADJ\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nADJ\nHW\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nN\nADJ\nADJ\n-\nADJ\n10\n34.5%PONS\n-\nADJ\nADJ\n-\n-\nADJ\nADJ\nADJ\n-\n-\nADJ\nADJ\n-\nADJ\nADJ\nHW\n-\n-\n-\nADJ\nN\n-\nN,ADJ\nADJ\nADJ\n-\n-\n15\n51.7%LANGE\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nN, ADJ\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1\n3.4%\nTable 3: English collocations and their distribution in English-German general bilingual dictionaries\nInterestingly, only one collocation can be found in all bilingual dictionaries, namely\nclose shave. DUOX, COGER and PONS all record both the literal and the figurative use\n1 Note that I used the print dictionaries for this case study, so no full-text search was possible.53\nof the combination while LANGE only lists the figurative sense. In its literal sense,\nclose shave has to be rendered into German as the \"authentic\" compound Glattrasur (lit.\ntrans, smooth shave). It is thus unpredictable (due to the adjective) and structurally\nincongruent. The figurative reading of close shave, namely 'a situation in which you\nonly just avoid an accident, a disaster, etc.', is 100% unpredictable and structurally\nincongruent in German:\nI had a close shave. Ich bin gerade noch / mit knapper Not davongekommen.\nThat was a close shave! Das war knapp!\nSimilarly, four collocations are recorded in three of the four bilingual dictionaries I\ntested: gentle breeze, invaluable help, grand opera and crisp snow. While invaluable\nhelp can be translated into German word-by-word, the meaning of the adjective crisp is\ntailored to the noun snow. This makes the collocation, although structurally congruent,\nsemantically unpredictable since the translator needs to know with which word the\nspecialised sense of the adjective crisp is rendered into German, the direct translation\nequivalent of the most core sense of crisp (viz. knusprig) or a more specialised\nadjective that attributes the property of crisp to snow (viz. verharscht).\nThe combination grand opera is another interesting example. Although its German\nequivalent, gro\u00dfe Oper, is 100% predictable and structurally congruent, the\ncombination as such can be seen as a semi-idiom (or an endocentric compound of\ncourse) in as much as the adjectives grand I gro\u00df have the meaning 'only sung, no\nspoken parts' only in combination with opera. Furthermore, DUOX, COGER and\nPONS all assign headword status to the combination.\nThe collocation gentle breeze can be translated into German as either a predictable and\ncongruent collocation, viz. sanfte / leichte / schwache Brise, or as a structurally\nincongruent and unpredictable German simplex word, viz. L\u00fcftchen.\nSummarising, if we take minimum occurrence in three of the four dictionaries as our\nthreshold, collocations in present-day bilingual dictionaries are included whether they\nare predictable and congruent or unpredictable and congruent or unpredictable and54\nincongruent (see Table 2), so there seem to have been no specific contrastive filters\nimplemented.\npredictable / congruent\nunpredictable / congruent\nunpredictable / incongruent(3) invaluable help, grand opera, gentle breeze\n(3) crisp snow\n(4) close shave, close shave, (3) gentle breeze\nTable 4: Inclusion policy of contrastive collocation categories in present-day bilingual dictionaries\nHowever, if this policy had been consistently applied, also the six predictable and\ncongruent collocations which are not recorded in any of the bilingual dictionaries I\ntested would have been listed (insurmountable difficulty, pressing matter, utter\nperfection, enormous pressure, deep respect and distorted vision).\nAt this point I should mention once again that the English-German adjective-noun\ncollocation dictionary will consistently include all four contrastive categories (cf.\nsections 3.1. to 3.4.). The criteria I use are monolingual corpus frequency as well as\nmonolingual collocation dictionary data combined with full-text search in bilingual\ndictionaries.\n3.5.2. English and German Adjective-Noun Combinations and Machine\nTranslation\nMachine Translation (hereafter MT) is (the process of) automatic translation from one\nnatural language to another by a computer. Although patent applications of 'translation\nmachines' started as early as the 1930s, commercial computer-assisted tools only\nbecame available first in the 1980s (cf. G\u00f4mez 2003).\nRecently, the internet with its multilingual coverage fuelled a real boom in MT - which\nhas been made possible by ever-better computational linguistic methods. While search55\nengines like Google or Altavista4 offer automatic translation of whole web pages, there\nare also some pages where the user can type in their own texts and have them translated\ninto various languages for free. The leading tools among them are\nFree2ProfessionalTranslation (PROF), Promt-Online (PROM), Softissimo (SOFT),\nand Systran (SYST)5.\nSo, how good are such MT tools when it comes to the automatic translation of\nadjective-noun collocations?\nThe second case study serves to illustrate that the automatic translation of collocations\n(and other word combinations in this respect) is the poor relation of collocational\nresearch in computational linguistics.\nI randomly chose 30 English and 30 German adjective-noun combinations (including\nfree combinations, endocentric compounds, collocations, semi-idioms, idioms and\nexocentric compounds) and evaluated the outputs of both the four online MT tools\nmentioned above (PROF, PROM, SOFT, SYST) and the commercial MT product from\nLangenscheidt, Langensscheidt 's T1 (Version 5.0).\nThe following adjective-noun combinations were translated from German into English:\nrote Blume, h\u00f6lzerne T\u00fcr, gem\u00fctliches Sofa, silberner Knopf, offenes Fenster Rotstift,\nSchnellstra\u00dfe, Gebrauchtwagen, (im Gesch\u00e4ft herrschte) Hochbetrieb, Geheimbund,\nschwere See, reiche Ernte, starker Raucher, schwere Last, haushoher Favorit, faustdicke\nL\u00fcge, blinder Passagier, kalter Krieg, schwerer Schlag, trockener Wein, (etwas auf die)\nlange Bank (schieben), der kleine Mann, (fern.) gr\u00fcnes Licht (geben), kalte F\u00fc\u00dfe\n(bekommen), (bei jem. ein) offenes Ohr (finden), Junggeselle, Sch\u00f6ngeist, Blondschopf,\nMilchgesicht und (ein) Dickkopf (sein).\nThe English adjective-noun collocations I tested in MT tools included the following:\nyellow flower, bus ticket, interesting book, poor actor, sunny day, prime minister, magic\ncarpet, yellow pages, wet suit, general strike, stale bread, dry country, main entrance,\nheavy smoker, poor actor, naked truth, (see something with the) naked eye, white\nChristmas, (in) broad daylight, dry cow, (give the) red carpet, (appear in its) true colours /\n(show one 's) true colours, (have) green fingers, full steam (ahead), smart money (is on\nsomebody / something), wet blanket, musical chair, blackmail, lame duck, sitting duck.\n4 Both search engines use Systran technology.\n5 The relevant links can be found in Appendix B.56\nTo be able to judge which phraseological category is the 'easiest' for the MT tools to\nhandle correctly; for starters, I only take into consideration combinations which have\nbeen properly translated by all five tools.\nRegardless of the translation direction, 12 of the 60 combinations (20%) are correctly\ntranslated by all machines. These include five free combinations (41.67%), two\nendocentric compounds (16.67%), one collocation (8.33%), two semi-idioms (16.67%),\nno idioms (0%) and two exocentric compounds (16.67%): bus ticket, sunny day,\ninteresting book, rote Blume, offenes Fenster, Schnellstra\u00dfe, Gebrauchtwagen, main\nentrance, kalter Krieg, trockener Wein, Junggeselle and blackmail.\n45%\n40%\n35%\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\nFree Endocentric Collocations Semi-idioms Idioms Exocentric\ncombinations compounds compounds\nFig. 15: Categories of correct translation of all five MT tools57\nWhen we look at Fig. 2, a certain trend can be observed, namely that the more\n'restricted' combinations become semantically and structurally, the less likely are they\nto be correctly translated by the MT tools (free combinations - endocentric compounds\n- collocations - idioms). What is striking, however, is the unexpected results of semi-\nidioms and exocentric compounds in this graph.\nThe reason why exocentric compounds are more often correctly translated than\ncollocations, as I see it, is, first, due to the fact that they are more striking, overall,\nsemantically institutionalised than collocations. That means that in MT tools where\nexisting bilingual lexicons and grammars are implemented, they can often be readily\ntranslated.\nSecondly, what with statistical programming techniques, the fact that endocentric\ncompounds are semantically unpredictable and, for the most part, structurally\nincongruent, i.e. that they are spelled as one word in German, makes them easier to deal\nwith in MT than collocations. In other words, when looking at endocentric compounds\nfrom the contrastive angle, they are more salient in the computational view than are\ncollocations - which the computer has difficulties distinguishing from free\ncombinations.\nAlso the digression of semi-idioms can be explained by these two reasons. First, semi-\nidioms, having one highly restricted, viz. unpredictable, element are more likely to be\nfound in existing bilingual dictionaries which are implemented in MT tools. Secondly,\nin statistical terms, the fact that contrastive semi-idioms are very unlikely to be word-\nby-word translations from one language into the other and that their combined\nsignificance with respect to their translations as opposed to the frequency of their\nconstituents is rather high, makes them easier to deal with than collocations.\nWhat is also interesting to observe from this case study is the following ranking of the\nMT tools6:\n6 Note that, in this study, the commercial product, Tl, is only in the middle and SYST - which is used by\nmany search engines - is next to last.58\n1. PROM (32 out of 60 correct = 53,33%)\n2. SOFT (30 correct = 50%)\n3. T1 (27 correct = 45%)\n4. SYST (25 correct = 41,67%)\n5. PROF (24 correct = 60%)\nBy way of concluding this chapter, let me point out that the results in these case studies\nonly go to show that, despite the recent advances in computation and the increased\nawareness of phraseology in bilingual lexicography, there is still a lot to be done to\nfulfil users' needs.\nThe process of covering one part of phraseology, namely adjective-noun collocations,\nmay well be smoothed out, in both computational and lexicographical terms, with the\nmethods I put forward in Chapter 5.59\n4. Collocations and the Dictionary\nAs summarised in Hausmann (1989: 1011), the tradition of collocation dictionaries can\nbe traced back as far as the 16th century. Towards the end of the Renaissance the main\nfocus was on so-called epithets (adjectives or participles that premodify nouns); this\ntype of collocation dictionaries only came to an end with the beginning of the 20th\ncentury - when modern language lexicographers introduced a new tradition of\ncollocation dictionaries, then better named combinatorial dictionaries.\nIn 1900, Albert Heintze invented the term Stilw\u00f6rterbuch (viz. dictionary of style) for a\ngeneral monolingual dictionary with a major combinatorial component. The term was\nsoon adopted, though with a slightly different meaning, by Albrecht Reum who\npublished, inter alia, his Dictionary of English Style in 1931. Other 'early' collocation,\nviz. combinatorial, dictionaries of English include H.E. Palmer's A Grammar of English\nWords (1938), J.I. Rodale's Word Finder (1947) and Friederich and Canavan's\nDictionary of English Words in Context (1979).\nIn the following I will briefly discuss H.E. Palmer's and Friederich and Canavan's\ndictionaries - two representative early works from two different traditions.\n(DA Grammar of English Words (GEW)\nThe title of GEW suggests that this dictionary is essentially a grammar1 that lists, so the\nsubtitle, \"one thousand English words and their pronunciation, together with\ninformation concerning the several meanings of each word, its inflections and\nderivatives, and the collocations and phrases into which it enters.\" (Palmer 1938).\nAs already pointed out in Chapter 2, H.E. Palmer was an English teacher in Japan and\nhis research into vocabulary control recognised the need to focus on a core vocabulary\n1 Palmer himself said that the book might also be entitled A Grammatical Dictionary of English Words\n(1938: iii).60\nand the difficulties it presented, not so much in terms of the meaning of the words, but\nof their constructions (cf. Cowie 1999: 36).\nIn the introduction to GEW Palmer (1938: iv-v) points out that his work should fill the\ngap between traditional grammars and dictionaries2. While dictionaries at the time when\nGEW was published (viz. native-speaker monolingual ones) normally only exemplified\nthe use of uncommon or rare expressions and left usage and sentence building of\n'normal' words to grammarians, grammars only treated constructions which were of\ninterest to the grammarians themselves, elaborating on theories and merely touching on\nlexis.\nHowever, as Palmer saw it, of the 20,000 words which were in fairly current use in\nEnglish, \"about 1,000 present considerable difficulty to the foreign student of English;\nthe remainder [...] present little or no difficulty.\" (ibid: iii). Furthermore, he points out\nthat it is in connection with these 1,000 words - which form the headwords of GEW -\nthat a great majority of mistakes in grammar and composition are made, and that it is\nnot knowing about the usage of these words that prevents the learner from producing\ncorrect English in speech and writing (ibid.)\nPrincipally, Palmer (ibid: iv) suggested six categories of difficulty along which he\ndecided on inclusion in GEW:\n(1) A word belongs to more than one part of speech, e.g. for, which belongs to the\nclass of prepositions and the class of conjunctions.\n(2) A word has more than one meaning (sometimes the number is considerable), and\neach meaning may be represented with a different word in the student's mother\ntongue, e.g. to mean (Ger. beabsichtigen, meinen, bedeuten, etc.)\n(3) A word enters more than one 'sentence-pattern', e.g. wish for something, wish to\ndo something, wish somebody to do something, etc.\n(4) A word has several inflected forms and derivatives (esp. irregular ones), e.g. just\nin (injustice, justify, justification, (un)just(ly), etc.\n2 \"It has been said that there is 'a vast uncharted territory lying between the respective domains of the\ndictionary-maker and the grammarian', a sort of no-man's land in which reside the great majority of those\npoints that perplex those to whom English is a foreign language.\" (Palmer 1938: v)61\n(5) A word enters into a large number of collocations and phrases - and some of them\nagain have more than one meaning, e.g. all at once (= 'everyone at the same time'\n/ 'suddenly')\n(6) A word is a component part of another, thus forming a compound whose overall\nmeaning is sometimes not deducible from the constituents e.g. blackboard, etc.\nWhat do entries in GEW look like? Fig. 16 is a scan from GEW and exemplifies the\norganisation of the dictionary's microstructure (viz. internal organisation of the entries).\n3. ~> not busy, not occupied, at leisure\nAre you free ?\nI shall not be free until five o'clock.\nHe had no free time.\n4. -\u00bb without restraint\na free movement.\nbe free to do sg.\nYou are free to do what vou like.\n5 tree and easy5. <= cot costing anything\nThe books were given away free.\nYou need not pay\u2014It is free.\nYou may have free use of my house\nduring the summer.\nA freedom ['frirdsmj, n.

He distinguishes caption\nwords from so-called 'working units' which are specific realisations of caption words.\nThey are printed in bold and are followed by their pronunciation, their word-class label,\nand their inflected forms3, e.g. under the caption word fright(en) we find the three\nworking units frighten, fright and frightful - where each working unit stands for one\n'grammatical function'.\nGrammatical functions, which are ordered by frequency, are set out in separate\nparagraphs and are preceded by Roman numerals (I, II, etc.), while shifts of meaning\n(viz. different senses) are indicated by Arabic numerals (1, 2, etc.), e.g. fresh = 1.\n'newly produced or made or grown', 2. 'sound, clean, not spoilt', 3. 'said of the\nweather', etc.\nWhen working units are derivatives formed with regular affixes they are marked by A,\ne.g. friend\u2014 friendly \u2014friendship - unfriendly \u2014friendliness \u2014 unfriendliness.\nWhen a word (viz. working unit) forms an important element of a collocation, namely\n\"a succession of two or more words that may best be learnt as if it were a single word\"\n(Palmer 1938: x), the collocation is shown in bold type and preceded by the\nconventional sign \\ e.g. fright - \\ give somebody a fright, | take fright.\nPalmer distinguishes phrases from collocations. \"While collocations are comparable in\nmeaning and function to ordinary single 'words' (and indeed are often translated by\nsingle words in the student's mother-tongue), phrases are more in the nature of\nconversational formulas, sayings, proverbs, etc.\" (ibid: xi). Phrases are marked Phr.,\ne.g. in the entry for serve we find Phr. serve two masters.\nSquare brackets in the entries indicate alternatives, e.g. fresh flowers [eggs, bread],\nwhile round brackets enclose optional omissions, e.g. to make friends (with somebody).\n' Note that irregular inflections are printed in bold, e.g. take, takes, took, taken, taking, v.63\nPatterns into which the working units usually enter are distinguished from examples by\nletter, e.g. go from London to Birmingham vs. Where does he come from?.\nThe 'see V.P. + number' device refers to Appendix A of GEW in which the 27 most\nimportant English verb patterns can be found, e.g.:\nVerb-Pattern 1\nVerb-Pattern 4\nVerb-Pattern 19verb\nverb\nverbX\nX\nX0\ndirect object\ngerundBirds fly. 1 know.\n1 read the book.\nHe stops doing it.\nAs I already touched upon it in Chapter 2, Palmer uses the term collocation in slightly\ndifferent terms than current mainstream linguistics would do. He chose to name\ncollocation the category of any 'odd coming-together-of-words' since, in the 1930s,\ncollocation as a generic term had no settled status yet, and he refused to employ 'idiom'\nas a cover term for this category as, as he saw it, this would have meant broadening his\nscope to include also proverbs, sayings and figurative expression (cf. Cowie 1999: 54).\nIn GEW he explicitly states that \"in this book no need has been found for the term idiom\nsince what are usually called idioms are (a) collocations (b) phrases and sayings (c)\nrarer semantic varieties of words and collocations (d) peculiar construction patterns - in\nshort, any form that is likely to puzzle a foreign student.\" (Palmer 1938: xii).\nThere is yet other information to be found in GEW which is not mentioned in the user's\nguide. First, compounds, like sister ship, warship, merchant ship, shipbuilding, ship-\nowner in the entry of the caption word ship, are marked by Comp. or Comps..\nFurthermore, the use of Fig. as a label is occasionally made. However, the distinction\nbetween Phr. as in No smoke without fire, and Fig. as in Fortune has always smiled on\nhim. is not made clear.\nSummarising, let me say that GEW, although it is specialised in the sense that it only\nfocuses on the core vocabulary of English, definitely constitutes a landmark in learner\nand combinatorial lexicography, but its success was overshadowed by the publication in\n1942 of a general-purpose dictionary for foreign learners of English with rich64\nphraseology, namely A.S. Hornby, E.V. Gatenby and H. Wakefield's Idiomatic and\nSyntactic English Dictionary (ISED)4.\n(2) Dictionary of English Words in Context (DEWQ\nIn the Preface to DEWC, Wolf Friederich (1979: i) addresses once again the need for\nlearners of English to have a good command of fixed expressions and collocations:\n\"Wir wissen, da\u00df der schwierigste Baustein zusammenh\u00e4ngender Texte nicht die\nEinzelw\u00f6rter oder die Regeln der Grammatik sind, sondern die Redewendungen oder\nKollokationen - die Verbindungen, die W\u00f6rter miteinander eingehen. [...] Die\nVerbindungen, die Substantive, Verben, Adjektive und Adverbien miteinander reingehen,\nsind nicht frei, sondern liegen fest; sie unterliegen keinen Regeln oder Gesetzm\u00e4\u00dfigkeiten.\"\n(W. Friederich 1979: i)\nFriederich further states that it would have been impossible to capture the\nphraseological behaviour of the entire English lexicon, which is why they excluded\n'matter of course' combinations (viz. predictable and free combinations) as well as\narchaic and rare expressions. They also excluded words whose usages could be\nexplained in purely syntactic terms and could be looked up in A. Leonhardi and\nB.W.W. Welsh's Grammatisches W\u00f6rterbuch Englisch, (ibid.).\nHeadwords YD. DEWC are adjectives, adverbs (other than those ending in -ly), nouns and\nverbs. They are listed in alphabetical order where adjective-noun collocations can be\nfound in the noun entry and adverb-verb as well as noun-verb collocations are listed in\nthe verb entry.\nEach headword is followed by its part-of-speech label.

Monolingual Collocation Dictionaries\nMonolingual collocation dictionaries in the modern sense only came into being in the\n1980s. So, in this section I will briefly discuss existing general and specialised English\nmonolingual collocation dictionaries.66\n4.1.1. English Monolingual Collocation Dictionaries: General\nGeneral English monolingual dictionaries include Ch.D. Kozlowska and H.\nDzierzanowska's Selected English Collocations (1982/88), M. Benson et al.'s The BBI\nCombinatory Dictionary of English (1986/1997), J.McH. Sinclair's Collins COBUILD\nCollocations on CD-ROM (1995), J. Hill and M. Lewis's LTP Dictionary of Selected\nCollocations (1997) and M. Deuter et al.'s Oxford Collocations Dictionary for Students\nof English (2002).\n(I) The BBI Combinatory Dictionary of English (BBD\nAs already pointed out in Chapter 2, Morton Benson recognised the need for a\ncollocation dictionary for English learners when he was working on his Serbo-Croatian\n- English dictionary in the mid-to-late 1960s (Gabrovsek 2004: personal\ncommunication).\nSince its first publication in 1986, the BBI has been considered as THE English\ncollocation dictionary (but this reputation is now being challenged by the Oxford\nCollocation Dictionary for Students of English, which I will deal with later in this\nsection).\nThe BBI, in its 2nd edition, covers 18,000 entries and 90,000 collocations. Collocations\nin the BBI are subdivided into lexical and grammatical collocations (see Chapter 1),\nwhere lexical collocations precede grammatical ones. Some linguists (cf. Cowie 1999:\n79) claim that the BBI failed in this respect since grammatical constructions are better\nlisted in valency dictionaries, for example, than in a collocation dictionary.\nAnother reported deficiency of the BBI is the fact that although the authors explicitly\nrule out free combinations and idioms (Benson et al. 1997: xxxiv), lots of those can be\nfound in the dictionary (and they are marked with double quotation marks as such!).\nLikewise, many frequent and salient collocations have been left out (cf. Gabrovsek\n1998: 133).67\nWhat is unique to the BBI is its comprehensive user's guide (31 pages!) in which the\nauthors explain to the users how to find the collocation they need and provide detailed\ninformation on the types of collocations listed in the dictionary5.\n141 frugal\nfree hand n.

It was published in 1995 under the editorship of John\nMcH. Sinclair whose name is inseparably associated with the COBUILD project - a\npioneering dictionary project in which headwords as well as examples and collocations\nwere drawn from a corpus, now known as the Bank of English6.\nBasically, COBCOLL is a concordance program (see Chapter 2) on CD-ROM which\ncontains 10,000 nodes (= keywords that can be investigated through concordancing and\nstatistical collocation tools) that are linked with up to 20 examples per collocation from\nthe Bank of English. Altogether 140,000 collocations can be found and analysed in their\n'natural' context.\nThe user's guide makes clear that the selection of common nodes was done by a\ncomputer rather than a human being and that, therefore, odd examples could be found as\nwell as offensive ones.\nThe fact that COBOCOLL was compiled along computational lines rather than\nlexicographical or pedagogical ones, has led to constant criticism as far as the use of\nCOBCOLL as a collocation dictionary goes7. However, it is an invaluable source in\nillustrating the corpus approach to collocations.\n6 For a detailed overview of the COBUILD project see Sinclair (ed. 1987b)\n7 See Dirk Siepmann's review at: http://www.dirk-siepmann.de/Publications/Rezension Sinclaii7REVSINICL.htm.69\nWhen you open the program, you simply type in the node word you are interested in.\nWhat you can immediately see is its overall frequency.\n*\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 OpU;.-,s u\\r-.rL* w,p\nNode:\ni\niresemblance\nresearch\nresearcher\nresearchers\nj\ni\n...resemble\nresent\nresented\nresentment\nreservation\nreservations\nreserve\nreserved\nreserves\nresidence\nresident\nresidential\nresidents\nresign\nresignation\nresigned\nShow Collocate\u00ab jFieq :\n1 iOI\n38208\n1980\n8417\n1066\n906\n731\n1914\n1477\n3168\n9370\n2932\n5416\n3076El\n3950 j\u2014\n3700\n9652\n4054\n6369 i\n5462 -\n\u2014\nFig. 19a: COBCOLL - first step\nNext, you click on 'Show Collocates'.\npassing\nuncanny\nany\nmore\nstrong\nbearing\nclose\nfamily\nremarkable\nphysical61\n60\n59\n51\n40\n38\n38\n25\n24\n23\nFig. 19c: COBCOLL\n- stopwords\nFig. 19b: COBCOLL - second step70\nAs Fig 19b shows, with just the second step you can find all collocates of the node word\nin descending frequency.

Kozlowska and H. Dzierzanowska's Selected\nEnglish Collocations (1982/88) and Ch.D. Kozlowska's English Adverbial Collocations\n(1991), both of which are based on a corpus of post-1960 British English.\nLTP covers 55,000 collocations under 3,200 alphabetically listed headwords. In the\nentries collocations are subdivided into word classes. Roughly two thirds of the LTP are\ndevoted to collocations starting from a noun (2,000 headwords), while the remaining\npart is dedicated to adverbial collocations starting from a verb or adjective (1,200\nheadwords).\nThe intended user of LTP, according to the editors, is any of those well past the\nintermediate level of language learning. No glosses are provided, so the user has to have\nprior semantic knowledge about the words that make up the collocation (glosses are\nonly provided when the headword was editorially determined to have 'clearly distinct\nmeanings', e.g. talk{= 'lecture'), talks (= 'negotiations') (Cueto 1998: 1)\nA drawback of the LTP is that the collocation compilation process is not explicitly\nstated, although the authors claim to have excluded collocations that are too common,\ntoo technical, too colloquial, or too difficult. \"Included are those which are in strong\nrelation, the judgment of strength presumably resting upon the editors' expertise and\ntheir native speaker inclinations.\" (ibid: 2).72\nFOUNDATION Starling from a noun\nFOUNDATION\nV: build (on), create, destroy, establish, form, lay, make, provide, reinforce, rest on, serve as,\nshake, undermine ~\nV: - collapsed, crumbled\nA: firm, lasting, permanent, reliable, secure, shaky, solid, sound, steady, strong, weak -\nFRAMEWORK\nV: build, construct, create, destroy, erect, fit into, lay down, make, place sth in, provide, put sth\nin, set up. work within -\nA: balanced, basic, conceptual, convenient loose, proper, regular, reliable, rigid, solid, strong.\nsuitable, light -\nFRAUD\nV: accuse sb of, be guilty of, commit, convici sb of, deny, detect, discover, engage in. expose,\nperpetrate, prevent, suspect, uncover -\nA: large-scale, petty -\nFREEDOM\nV: abuse, achieve, cherish, curtail sb's. deprive sb of, desire, endanger, enjoy, ensure, fight for.\nforfeit, gain, get, give, grant, guarantee, guard, jeopardize, limit, lose, preserve, promise.\nrestore, restrict, secure, take away, threaten, value, win -\nV: - has been eroded, is at risk/in danger/threatened -\nA: absolute, academic, comparative, complete, hard-won, individual, lasting, (un)limited, new-\nfound, perfect, personal, political, relative, religious, total -\nFRICTION\nV: aggravate, avoid, cause, create, generate, give rise (o, lead to, produce, reduce, remove -\nFRIEND\nV: keep, lose, make, win ~\nA: best, close, dangerous, fair-weather, faithful, false, family, firm, good, intimate, lifelong.\nloyal, mutual, new, old, personal, school, special, sympathetic, true -\nFRIENDSHIP\nV: break off, cement, cultivate, destroy, develop, form, promote, spoil, strike up, value ~\nA: abiding, close, deep, firm, intimate, lifelong, long, personal, sentimental, unstinted, warm ~\nP: act of, bonds of, ties of, \u00bbken of -\nFRONT (defence)\nV: adopt, display, form, make, present, set up. show -\nA: common, solid, united, wide ~\nFRONTIER\nV: alter, ehange. close, create, cross, (re)define, determine, draw, establish, fix, guard, mark,\nmove, open, push back, recognise, redraw, violate -\nV: - has changed, moved, runs/stretches from ... to ...\nFRUIT\nV: bear, grow, pick ~\nA: bitter, cilru\u00ab. dried, exotic, firm, fleshy, fresh, juicy, luscious, ripe, rotten, soft, succulent.\ntinned, tropical, wild ~\nFRUSTRATION\nV; bottle up. give vent to, suffer, vent -\nA: continual, deep, great, immense, inevitable, pent-up, understandable -\nFULFILMENT\nV: achieve, bring, lead to. prevent, reach, seek, strive for -\nA: complete, immediate, instant, partial, personal, sexual, total ~\n96\nFig. 20: Sample page from LTP\n(4) Oxford Collocations Dictionary for Student* of English (OCD)\nThe OCD is the most recent achievement in collocational research and dictionary-\nmaking since it was published in 2002 and constitutes a real landmark in learners'\nlexicography in terms of both user-friendliness and comprehensiveness.\nIn contrast to the other dictionaries under discussion, the OCD is available in book form\nas well as on CD-ROM as Oxford Phrasebuilder Genie (together with the Oxford\nAdvanced Learner's Dictionary, 6th edn. [2000]).73\nOCD lists 150,000 collocations of nouns, verbs and adjectives and provides over 50,000\nexamples of collocations in context.\nHeadword bases are in bold, and where a word has different senses, each has a different\nsub-heading. Collocators8 are grouped by word classes and further grouped by the\nmeaning of the collocation in question (cf.

What the editors outline (Introduction, pp. viii-ix), though, is that three\nquestions were vital in the elaboration of their inclusion policy: (1) Is this a typical use\nof language? (2) Might a student of English want to express this idea? And (3) Would a\nstudent look up this entry to find this expression?\n! They actually use the collocate- node terminology (Deuter et al., eds. 2002: xii).74\n(5) Duden - Das Stilw\u00f6rterbuch CDUST^l\nThere is, as far as I know, no German collocation dictionary. The one work which\ncomes nearest to the general English monolingual collocation dictionaries is Wermke at\nal.'s Duden - Das Stilw\u00f6rterbuch (2001), which, however, records a variety of diverse\nword combinations, from free combinations to idioms as well as.\nFirst of all, what is a Stilw\u00f6rterbuch (cf. page 59)? Bahns (1996: 93) gives a brief\nsurvey of the history of collocation dictionaries and characterises a Stilw\u00f6rterbuch as a\nmonolingual dictionary of style that has a significant collocational component.\nThe subtitle of DUST is somewhat misleading as it reads \"Idiomatisches Deutsch -\nBedeutung und Verwendung der W\u00f6rter im Satz\", viz. \"Idiomatic German - Meanings\nand Uses of Words within Sentences\".\nFrom the foreword, however, it is clear that DUST indeed lists not only idiomatic\nexpressions but also collocations: \"Idiomatic language use does not arise from simply\nknowing what words mean in isolation, but from the knowledge of how to\n(grammatically and semantically) correctly combine them in a sentence. The\nStilw\u00f6rterbuch lists common words in German together with the combinations they can\nenter into. Furthermore, stereotyped phrases as well as sayings and proverbs are listed -\nand, therefore, the Stilw\u00f6rterbuch presents the enormous wealth of expressive power the\nGerman language has to offer\" ([translated by the author]; cf. Wermke at al., eds. 2001:\nMy analysis of DUST (Maurer-Stroh, P. 2004b) has revealed that adjective-noun\ncollocations are, in essence, listed in both types of entries, the one for the noun and the\none for the adjective.\nThis can be also seen from Fig. 22, where we can find adjective collocators in the entry\nfor the noun Freund as well as retrieve noun bases from the entry of the adjective\nfreundschaftlich.\n9 The dictionary in the Duden series 'really' concerned with idiomatic German is Volume 11, Duden -\nRedewendungen.75\n329 freundschaftlich\nschon sein F.?-.

English Monolingual Collocation Dictionaries: Specialised\nIn addition to general-purpose English monolingual collocation dictionaries, also a few\nspecialised English collocation dictionaries have been published, notably A. Spencer's\nNoun-Verb Expressions in Legal English (1975), Ch.D. Koztowska's English Adverbial76\nCollocations (1991), E.H. Mikhail's Dictionary of Appropriate Adjectives (1994) and\nB.A. Kipfer's Roget's Descriptive Word Finder - A Dictionary / Thesaurus of Adjectives\n(2003).\n(1) Noun-Verb Expressions in Legal English (NVELE)\nOnly few people seem to have ever seen Arnold Spencer's innovative work (Gabrovsek\n2004: private communication), so I have to base my comments and the sample page in\nFig. 23 on A.P. Cowie's (1985) survey of collocation dictionaries.\nVerb EVIDENCE\nA B C \u2014-D\n(CONSIDEB ...) (SET DOWJ ...) (GIVE ...) (... BE ENOUGH)\n: A (CONSIDER ...)\n1. accept evidence\nIn such cases the coroner may accept hearsay evidence.\n2. admit evidence\nFailure to Inform him will deprive the court of its ability to\nrefuse to admit alibi evidence*\n3. hear evidence\nThe evidence of the remaining witnesses will be heard tomorrow.\n1. : B (SET DOWN ...)\nrecord evidence\nThe evidence was duly recorded in writing.\n: C (CIVE ...)\nI. adduce evidence\nThe burden of adducing evidence of duress is borne by the accused.\n2- give evidence\nSo person giving evidence in such an Investigation shall be required\nto sign his evidence.\n3. lead evidence\n: They should lead evidence during their own case and not waitto call\nevidence in rebuttal.\n*\u2022 produce evidence\nBe produced evidence of his wife's infidelity.\n(Spencer, 1975)\nFig. 23: Sample from NVELE77\nSpencer's approach is to specify a number of 'core' verb meanings which are\ncompatible with the noun evidence. They are set out as keywords (rough translations of\nthe Arabic words) in a simple diagram at the head of the entry. The selected keyword\nleads the user on to a set of verbs (Cowie 1985: 67-68).\nAccording to Cowie, this is the most original and effective arrangement, though not the\nmost economical one; for this reason, it is only suitable for ESP glossaries with limited\nword coverage (ibid.).\n(2) Dictionary of Appropriate Adjectives (DAA)\nE.H. Mikhail's DAA lists some 4,000 nouns (in alphabetical order) and provides in 342\npages10 numerous adjectives (arranged in thematic sequences) that are used to describe\nthem.\nAccording to what is stated on the back cover and in the Preface, the DAA will help you\n(1) find a specific adjective to describe a noun, e.g. a guttural consonant, a temporal\nruler, (2) make an exact technical description of a noun; an arch, for example, could be\ndescribed by a variety of adjectives, such as vaulted, scalloped, corbelled or elliptical,\n(3) discover a suitable classical or mythological label, e.g. a Cadmean victory, Orphic\nmystery, Spartan endurance and (4) find the appropriate adjective that applies to a\ncertain animal, e.g. cooing pigeon, hissing snake.\nThe DAA is essentially an adjective-noun dictionary which does not only include\ncollocational information of this particular structural type but also list technical terms\nand archaic, stilted and technical expressions which serve for creative writing more than\nas a collocational aid for foreign learners of English.\nOnly words that are listed in standard-language dictionaries as adjectives are included in\nthis dictionary, so, all other formally / etymologically related forms, e.g. participles\nending in -ed or -ing, are excluded. Also included are nouns used idiomatically as\nadjectives, e.g. crocodile tears. These 'adjectives' are listed at the end of the entry\n10 Included in the 342 pages are three appendices: (A) Good Personal Qualities (pp. 333-34), (B) Bad\nPersonal Qualities (pp. 335-37) and (C) Similes with Adjectives (338-42).78\ntogether with technical adjectives. A user looking for an adjective to describe less\ncommon nouns should look for it under more common ones, e.g. for boutique see shop,\netc. (Mikhail 1994: vii).\nfrankness refreshing, bracing, disarming,\nbreathtaking, surprising, astonishing,\nastounding, amazing, unusual, blunt, utter,\nsincere, warm, taut, evident, remarkable,\nobsessive, acid, brutal, na\u00efve\nfraud, frauds deliberate, callous, blatant,\nbarefaced, outright, gross, absolute,\nextreme, all-out, gigantic, unqualified,\nunmitigated, widespread, rampant, actual,\napparent, constructive, electoral, criminal\nfreedom, freedoms flowering,\nunencumbered, real, perilous,\n(ir)responsible, giddy, gypsy, rascally,\nuntrammelled, new-found, (hard-)won,\nelusive, short-lived, lost, basic,\nfundamental, relative, comparative,\nlimitless, (un)limited, partial, total,\nabsolute, moral, religious, political,\nacademic, intellectual\nfrequency, frequencies startling,\nastounding, astonishing, amazing, growing,\nrising, increasing, alarming, frightening,\nmaddening, significant, common, habitual,\npersistent, nightmarish; low, reduced,\nmedium, high, radio, angular, base, audio\nfreshness delicious, dewy, crisp, vivid,\nyouthful, vernal, open-air\nfriend, friends intimate, beloved, bosom,\nclose, well-matched, congenial, firm,\ndelightful, affectionate, constant, loyal,\nstaunch, (stead)fast, attached, lifelong,\nstalwart, steady, inseparable, sincere,\nloving, trusty, devoted, dear, constant,\nwarm, faithful, unfailing, tender,\n(e)special, exceptional, sympathetic, near,\n(much-)valued, valuable, favoured, select,\nparticular, unsycophantic, like-minded,\nreassuring, familiar, candid, judicious,\nlevel-headed, (unreliable, (in)considerate,\nhonest, hospitable, influential, powerful,\nhigh-powered, high-profile, high-placed,\nwell-placed, posh, illustrious, useful,\nformer, (long-)lost, quondam, erstwhile,\nlong-ago, long-time, old-time, one-time,\nsometime, unworthy, false, so-called,\ndubious, fair-weather, deceitful,\ntreacherous, faithless, perfidious,\ndisloyal, unfaithful, officious, personal,\nchildhood, school, college, mutual,\npolitical\nFig. 24: Sample entries from DAA79\nCi) Roget's Descriptive Word Finder - A Dictionary / Thesaurus of Adjectives (RDWF)\nAnother specialised dictionary devoted to adjectives is Barbara Ann Kipfer's RDWF. It\nis a combination of a dictionary and a thesaurus listing in 457 pages both common and\nunfamiliar adjectives to add nuance and originality to your piece of writing. (Kipfer\n2003: back cover).\nIn RDWF adjectives are organised by theme, bringing related words together under\nspecific (572!) category headings.\nKipfer, as she herself states (2003: 1), included every adjective described in other\npublications about adjectives, e.g. print dictionaries, dictionaries of descriptive terms,\nthematic dictionaries and dictionaries of obscure words.\nRDWF is NOT a collocation dictionary (although some collocations might have found\ntheir way into it), and Kipfer herself suggests the users employ other dictionaries for\ncontext clarification:\n\"Whenever in doubt of for further clarification, do consult an authoritative college or\nunabridged print dictionary. Sometimes the user will need a more detailed definition to be\nsure that the chosen word is correct for the intended context.\"\n(B.A. Kipfer 2003: 1)\nPerfume\nambrosial: divinely fragrant\nantibromic deodorant\naromatic: having a pleasing scent or\nodor\nbalmy: fragrant like aromatic bairn\neuodic aromatic\nfragrant: having a sweet or pleasing\nodor\nlibanophorous: scented; producing\nincense\nmuscadine: having the fragrance of the\nSouthern fox grape\nolenu fragrant; having an odor\nperfumatory: yielding a pleasant odor\nperfumed: sweet-scentedredolent: diffusing a pervasive odor;\nfragrant\nrose: sweetly scented like a rose\nrosewatered: delicate; sentimental;\nperfumed\nsavory: agreeable in smell; especially\nfragrant\nscented: smelling\nspicy: having a pungent odor\nsuaveolent: sweet-smelling\nsweet: fragrant, perfumed, or fresh to At\nsmell\nsweet-scented: pleasing to the smell\nsweet-smelling: pleasing to the smell\nAuriferous: producing or bearing\nfrankincense\nFig. 25: Sample category from RDWF80\nI included RDWF in this survey of collocation dictionaries since my primary concern is\nadjectives preceding nouns and, as I see it, any dictionary having to do with adjectives\nis in essence a combinatorial one - and it definitely is of relevance in a thesis on how to\ncreate an adjective-noun collocation dictionary.\n4.2. Bilingual Collocation Dictionaries\nBilingual collocation dictionaries, both specialised and general, of any two languages\nare very rare. The ones I am aware of are W. Weng-chang's A Dictionary of English\nCollocations (1990)11, M. Benson and E. Benson's Russian-English Dictionary of\nVerbal Collocations (1993), S. Ichikawa et al.'s The Kenkyusha Dictionary of English\nCollocations (1995)12 and L. Iordanskaja and S. Papemo's A Russian-English\nCollocational Dictionary of the Human Body (1996) (cf. section 2.2.4),\n(1) A Dictionary ofEnslish Collocations (DEC)\nDEC is another dictionary I have never held in my hands; however, a review by C.-Y.\nTsai (1997) provides the necessary data for a brief outline of this bilingual English-\nChinese collocation dictionary intended for students of English as a foreign language.\nDEC is a product of a team of 20 faculty members (English Department) at Suzhow\nUniversity, China, and is based on the (English-Japanese) A New Dictionary of English\nCollocations edited by S. Katsumata in 1958. It comprises 15,000 entries and 300,000\ncollocational examples. In addition to the main dictionary part, DEC also includes a list\nof compounds (pp. 1861-1928).\nThe fact that DEC not only includes closed collocations, but also open ones, viz. free\ncombinations in the Bensonian sense, suggests why it is considerably bigger than the\nBBI (with 90,000collocations) - which is not true when we compare the number of\nentries, i.e. 14,000 vs. 15,000.\n11 This is an English-Chinese collocation dictionary.\n12 English-Japanese.81\nmeddle, o.\nM m*ddU too much\nr m\u00eaddU in everything \u2014/t^lW<&.

While the\nolder edition lists 200,000 examples, KDEC comprises 380,000 collocations (Tsai 2000:\n205).\nAccording to Tsai compilation methods changed in the new version since a corpus was\nused for the revision, but some of the old problems still linger in this new edition, the\nmost conspicuous of which is the inclusion of free combinations. Furthermore, there are\nstill misplacements of collocators in the new edition, e.g. apply Jor a patent in the entry\nfor patent (ibid: 207).\nAnother shortcoming of KDEC is that different senses of the headwords are separated\nby semicolons only, and users would have to browse through long entries while being\nvery careful to get the information they need (ibid.).\nTo conclude the review, Tsai observes that using a corpus in the compilation of a\ncollocation dictionary does not guarantee that the dictionary is useful (cf. COBCOLL, p.\n68).\nfamily \u00ab.

Each entry in the dictionary\ncontains a section entitled 'Lexical Relationships' and the headings and sub-headings under this rubric\nrepresent lexical functions (or their classes), viz. Mel'cuk's oriented lexical relationships (cf. p. 19).85\nEach entry consists of sections on semantics, morphology, syntax, lexical relationships\nand sample texts. The section on lexical relationships (see Fig. 29)15 is the one\ncontaining collocations: \"They are grouped together semantically under various\nheadings, often with further subdivisions: one group consists of expressions describing\nthe appearance of the body part, another is devoted to sensations, another to\nmovements, etc.\" (Iordanskaja and Paperno 199616). RECDHB is available online, in\nCD-ROM format and in printed form.\nThere are yet another two bilingual collocation dictionaries which are conspicuous by\ntheir absence both on the internet and in western libraries. Benson et al. (1997: vii)\nexplicitly state among their sources for the revised edition of the BBI two bilingual\nversions of the BBI, namely the Maruzen edition (Tokyo, 1993) and the Longman\nDictionary of English Collocations (Hong Kong, 1995).\n4.2.1. Collocation Dictionaries of English and German\nThere are indeed two collocation dictionaries of English and German available, H.\nBogatz's The Advanced Reader's Collocation Searcher (1997) and D. Siepmann's\nAdvanced Learner's Trilingual Lexicon. Dictionnaire th\u00e9matique anglais-fran\u00e7ais-\nallemand. Politique-Economie-Expression du temps et de la quantification (1997).\nWhile Bogatz's dictionary is only available in CD-ROM format and merely translates\nthe headword bases into German, Siepmann's work is actually trilingual and covers\nonly a very specialised area, namely politics and economy.\n(1) The Advanced Reader's Collocation Searcher (ARCS)\nARCS, as Horst Bogatz describes it17, is an electronic word combination searcher. So,\nlike COBCOLL it only comes as a CD-ROM version. ARCS is primarily an English\n151 deliberately left out the Russian side here since my browser does not support the Russian orthography.\n16 See the online version at http://russian.dmll.comell.edu/russian.web/BODY/WIN 1251/INDEX.HTM [10/10/2004].\n17 See his homepage at: http://www.qeocities.com/Athens/AcroDolis/7033/ [7/12/2004]86\nmonolingual collocation dictionary in as much as it lists English node words and\ncollocates and provides the German translation of the headwords only.\nWithin its electronic format ARCS covers more than 40,700 nodes which are linked with\ntheir collocates to roughly 1.4 million examples; moreover, ARCS can be searched\nglobally starting from either the English headword (adjective, noun, adverb, verb) or the\nGerman translation. This search facility indeed makes ARCS a useful tool for learners of\nEnglish. However, the learner has to have prior semantic knowledge of the English\ncombinations since no glosses (or translations) are provided for the meaning of the\ncollocations.\naskSam - [arcsda!2O02.ask]\njj?)

Politique-Economie-Expression du temps et de la quantification (ALTD)\nDirk Siepmann's ALTD is a trilingual (print) dictionary of English, German and French\nand its intended target groups are post-intermediate learners of any of the three\nlanguages as well as translators, interpreters and people from political, economic and\nsociology backgrounds.\nALTD is based on a specialised corpus of political and economic texts running into\nmillions of words - and it is this corpus-based approach that made it possible to focus\non useful word combinations. Further, it is organised into three chapters: (1) politics, (2)\neconomics and the environment and (3) time and quantification. These chapters are\nfurther divided into sections, i.e. the vocabulary in ALTD is categorised by topics, e.g.\nThe Executive Power, Banking, etc18.\nExcerpt from the chapter on conflict:\npeople's dissatisfaction/\ndisgruntlement (with)\ngeneral dissatisfaction\nsocial discontent / dissatisfaction\nmounting frustxation(s) // tension\naccumulated despair\ninner rage\npent-up violence\nan outpouring of discontent\nto create great dissatisfaction\nto voice one's dissatisfaction\nto air one's grievances (against)\nto deepen dissatisfaction\nthe general unre st in the town\na flammable // tense situation\na divided/sundered nation/\nsociety\na nation split between the rich and\nthe poor\nthe social fabric is being torn\napart\nsocial divisions\na fractured country\nto sharpen class divisions\na crippled / paralysed societyle m\u00e9contentement populaire /des\nmasses (de)\nun ras-le-bol g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\nle m\u00e9contentement / malaise\nsocial // la grogne des masses\ndes frustrations // tensions\ncroissantes\nl'accumulation de d\u00e9sespoir\nla col\u00e8re int\u00e9rieure\nla violence int\u00e9rieure\nun flot de m\u00e9contentement\nsusciter un s\u00e9rieux\ninecurneriLerrieni\nexprimerson m\u00e9contentement\nmanifester/ exposer ses griefs //\nexprimer ses dol\u00e9ances (\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard\nrta\\ae)\naggraver le m\u00e9contentementle bouillon g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui agite la ville\nune situation explosive //tendue\nune nation divis\u00e9e // soci\u00e9t\u00e9\n\u00e9clat\u00e9e\nune nation divis\u00e9e entre les riches\net les pauvres\nle tissu social se d\u00e9chire/se d\u00e9lite\nla fracture sociale\nun pays coup\u00e9 en deux\naggraver les divisions sociales\nune soci\u00e9t\u00e9 bloqu\u00e9e / paralys\u00e9e /\nen pannedie Unzufriedenheit in der\n\u00d6ffentlichkeit (mit)\neine allgemeine\n(Staats-)Verd rossen h eit\ndersoziale Unmut\nwachsende Fmstration(en) //\nSpannungen)\ndie aufgestaute Verzweiflung\ndie Innere Wut\ndie aufgestaute Gewalt\neine Welle der Unzufriedenheit/\nKlagewelle\nstarken Unmut ausl\u00f6sen\nseinen Unmut zum Ausdruck\nbringen\nseinen Klagen Luft machen (\u00fcber}\ndie Unzufriedenheit verst\u00e4rken\ndie allgemeine Unruhe in der Stadt\neine explosive//angespannte\nSituation\neine geteilte Nation / gespaltene\nGesellschaft\neine in Arm(e) und Reich(e)\ngespaltene Nation\ndas Sozialgef\u00fcge bricht\nauseinander\nder Bruch in der Gesellschaft\nein gespaltenes Land\ndie Klassengegens\u00e4tze\nversch\u00e4rfen\neine gel\u00e4hmte Gesellschaft\nFig. 31 : Extract from ALTD\n18 For further details see Siepmann's homepage at httD://www,dirk-sieDmann.de/Publications/publications,html\n[7/12/2004]88\nIt is interesting to note that the number of monolingual and bilingual collocation\ndictionaries, both general and specialised, is rather small when compared to the huge\nnumber of dictionaries of idioms or proverbs available almost all over the world.\n4.2.2. Proposals for Bilingual Collocation Dictionaries\nAs far as I am aware, there are only two proposals for specific bilingual collocation\ndictionaries actually formulated. These are A.F. Abu-Ssaydeh's suggestion for an\nArabic English collocation dictionary (1995) and D. Gabrovsek's proposal for an\ninterlingual collocation dictionary of English and Slovene (1998a).\nD. Gabrovsek considers 12 factors which should be taken into account when creating a\nbilingual collocation dictionary (Gabrovsek 1998a: 137-138):\n(1) A bilingual collocation dictionary is essentially a dictionary for encoding, viz.\ntext production.\n(2) The intended user groups are advanced language learners as well as translators,\nespecially for the written mode since, here, mother-tongue interference problems\nare much more likely to occur (i.e. when the translator sees his or her LI\ncollocation and simply translates the collocation word-by-word into the L2) than\nin spontaneous speech.\n(3) Slovene collocations are placed on the left-hand side - where Slovene users\nwould typically start, while the English equivalents are to be found on the right-\nhand side.\n(4) The inclusion policy should be based upon contrastive considerations, i.e.\nincluded should be collocations that do not readily translate into English.\n(5) Headwords should be for bases since it is normally the base from which users\nstart looking at collocations - in text production. Furthermore, collocators could\nbe listed as an index in the back matter, with cross-references to the base entries\nin the main part.\n(6) In the base entries, collocators should be group according to a clear scheme that\nhas to be explained in the front matter, i.e. user's guide.89\n(7) Borderline cases should be included.\n(8) Collocations should be illustrated in brief passages rather than lengthy examples.\n(9) The starting point for the organisation of the dictionary should be the user's\nmother tongue.\n(10) Headword lists can draw upon existing dictionaries.\n(11) The dictionary should illustrate the lexicographer's awareness of the open-\nchoice vs. idiom principle dichotomy.\n(12) The compilation of the dictionary should involve active participation of both\nEnglish and Slovene native speakers.\nA.F. Abu-Ssaydeh started to compile data for his Arabic-English dictionary in the late\n1980s; however, this process of compilation later encountered various obstacles - which\nis why the production of the dictionary has been delayed for an indefinite period (Abu-\nSsaydeh 1995: 12).\nIn contrast to all the other collocation dictionaries I discussed so far, Abu-Ssaydeh's\nArabic-English Collocation Dictionary would be the only one to include not only\nlexical and grammatical collocations but also idioms, such as to have one's back to the\nwall. Furthermore, he took a personal interest in synonymous and near-synonymous\ncollocations, such as bidayaa - dawn (of an age, civilization, hope, love), inception (of a\nproject), onset (offever, winter), outset (of a career). However, this feature in particular\nproved very tricky in the compilation process (ibid: 17).\nFrom the organisational point of view, the Arabic-English Collocation Dictionary lists\nArabic nouns as headwords. These are followed by an explanation of their meanings in\nboth English and Arabic. Then, verbs and adjectives as well as prepositions that go with\nthe headword noun are listed. Finally, idioms and idiosyncratic combinations are\nentered. If different verb and adjective collocators are synonyms or near-synonyms,\ntheir distribution is given in English (see paragraph above) (ibid: 20-21)\nAs the main source of data for the Arabic-English Collocation Dictionary Abu-Ssaydeh\nused English monolingual dictionaries as well as English-Arabic dictionaries, the BBI,\nRodale's Word Finder and Cowie et al.'s Oxford Dictionary of Current Idiomatic\nEnglish.90\nHaving outlined collocation dictionaries in the monolingual and the bilingual\nframework, I now turn to a discussion of bilingual lexicography in more detail - in\norder to form the basis for a sound methodology of the compilation of a bilingual\nadjective-noun collocation dictionary of English and German.\n4.3. Bilingual Lexicography with a Special Focus on English and\nGerman\nOur knowledge of the history of bilingual lexicography - and German-English\nlexicography in particular - is mainly based on the work of Hans-Peder Kromann, Theis\nRiiber, Poul Rosbach; Gabriele Stein; Franz Josef Hausmann and Margaret Cop\n(Kromann, Riiber and Rosbach 1991, Stein 1985 and Hausmann and Cop 1985).\nThe first language reference works with a Germanic component which can be compared\nto modern bilingual dictionaries date back to the 8th century. These so-called glossaries\nexplained Latin words for 'English' speakers.\nThe earliest 'genuine' bilingual dictionary, a Latin-English one, originated in the 15th\ncentury, while the first English-German dictionary appeared only in 1706. The first\nGerman-English dictionary was published in 1716. Both dictionaries were compiled by\nChristian Ludwig (see Stein 1985 and Hausmann and Cop 1985 for a detailed account\nof the history of English-German lexicography).\n4.3.1. Principles of Bilingual Lexicography\nBilingual dictionary compilation, according to Kromann, Riiber and Rosbach (1991:\n2713-14), should include consideration of three vital aspects, namely the user aspect,\nthe linguistic aspect and the empirical aspect.\nThe user aspect is concerned with WHO will be the user of the dictionary. The\nlinguistic aspect focuses on WHAT kind of relations will be dealt with, i.e. equivalence91\nrelations as well as relations on both the paradigmatic and the syntagmatic axes, etc.\nFinally, the empirical aspect unites the former two in order to tell the lexicographer\nHOW to establish relevant corpora and other material and best retrieve the information\nfrom them (in the light of the requirements set out by the analysis of both the user and\nthe linguistic aspects).\n(1) The User Aspect\nIt was the L.V. Shcherba who first identified and reported on the important point of the\nuser aspect resulting from his (and Matusevich's) work on a Russian-French dictionary\nin 1936. His famous work, first published in Russian in 1940, was not translated into\nEnglish until 1995 (Farina 1995)19. In a nutshell, he arrived at the conclusion that one\nhas to distinguish between translation, and therefore dictionaries, from the native\nlanguage into a foreign language on the one hand, and translation from a foreign\nlanguage into one's native language on the other. Keeping in mind that the creation of a\nbilingual dictionary actually involves two language pairs, thus, two different target\ngroups, this results in the need for four distinct dictionaries when compiling a single\nbilingual reference work. In the words of Smolik (1969 [as quoted by Kromann et al.\n1991]), who used the terms active vs. passive dictionary, for English and German\nspeakers these are:\n(a)\n1.\n2.\n(b)\n1.\n2.For German speakers\nactive dictionary\npassive dictionary\nFor English speakers\nactive dictionary\npassive dictionary= translation\n= translation\n= translation\n= translationfrom\nfrom\nfrom\nfromGerman\nEnglish\nEnglish\nGermaninto English\ninto German\ninto German\ninto English('encoding')\n('decoding')\n('encoding')\n('decoding')\nFig. 32: Active vs. passive dictionaries\n19 Originally published in Russian as \"Oypt obshchei teorii leksikografii\" in the Journal of the Soviet\nAcademy of Sciences, Izvestiia Akademii Nauk SSSR, Otdelenie literatury i iazyka, 1940, No. 3: 89-11792\nMore methodically than Shcherba and Smolik, Williams (1959) had called attention to\nthe functions along which bilingual dictionaries can be classified. Bilingual dictionaries\ncan be either mono-functional, i.e. decoding OR encoding for only one language group,\nor bi-functional, which means that the bilingual dictionary is intended to be used by a\ntarget group both in encoding AND decoding. Likewise, a bi-directional (= two-way)\nand bi-functional dictionary would serve two language groups in both decoding and\nencoding.\nTo put it differently and perhaps more accurately, general-purpose bilingual dictionaries\nof German and English can (or should) have two functions, and two directions\nrespectively, as regards the user aspect:\nFunction 1: ENCODING\ndirection 1 = English - German (for English native speakers)\ndirection 2 = German - English (for German native speakers)\nFunction 2: DECODING\ndirection 1 = English - German (for German native speakers)\ndirection 2 = German - English (for English native speakers)\nFig. 33: Bi-directional and bi-fiinctional dictionaries\nIn practical lexicographical terms encoding means that the users look up lexical items in\ntheir native language in order to get foreign-language equivalents. Consequently, meta-\nlexicographical information such as style labels and sense discriminators should be\ngiven in the users' LI20.\nOn the other hand, decoding suggests that unfamiliar foreign words are listed and\nexplained in the users' mother tongue. Here, users start from the L2.\n20 Williams (1959: 251, as quoted in Kroman et al. 1991: 2715) argued that for the purpose of a bi-\ndirectional and bi-functional dictionary sense discriminators should be introduced for both languages, but\nhe also admitted that that solution would not be realistic in the light of the space constraint in the print\ndictionaries - a problem which could be overcome with recent electronic versions of bilingual\ndictionaries, e.g. PC-Bibliothek on CD-ROM.93\nIn my opinion, Shcherba's typology definitely constitutes a considerable advance in\nterms of user-friendliness and lexicographical practice; however, there were still\nlexicographers trying to take this typology of four \"implicit\" dictionaries even further.\nZgusta et al. (1971: 299-300), for example, put forward the consideration of the\ndimension of 'purpose'. In this context, 'purpose' refers to whether the bilingual\ndictionary is addressed to the public, i.e. general translation, or whether it is intended\nfor use in literary translation, business contracts, etc.\nSimilarly, Hausmann (1988: 138-39) is not convinced either of the four-part typology.\nFor him, EACH language group ought to have four dictionaries; consequently, each\nlanguage pair should cover as many as eight dictionaries:\nFunction 1: ENCODING\ndirection 1 = English - German (for English native speakers)\n=> L2 TEXT PRODUCTION\n= English - German (for English native speakers)\n=> TRANSLATION INTO L2\ndirection 2 = German - English (for German native speakers)\n=> L2 TEXT PRODUCTION\n= German - English (for German native speakers)\n=> TRANSLATION INTO L2\nFunction 2: DECODING\ndirection 1 = English - German (for German native speakers)\n=> L2 COMPREHENSION\n= English - German (for German native speakers)\n=> TRANSLATION INTO L1\ndirection 2 = German - English (for English native speakers)\n=> L2 COMPREHENSION\n= German - English (for English native speakers)\n=> TRANSLATION INTO L1\nFig. 34: Hausmann's typology of bilingual dictionaries94\nFurther angles of the user aspect include recent studies of user sociology of the type\n\"How and why do users consult dictionaries?\". Sue Atkins and Krista Varantola\nconducted such a survey which also comprised a section on bilingual dictionary use\n(Atkins and Varantola 1998: 111-14)21. Their results22 revealed that out of 1,000 look-\nups 71% were done in bilingual dictionaries while only 28% of the look-ups were\nobserved in L2 monolingual dictionaries.\nInterestingly, the percentages of the bilingual look-ups for an L1-L2 word translation do\nnot vary considerably from the percentage of look-ups for an L2-L1 translation,\nalthough, naturally, L1-L2 translation, viz. encoding, is in the lead (L1-L2 = 72% vs.\nL2-L1 = 63%).\nHowever, when the subjects were given an L1-L2 collocation task, only 40% used a\nbilingual dictionary while 60% consulted an L2 monolingual dictionary. However, it\nbecame clear that users started from bilingual dictionaries and only later turned to\nmonolingual ones. Some users even went back to bilingual dictionary consultation after\nthe monolingual look-up, either because they thought they must have missed something\nin the previous bilingual look-up or because they needed reassurance. It is especially\nthis finding that was the most striking for Atkins and Varantola, \"the amount of\nreassurance sought from [the] dictionaries, particularly about L2 collocation, by even\nthe most skilled non-native speakers, however experienced in translation they may be\"\n(ibid: 115).\nSummarising the discussion of the user aspect, let me point out that my adjective-noun\ncollocation dictionary is, in essence, a mono-functional English-to-German encoding\ndictionary. However, as I see it, a dictionary of this kind might also be used as a\ndecoding help for German speakers, especially during a translation task when the\nGerman translator might be 'too immersed in the English language' to quickly find the\ncorrect LI equivalent of the collocation in question.\n21 For another survey on user aspects as regards bilingual lexicography in general see Hartmann (1987).\nResearch on collocations and dictionary use will be dealt with in section 4.3.2.\n22 They tested their methodology on 71 participants in 15 different language communities at the\nEURALEX Workshop on Dictionary Use held in Oxford in 1991.95\nFurthermore, an index of German nouns in the back matter of the dictionary could help\nboth English decoding users as well as German encoding users. Let me illustrate this\nwith a sample entry from my dictionary (Fig. 35):\nsample\nbiased verzerrte Stichprobe / Auswahl | clinical\nklinische Stichprobe | free unverk\u00e4ufliches Muster |\nlarge gro\u00dfe Auswahl | representative repr\u00e4sentative\nAuswahl, repr\u00e4sentatives Beispiel | small kleine\nAuswahl\n\u2022 to have a blood sample taken Blut abgenommen\nbekommen\n\u2022 blood sample Blutprobe f\n(the) taking of a blood sample Blutentnahme f\ncommercial sample [Warenmuster n\nfaecal sample Kotprobe f\nfree sample Gratismuster n, Gratisprobe f\nrandom sample Stichprobe f\nrock sample Gesteinsprobe f\ntissue sample (MED) Gewebeprobe f\nurine sample Hamprobe f, Urinprobe f\nFig. 35: The entry for sample in the English-German adjective-noun collocation dictionary\nThe English user encoding into German finds adjective collocators in the entry for\nsample. The collocators are listed in alphabetical order right after the headword, e.g.\nbiased sample = verzerrte Stichprobe. These are followed by a section on English\nadjective-noun collocations whose German translations do not reflect the adjective +\nnoun structure, e.g. to have a blood sample taken = Blut abgenommen bekommen (noun\n+ verbal passive structure). In the subsequent section, the English user finds adjective-\nnoun collocations that are rendered into German as 'authentic' compounds, i.e. spelled\nas one word, or German single words, e.g. blood sample = Blutprobe (Blut + Probe) or\ncommercial sample = Muster.\nFrom the grammatical information provided in Fig. 35 we can see that this is indeed an\nentry intended for English users rather than German ones since each German compound\ncomes with its grammatical gender (which a German user would not need)23.\n23 On the other hand, they would not disturb German users in a German-English dictionary, and there is\nno such thing as grammatical gender in English anyway.96\nFurthermore, in the adjective-noun section, the adjective collocators are listed in their\ninflected form relative to the German noun.\nThe reason why the noun is listed in the German translation is that some English nouns,\naccording to their senses, can be rendered into German with different nouns, e.g. free\nsample = unverk\u00e4ufliches Muster vs. large sample = gro\u00dfe Auswahl.\nThe index in the back matter created from the entry in Fig. 35 and the entry for\ntendency24 would look like this:\nGERMAN NOUN\nAngewohnheit\nAuswahl\nBeispiel\nBlut\nBlutentnahme\nBlutprobe\nDrang\nGesteinsprobe\nGewebeprobe\nGratismuster\nGratisprobe\nHang\nHarnprobe\nKotprobe\nLinksdrall\nM\u00f6rder\nMuster\nNeigung, -en\nRechtsdrall\nStichprobe\nTendenz, -en\nTrend\nUrinprobe\nVeranlagung\nWarenmusterENGLISH ENTRY\ntendency\nsample\nsample\nsample\nsample\nsample\ntendency\nsample\nsample\nsample\nsample\ntendency\nsample\nsample\ntendency\ntendency\nsample\ntendency\ntendency\nsample\ntendency\ntendency\nsample\ntendency\nsample\nFig. 36: Sample index of the adjective-noun collocation dictionary\nAn index like the one in Fig. 36 can be used by both an English user decoding from\nGerman into English and a German user encoding into English - all it takes is a double\nlook-up.\n24 For illustrative purposes I added the index for tendency here as well.97\nIn an electronic version of the English-German adjective-noun collocation dictionary,\nqueries would be possible not only starting from English and German nouns but also\nstarting from English and German adjectives as well as collocations proper. So, the\nquery for free sample would result in unverk\u00e4ufliches Muster / Gratismuster /\nGratisprobe and searches for both repr\u00e4sentatives Beispiel and repr\u00e4sentative Auswahl\nwould list representative sample.\n(2) The Linguistic Aspect\nCentral to the linguistic aspect of bilingual lexicography is the notion of equivalence\nwhich I have dealt with in Chapter 3 (Contrastivity), already, but which I will discuss\nin more detail in section 4.3.2.\nFurther to equivalence, the linguistic aspect also covers issues like the degree of\nspecialisation of the dictionary. This, in turn, slightly overlaps with the user aspect\ninsofar as the specialisation definitely determines the target group25.\nFor the purpose of this thesis I chose only English adjective-noun or noun-noun\ncollocations to be considered for inclusion in the bilingual collocation dictionary. I base\nmy decision on the following factors:\n(1) Adjective-noun / noun-noun collocations are, together with verb-noun/noun-\nverb collocations, commonest types of lexical collocations. It is true that both\ntypes can be semantically unpredictable and, thus, can cause difficulties in\nencoding; however, adjective-noun collocations and nominal collocations are far\nmore often subject to structural incongruence, viz. variation on the syntagmatic\nlevel, than are verbal collocations (at least in the English-German direction), e.g.\nhomicidal tendency = Drang zum T\u00f6ten (lit. trans, tendency towards homicide)\nwhich is a nominal phrase \"turned\" into the noun Drang and a post-modifying\nprepositional phrase zum T\u00f6ten vs. to commit suicide = Selbstmord begehen\n(noun + verb). As I see it, difficulties in encoding begin with structural\n25 The target user groups in my case are advanced English-speaking learners of German who have\nreached creative-writing level as well as English-German translators who might run the risk of relying too\nmuch on the hypothesis of transferability (cf. I.2.).98\nincongruence and then increase in semantic unpredictability26, e.g. [this is] a\nfeeble / misleading /poor comparison = der Vergleich hinkt [noun + verb] (lit.\ntrans, the comparison walks with a limp).\n(2) The fact that some English noun-noun combinations are regarded as compounds\nwhile others are lexicographically categorised as free combinations or\ncollocations also makes topical the idea of an adjective-noun collocation\ndictionary. Naturally, combinations of nouns pre-modifying nouns have to be\nincluded in the collocation dictionary when they are not classified into the group\nof compounds or are free combinations. Chapter 5 will address this in more\ndetail.\n(3) Yet another factor for choosing the adjective-noun structure was that it is easy to\ncompare along different approaches, e.g. simple corpus linguistic vs.\ncomputational approaches, since in both German and English adjectives\nnormally immediately precede the nouns they modify.\n(3) The Empirical Aspect\nOne of the major drawbacks bilingual dictionaries suffer from is their taking over\ninventories of entries from monolingual dictionaries - and merely translating them\n(Rromann, Riiber, Rosbach 1991: 2714). However, assessing collocations in the\nbilingual framework is a lot different from dealing with collocations from the\nmonolingual point of view (cf. Gabrovsek 1998) - as we have seen already in Chapters\n1 and 3.\nBilingual dictionary compilation has improved a lot over the last few decades; e.g.\nAtkins (1994) pioneered the use of two (comparable) monolingual electronic corpora as\nthe reference for the compilation of the Oxford-Hachette (Corr\u00e9ard and Grundy eds.\n1994). As far as I know, Collins German (Terrell et al. eds. 1999) and the two-volume\nEnglish-Slovene Oxford veliki anglesko slovenski slovar [forthcoming 2005-06] are the\nonly dictionaries compiled along these lines.\n26 cf. Chapter 399\nUsing corpora in the dictionary compilation process means that what is displayed in the\ndictionary is not only the introspection of a team of lexicographers , but also actual\nlanguage in use. It is true, as John Sinclair stated, that \"language cannot be invented; it\ncan only be captured\" (Sinclair 1997: 31).\nSome of the recent studies in contrastive phraseology highlight the use of parallel\ncorpora, i.e. texts and their translations, from which one can easily extract multi-word\nunits and their translation equivalents. For brief surveys see Maurer-Stroh (2003) and\nFliedl et al. (2004)27. The drawbacks of this method lie, inter alia, in the limited\navailability of such corpora and the lack of appropriate software for analysis as well as\nin the fact that translations retrieved from a parallel corpus are only as good as the\ntranslations themselves; personal factors like exhaustion, pressure of time, boredom,\netc. can highly influence the quality of the translation. This goes hand in hand with\nDusan Gabrovsek's \"danger of taking parallel corpora as automatically the most reliable\nand useful sources for cross-linguistic analysis\" (Gabrovsek, e-mail communication\n2004; cf. Toury 1995:275).\n4.3.2. Collocations and Bilingual Lexicography\nCollocations and their status in lexicography have been discussed a lot in the past years.\nAlthough bilingual and monolingual lexicographical approaches to collocations are\nhardly comparable along the same lines of thinking, they do have a common\ndenominator, namely the question where to place a collocation in a dictionary, bilingual\nor monolingual.\nHausmann (1988), for example, sees the representation of collocational information as\none of the three main problems bilingual lexicography is confronted with. Since\nadjective-noun collocations consist of two elements, should collocations be listed under\nthe base (in this case the noun) or under the collocator (the adjective)?\n27 cf. sections 2.4. and 2.5.100\n(I) Different Approaches to the Representation of Collocations in Bilingual Dictionaries\nCop (1990) distinguishes two approaches, the semasiological and the onomasiological\nones. In a nutshell, the semasiological approach to the representation of collocations in\nthe bilingual dictionary means that bases are listed in the collocator entries while the\nonomasiological approach suggests the representation of collocations in the base\nentry28.\nCop (1990: 38) sees the semasiological approach to collocations as an aid to meaning\ndiscrimination of the adjective. The meanings of the adjectives and, consequently, the\ndifferent translations of them, are tailored to the respective base nouns. This approach is\nof equal relevance to decoding and encoding29. Let me illustrate this with the following\nexamples:\nDecoding from English into German\n(for German speakers):\nheavy ADJ (Himmel) bedeckt | (Arbeit, Boden,\nParfum) schwer | (Regen, Raucher) stark |\n(Seufzer) tief\nDecoding from German into English\n(for Eng/is h speakers):\nschwer ADJ (work, soil, perfume) heavy\n(disappointment, shock, storm) severe | (gold)\nsolidEncoding from German into English\n(for German speakers):\nSChwer ADJ (work, soil, perfume\nheavy |(disappointment, shock, storm}\nsevere | (gold) solid\nEncoding from English into German\n(for English speakers):\nheavy ADJ (Himmel) bedeckt | (Arbeit,\nBoden, Parfum) schwer | (Regen,\nRaucher) stark | (Seufzer) tief\nFig. 37: The semasiological approach to collocations in encoding and decoding entries\nNote that for decoding purposes the meaning-discriminating information (in brackets)\nshould be in the user's native language, while for the encoding process the bases are\nbest given in the target language so that the user gets the full target-language collocation\nat once (cf. P\u00e4tzold 1991: 2963).\n28 cf. section 2.2.4.\n29 But is simply much more needed for encoding tasks (Gabrovsek 2004: e-mail communication).101\nCop's onomasiological approach suggests that collocations should be represented in the\nbase entry. For her, this is the perspective encoding dictionaries should adopt (Cop\n1990: 40):\nEncoding from English into German\n(for English speakers);\nperfume N Parfum, Duft\n(angenehm) fragrant | (schwer) heavy j\n(zart) subtleEncoding from German into English\n(for German speakers):\nParfum N perfume\n(fragrant) angenehm | (heavy) schwer '\n(subtle) zart\nFig. 38: The onomasiological approach to collocations in encoding entries\nHeliel (1990: 134-35) points out that the collocator is the unpredictable element in a\ncollocation and that the dictionary user, in encoding, usually knows the equivalent of\nthe base (or they can easily be found in the bilingual dictionary). He or she is mainly\nconcerned with finding the collocates and thus needs the onomasiological approach.\nIn contrast to Cop, Heliel (ibid.) sees the semasiological approach relevant only for\ndecoding purposes since in comprehending a foreign-language collocation it is\nprimarily the collocator that causes difficulties - which is, again, due to semantic\ntailoring.\nHausmann (1988: 149; cf. Bahns 1996: 47) notes that, basically, it makes no difference\nto the translator where he or she will find the collocation, under the base or under the\ncollocator. Still, when the collocation is only listed in one entry, this often results in\ntime-consuming double look-ups. Hausmann thus arrives at the conclusion that a\ncollocation should ideally be found in all four entries: base and collocator of the source\nlanguage and base and collocator of the target language. However, limited space in\nprinted dictionaries makes this an impossible option since \"general bilingual\ndictionaries have a much larger job than just presenting collocations\" (Cop 1991:\n276)30.\n30 The space problem can be easily overcome by the implementation of the dictionary on a CD-ROM.\nFurthermore, I am of the opinion that electronic versions of bilingual dictionaries should have a special\ncollocation feature, such as the one in the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English on CD-ROM.102\nLooking at the four major German-English / English-German dictionaries on the market\n(cf. sections 1.3. and 3.5.1.) we can observe that, first of all, on a purely quantitative\nbasis, in the best of all cases in a German-English encoding translation task of adjective-\nnoun collocations, six German collocations out of 38 are listed under their noun bases\non the German side. 16 collocations were found in the adjective, the collocator, entry\nthough. For the encoding translation of 29 English-German collocations only one\ncollocation was listed explicitly in the noun entry on the English side of the bilingual\ndictionaries in question, while the best dictionary managed 15 collocations given in the\nadjectives entries.\nThus, we might assume that in German and English lexicographical practice the\nsemasiological approach to the representation of collocations prevails; however, if we\nlook at the different user's guides, we will learn otherwise.\nWith regard to adjective-noun collocations the DUOX user's guide informs us that\n\"with adjectives, collocators are nouns which the translations typically qualify. They are\nnormally placed after the translation.\" (Thyen et al. eds. 1999: 25). In the German-\nEnglish part, collocators are in English; in the English-German part they are in German.\nWe see that DUOX treats adjectives as bases and nouns as collocators. This could lead\nto the incorrect assumption that in DUOX collocations are listed under their bases - a\nvital prerequisite for an encoding dictionary as suggested by Hausmann (1988), Heliel\n(1990) and Cop (1991). Without wishing to belittle Thyen et al.'s work, I would prefer\nthem to have applied standard terminology - since, in adjective-noun collocations, the\nnoun IS the base specifying the meaning (and translation) of the pre-modifying\nadjective in the first place.\nLikewise, in the user guide to COGER, Terrell et al. (eds. 1999: xiv-xv) point out, under\nthe heading Explanatory Material, that collocators and typical complements are, in\ncontrast to sense indicators, not in brackets but in italics. In adjective entries the user\nwill find typical nouns that the adjective modifies. They are usually found before the\ntranslation. Again, adjectives are treated as bases and nouns as collocators.103\nIn PONS's user's guide, we find that \"context elements, also called collocates, are given\nin italics\" (MacKenzie, ed. 2003: xiii). Further, we find in adjective entries nouns that\nare typically modified bythem, while in noun entries typical genitive complements can\nbe found (ibid: xiv). Consequently, PONS too lists adjective-noun collocations under\ntheir ('real') collocates and not bases.\nInterestingly, LANGE, which is an abridged version of Der Kleine Muret-Sanders2X -\nwhich would better compared to the three other 'Gro\u00dfw\u00f6rterb\u00fccher'32 - does not state\nanything about collocational treatment in neither of the two user's guides {LANGE is\nactually composed of two different dictionaries, edited by S. Brough and H. Messinger).\nFor my English-German adjective-noun collocation dictionary I adopted the\nonomasiologal approach, i.e. adjective-noun collocation are presented in the base entry.\n(2) Equivalence\nAs already hinted at in section 4.3.1., equivalence is \"the axis about which the activity\nof translation turns\" (Kromann et al. 1991: 2717). There are three types of equivalence:\nfull equivalence, partial equivalence and zero equivalence.\nFull equivalence of adjective-noun collocations in the interlingual light is indicative of\nthe fact that, although the collocational ranges of source- and target-language items\nmight differ, there are overlaps to be found, which results in the easiest-to-encode or\neasiest-to-decode category: predictable and lexically congruent collocations (cf. Heliel\n1990: 131, Maurer-Stroh 2004a: 5), e.g. heavy sea = schwere See and unexpected\ndiscovery = unerwartete Entdeckung (all four elements in the collocations are literal\ntranslations).\n31 While the revision of the English-German part was published in 2001, the German-English part of Der\nKleine Muret-Sanders has not been recently revised (the latest edition dates back to the 1980s) - the\ninformation I obtained from www.lanqenscheidt.de/deutsch/produkte/wb/ms-aesamt.pdf [12/10/2004]\n32 However, an \"inter-Langenscheidt\" comparison carried out by myself revealed a similar treatment of\ncollocations.104\nPartial equivalence can be observed when one of the components of the adjective-noun\ncollocation cannot be literally translated into another language, e.g. heavy smoker vs.\nstarker (= 'strong') Raucher and feverish condition = fieberhafte Erkrankung (=\n'illness').\nIn adjective-noun collocations the item which cannot be rendered directly into the other\nlanguage is usually the adjective - which can be seen as a consequence of the semantic\ntailoring of the adjective to the noun respectively in both languages in question33.\nFinally, zero equivalence means that neither of the two elements of the adjective-noun\ncollocations can be LITERALLY translated, in an adjective-noun structure or otherwise.\nExamples of zero equivalence include idioms (also: endocentric compounds, cf. 2.3.3.)\nas well as structurally incongruent collocations, e.g. red tape = B\u00fcrokratie and a recent\ndiscovery = eine Entdeckung neueren Datums (lit. trans. a discovery with a new date).\nEquivalence, as a technical term in general bilingual lexicography, is discussed in more\ndetail in Kromann et al. (1991: 2717-18) and Svens\u00e9n (1993: 140-62). I will, however,\nnot go into too much detail here since the different concepts of partial equivalence, viz.\ninterlingual anismorphism34, convergence and divergence, are of little relevance to my\nwork as, with collocations, collocators act as sense discriminators.\nPut briefly, in bilingual general lexicography, convergence and divergence call for\ndecisions in the meta-lexicographical light, i.e. concern sense discriminators.\nWe talk about encoding convergence when the LI lexical item has more lexical\nrealisations than the L2 item, e.g. (for English speakers encoding from English into\nGerman) stag night + hen night = Polterabend (= the term used in German for both the\nbride- and the groom-tobe to celebrate their farewell to singledom).\nHere, no sense discriminators have to be given as hen night and stag night constitute\ntwo different entries (in an adjective-noun / noun-noun collocation dictionary like the\n33 cf. Chapter 3.\n34 Full equivalence is referred to as (interlingual) isomorphism.105\none I have in mind the two combinations will be put together under the headword night,\nlisted alphabetically in the 'authentic' [i.e. spelled as one word] compound section).\nIn a general-purpose bilingual dictionary, decoding convergence has to be marked meta-\nlexicographically since one L2 translation corresponds to two LI entries, e.g. (for\nGerman speakers decoding from English into German):\nnews\n1. (generelle neue[re] Ereignisse, lit. trans, recent events in general) Neuigkeiten\n2. (neue[re] Ereignisse, die in der Zeitung oder dem Fernsehen behandelt werden, lit.\ntrans, recent events in the newspapers or broadcast) Nachrichten\nFig. 39: An example of decoding convergence (En-De)\nLikewise, divergence means that the L2 lexical item has more sense realisations than the\nLI item has. Therefore, in decoding divergence, the English speaker decoding from\nGerman into English will get two entries for news, i.e. Nachrichten and Neuigkeit(en).\nIn encoding divergence, the German speaker encoding into English would get one entry\nfor Polterabendwith sense discriminators:\nPolterabend\n(of the bride) hen night, (of the groom) stag night\nFig. 40: An example of encoding divergence (De-En)\nNonetheless, as I have pointed out before, for my English-German adjective noun\ncollocation dictionary I do not have to bother with divergence, convergence and sense\ndiscrimination since collocators (and their translations) normally serve as 'natural'\nmeaning discriminators, e.g. forensic examination ( = thorough investigation) vs. oral\nexamination (= test of one's knowledge).106\n4.4. Towards a Bilingual Adjective-Noun Collocation Dictionary of\nEnglish and German\nSo, what needs to be considered in the compilation process of a bilingual adjective-noun\ncollocation dictionary of English and German?\n(1) Linguistic aspect - general-purpose vs. specialised\n(2) User aspect / target group considerations - which function and direction will the\ndictionary have?\n(3) Linguistic aspect - headword selection, e.g. which headwords, in my case nouns,\nwill I deal with in the dictionary?\n(4) Empirical aspect - where will I get the collocations and their translations from?\nWhat will I include or exclude?\n(5) User aspect - how will I present the information?\nEach of these questions will be answered in the next chapter.107\n5. Methods of Compiling an Adjective-Noun Collocation\nDictionary of English and German\nAs Svens\u00e9n (1993: 4) points out, the work on a dictionary cannot start until suitable\nmaterials to form the basis of the compilation process have been collected and selected.\nBefore deciding on the material, however, the lexicographer has to determine which\ntype of dictionary he or she is going to produce. Principally, there are two decisions to\nbe made: (1) monolingual vs. bilingual and (2) general-purpose vs. specialised.\nA collocation dictionary is a specialised dictionary1 since it only deals with one aspect\nof the headwords, namely their combinability patterns. Yet, an adjective-noun\ncollocation dictionary is even more focused.\nAs already hinted at in sections 1.2. and 1.3. and discussed in Chapter 4, there are very\nfew monolingual collocation dictionaries available while I am aware of even fewer\nbilingual ones. Although general bilingual dictionaries do contain collocational\ninformation, collocations as a whole are far from being comprehensively covered there\nsince studies I carried out revealed that only up to about 80% of the adjective-noun\ncollocations tested could be translated with the help of the four major German and\nEnglish dictionaries on the market. Hence my decision to create a bilingual adjective-\nnoun collocation dictionary.\nAnother reason for choosing the adjective-noun structure was that, in this way, I am\nable to compare different compilation methods including a fairly simple probability-\nbased retrieval of adjacent (in this case adjective + noun) words from a German and\nEnglish parallel corpus.\nNext, the lexicographer needs to decide which function and direction the dictionary will\nhave. For my English-German adjective-noun collocation dictionary I came to the\n1 There are, basically, two types of specialisation: linguistic (etymology, usage, proper names,\npronunciation, etc.) and field (e.g. astronomy, cooking, advertising) (Gabrovsek 2004: e-mail\ncommunication).108\ndecision that, in the absence of an English native-speaker lexicographer, I should\ncompile an encoding English-into-German dictionary (for English users). In this way I,\nas the lexicographer, can decode into my mother tongue, thus not only relying on the\ncorpus information or material taken from existing dictionaries (English and German)\nbut also using my native-speaker intuition.\nNaturally, an encoding English-German dictionary for speakers of English is a mono-\nfunctional and mono-directional work, yet, as I pointed out in section 4.3.1., it could\nalso be used for decoding purposes by German speakers (since it is this process that\nactually takes place in the compilation process).\nThen again, such a dictionary provided with an index of German nouns in the back\nmatter could also be valuable in decoding for English speakers and encoding for\nGerman speakers, the only drawback being that a double look-up is necessary2.\nThis brings us to think of the format the dictionary will have, viz. will it be a print\ndictionary, an electronic one, or both? For the moment, I decided on a print version\nonly, but to convert it into CD-ROM or online format is an easy step that could be done\nwithin days, since the contents and layout remain the same and all that has to be done in\norder for the dictionary to be searchable via various queries is to link all the adjectives\nand nouns in it with a searchable database.\nAs a result, the English user wanting to encode into German could perform their\nsearches starting from an English noun or an English adjective; when wishing to decode\nfrom German into English, the English user simply switches the language in the\ninterface. Likewise, the German user wishing to encode into English can start his or her\nquery from a German adjective or noun, or, in decoding, simply switches the language\nand starts from the English nouns and adjectives.\nThe interface of my English-German adjective-noun collocation dictionary could look\nlike this:\n2 Although, naturally, \"encoding and decoding in a collocational dictionary can never really be on a par\nwith each other, not even roughly, whichever way you look at it.\" (Gabrovsek 2004: e-mail\ncommunication).109\nEN-GE ADJ-N COLLOCATIONS\nframework Search Options\nbasis\ncollection\ncomparison\ncondition\ncontent\ndiscovery\ndiscussion\nexamination\nframework\nmechanism\npopulation\nprinciple\nproposalframework\nadministrative administrative Struktur | analytical\nanalytischer Rahmen, analytische Struktur | basic\ngrundlegende Struktur | broad breiter / grober\nRahmen | chronological chronologischer Rahmen,\nchronologische Struktur | coherent einheitlicher\nRahmen, koh\u00e4rente Struktur, zusammenh\u00e4ngende\nAbfolge | comprehensive umfassender Rahmen |\nconceptual konzeptueller Rahmen | constitutional\ngesetzlicher / konstitutioneller Rahmen | convenient\ng\u00fcnstiger / passender Rahmen | democratic\ndemokratische Struktur | economic wirtschaftliche\nStruktur, wirtschaftlicher Rahmen | existing\nbestehende Struktur | financial finanzieller Rahmen,\nfinanzielle Struktur | historical historischer Rahmen |\nlegal gesetzlicher / rechtlicher Rahmen | political\npolitischer Rahmen, politische Struktur | theoretical\nGer\u00fcst | wider gr\u00f6\u00dferer Rahmen\nFig. 41: Graphical user interface of an English-German adjective-noun collocation dictionary\nThe next question to be addressed before the actual compilation process is which\nheadwords will be included in the dictionary. As we have seen in section A3.2., an\nadjective-noun collocation dictionary should, if the collocations are not listed under\nboth constituents, best list collocations in the base entry, viz. the noun entry. So, the\npoint at issue for my dictionary is where to get a list of nouns from. For illustration\npurposes in this thesis I compared Michael West's General Service List from 19533, the\nLongman Defining Vocabulary from 19874, and a list of nouns frequently used in\nacademic writing (Hayes 1999: 53-55).\nAs published, the General Service List is a medium-sized book organized like a dictionary. It is an\ninventory of 2,000 words selected to be of the greatest \"general service\" to learners of English. They are\nnot the commonest 2,000 words, though frequency was one of the factors taken into account in making\nthe selection. The version I used had been amended with word frequency information by John Bauman\nand Brent Culligan in 1995 and made available at http://ibauman.com/aboutasl.html [13/10/2004].\n4 The Longman Defining Vocabulary is a list of roughly 2,100 words which the Longman Dictionary of\nContemporary English 1987 uses to express all its definitions. As such, it is a useful source of basic\nvocabulary. This version is taken from http://www3.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~irk/conlanq.dir/LonqmanVocab.html\n[12/12/2004]. Although the website states 1988 as the original date they seem to refer to the 1987 version of\nthe dictionary since there was no edition published in 1988. Note that the defining vocabulary is amended\nin each edition of the dictionary and listed in the back matter.110\nSince the General Service List and the Longman Defining Vocabulary contain not only\nnouns, I first had to find a way of retrieving only these nouns. What I did was have the\ntwo word lists tagged for parts of speech by Oliver Mason's QTAG5.1 deleted all other\nword classes and came up with 1,137 nouns from the Longman Defining Vocabulary\nand 1,395 nouns from the General Service List. The intersection of the two lists and\nHayes's list of nouns used in academic writing resulted in 22 nouns. These are: basis,\ncollection, comparison, condition, content, discovery, discussion, effect, examination,\nframework, influence, inquiry, measures, mechanism, population, principle, proposal,\nrange, remedy, sample, study and tendency. From these I randomly chose 16 nouns\nfrom which I created dictionary entries for the English-German adjective-noun\ncollocation dictionary (see Appendix D).\nIn practice, that is, when compiling a dictionary of this kind that is to be published, the\nselection of headwords should be carefully made. I am, however, convinced that a\ncombination of the nouns from the General Service List and the Longman Defining\nVocabulary, together amounting to 1,692 nouns, would be a good starting point. In\naddition, the most frequent nouns from the British National Corpus, for example, could\nbe compared to these 1,692 nouns. In this way, the headword list would contain not\nonly 'easy' nouns from learners' lists but also more sophisticated, maybe technical, and\nup-to-date material.\nNext on the list of decisions prior to the actual compilation process is the question of\nwhere I get the collocations and their translations from.\nAs Svens\u00e9n (1993: 40) points out, the material to be taken into consideration should be\nauthentic. Well, authenticity can be achieved by drawing on corpora and existing\ndictionaries which are based on a sizeable corpus of naturally occurring written and\nspoken text. For this purpose I decided to retrieve my collocational material from the\nfour major English monolingual learner's dictionaries, COBUILD-CD, LDOCE, MAC\nand OALD - all corpus-based dictionaries. Additionally, I added the collocations listed\nin the three leading English monolingual collocation dictionaries, viz. the BBI, the LTP\n5 I downloaded the tagger from http://web,bham.ac.uk/o.mason/software/taqqer/ in May 2003, it seems,\nhowever, that it is no longer available from this address free of charge.Ill\nand the OCD. Further, I searched the British National Corpus for adjective-noun\ncombinations through William Fletcher's Phrases in English6. All collocations that\ncame up at least twice (e.g. in at least two dictionaries or one dictionary and the corpus)\nwere candidates for inclusion.\nAs a next step, I conducted full-text searches on COLLINS-E and DUOX-E for the\nEnglish nouns. All explicitly listed adjective-noun combinations were retrieved from\nthese two bilingual dictionaries and compared with my list of English collocations.\nAgain, the inclusion criterion was that the collocation had to be listed at least twice, i.e.\nin at least two dictionaries or one dictionary and the corpus.\nFor collocations which were not readily translatable with the full-text search in the two\nbilingual dictionaries I searched DUST and a German corpus that could be compared in\nboth size and design with the British National Corpus, namely the corpus from Digitales\nW\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache''. This procedure will be discussed in more detail\nand illustrated in section 5.2.\nFinally, in the planning stage already, the lexicographer has to decide on the way the\ninformation should be presented to the user. The micostructure should demonstrate a\nclear organisation and help the user find the information they want in a straightforward\nway.\nHaving done a lot of research in the field of German and English adjective-noun\ncollocations, I knew from the beginning that I would have to deal with not only\nstructurally congruent collocations but also structurally incongruent ones (cf. Chapter\n3). This makes it obvious that the entries should be given in more than one section, so\nthat the user could see at once which is not rendered as adjective + noun into German. I\ndecided on four sections:\n(1) The structurally congruent English-German adjective + noun section, e.g. sparse\npopulation = schwache Besiedelung.\n6 Available at: http://pie.usna.edu/ [09/12/2004].\n7 Available at http://www.dwds.de [09/12/2004].112\n(2) The structurally incongruent English-German adjective + noun section, e.g. a\ncold remedy = ein Mittel gegen Erk\u00e4ltung [lit. trans. a remedy for cold]. Also\nlisted in this section are collocations which are different in their translation from\nsection (1) when a particular verb goes with them, e.g. drastic remedies =\ndrastische Mittel vs. to apply drastic remedies = (lit.) drastische Mittel\nergreifen, (fig.) mit eisernen Besen kehren [lit. trans. do the sweeping with an\niron broom).\n(3) Section 3 lists English collocations which occur in a particular frame, with a\n'slot', e.g. within a prepositional phrase, such as on a ... basis or in ... condition.\n(4) Section 4 lists all English adjective-noun collocations which are to be rendered\ninto German as 'authentic' compounds or simplex words, e.g. general tendency\n\u2014 Grundrichtung and commercial sample = Muster.\nNote that collocations can be listed in more than one section, e.g.\n(1) drastic remedies drastische Mittel\n(2) to apply drastic remedies (lit.) zu drastischen Mitteln greifen\n(fig.) mit eisernem Besen kehren\n(4) drastic / kill-or-cure remedy Radikalkur, Rosskur\n(1 ) free sample unverk\u00e4ufliches Muster\n(4) free sample Gratismuster, Gratisprobe\nThe methodology I have outlined in the above passages can be referred to as the corpus-\nbased approach. The corpus-based approach to lexicography means that the corpus acts\nas a sort of complementary help in the compilation process, e.g. to check frequencies of\nwords, look for their collocational behaviour, extract sample sentences, etc. The corpus-\ndriven approach, on the other hand, is one where, in the compilation process, the corpus\nis the only source for information retrieval (cf. Tognini-Bonelli 2001: 65 and 84).\nhi the following sections I will present these two approaches in more detail.113\n5.1. The Corpus-Driven Approach\nAs already pointed out, the corpus-driven approach means that the corpus is the only\nsource for information retrieval. So, which type of corpus do we need for the retrieval of\nbilingual adjective-noun collocations? The best suitable material for this task is a\nparallel corpus, i.e. texts and their translations, and suitable software.\nHow can the computer help in generating translation equivalents of adjective-noun\ncollocations?\nShocking (and incomprehensible) as it may seem, the computer does not know that the\nGerman word Amok, for example, is the translation equivalent of the word amok in\nEnglish. Tragically, the computer does not even know that, given the two languages,\nEnglish and German, Amok has to be German because of the capitalisation of nouns.\nGiven that no dictionary or grammar whatsoever is implemented in the process of\ncollocation retrieval, the minimum requirement for a bilingual extraction of word\ncombinations is, as I have pointed out above, to have a parallel corpus.\nKeeping in mind that the computer still has no idea how to correlate these two files, we\nhave to provide small, then smaller, parallel chunks that the computer can deal with.\nStarting from paragraph alignment (paragraph 1 in file 1 is paragraph 1 in file 2 - which\nis easy to detect by paragraph markers) and telling the computer that.!? end a sentence,\nlogical algorithms concerning sentence length (if sentence 1 in file 1 has 30 characters it\ncannot be sentence 1 in file 2 with 5 characters) and approximate matching string\nsimilarity (which would generate Parlament and parliament in one sentence) can be\napplied to an instance of alignment on sentence level. The most widely used sentence\nalignment algorithm nowadays is the one proposed by K.W. Church and W.A. Gale8,\nwhich has been implemented, inter alia, in P. Danielsson and D. Ridings's Vanilla\nAligner and Fieldl et al.'s ANCR - which I will discuss later on in more detail.\nSee http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/J/J93/J93-1004.pdf [9/12/2004].114\nWhen the two corpora are aligned on sentence level, there are, principally, two corpus-\ndriven methodologies available for the retrieval of bilingual adjective-noun collocations,\nnamely (1) making use of parts of speech and (2) making use of statistics.\nTo exemplify the part-of-speech approach to how to compile a bilingual collocation\ndictionary, I constructed an annotated specialised parallel corpus consisting of roughly\n30 sentences9.\nWhen writing the corpus texts I took care to use some adjective-noun combinations\nmore often than others. I manually sentence-aligned the texts (the basic requirement)\nand annotated them: I tokenised them (as a first step to making the computer work more\nefficiently), lemmatised them (to avoid distortion by the German inflection system), and\nPOS-tagged them (I assigned a part-of-speech to each lemma in order to have clues for\nparallel concordancing).\n(1) Sentence Alignment and Tokenising\nAs pointed out before, in order for a researcher to be able to computationally work with\ntexts and their translations, the texts have to be, in a first step, sentence-aligned.\nAnother necessary precondition for the (linguistic) processing of texts is the\n'tokenising', which means that words have to be separated from punctuation marks (see\nFig. 42).\nThis can be done by simple replace-commands. The computer will, then, no longer take\nrain, and rain as two different occurrences of the lemma RAIN.\nProblems occur when tokenising English abbreviated forms (such as isn't and I'd) and\nGerman colloquial forms (such as Was gibt's?) as well as dates. I will, however, not go\ninto detail here since this is only done for the purpose of illustrating the corpus-driven\npart-of-speech approach.\n1 The texts can be found in Appendix C.115\nEin schlechtes Zeichen ,\ndenn der Wetterbericht sagt\nschwere St\u00fcrme voraus.\nManchmal\nschwere St\u00fcrme .gibt es auch\nEin schlechtes Zeichen .\ndenn der Wetterbericht sagte\nschwere St\u00fcrme in dieser\nGegend voraus.A bad sign . The weather\nforecast is for severe\ngales.\nSometimes there are even\nsevere gales.\nA bad sign . The weather\nforecast was for severe\ngales in this region .\nFig. 42: Sentence alignment and tokenising\n(2) Tagging & Lemmatising\nTo tag a corpus means to assign a part-of-speech label to each token (= word) in the\ntext. Theoretically, the corpus can then be simply searched for patterns of, for example,\nadjectives preceding nouns.\nHowever, an automatic tagger can only work accurately on a text file if it knows all the\nwords in the file along with their inflectional behaviour (which can be quite demanding\nfor German!). This is why taggers either have to be trained on existing already tagged\ncorpora of the respective language (to proceed to do what they have learned), or a\ncomprehensive grammar of the language in question has to be implemented - which can\nbe a daunting task.\nThe process of tagging goes hand in hand with a preliminary lemmatisation of the\ntokens in a text. Lemmatising means that each token in a text is 'transferred back' to its\nroot form, meaning that nouns are set to nominative singular, verbs to infinitives, etc.116\nein schlecht Zeichen ,\nWetterbericht sagen\nSturm voraus .denn der\nschwer\nmanchmal geben ich auch\nschwer Sturm .\nein schlecht Zeichen .\nWetterbericht sagen\nSturm in dieser Gegenddenn der\nschwer\nvoraus .a bad\nbe forsign The\nsevere gale\nsometimes\ngale.\na bad\nbe forsignthere\nThe\nsevere galeweather forecast\n\u2022\nbe even severe\nweather forecast\nin this region .\nFig. 43: Lemmatising\n1. ein_ARTIND schiecht_ADJ Zeichen_SUB ,_SZK denn_KONNEB dcr_ARTDEF\nWetterbcricht_SUB sagenVER schwerADJ SturmSUB vorausADV .SZE\n2. manchmal_ADV geben_VER ich_PERPRO auch_ADV schwcr_AD.I SiurmSlJB\n.SZE\n3. ein_ARTlND sch!echt_ADJ Zeichen_SUB ,_SZK dennJCONNEB der.ARTDEI7\nVVetterbericht_SUB sagen_VER schwer_ADJ SturmSlJB inPRP dieserDEMPRO\nGegendSUB vorausADV .SZE\n1. a_ARTlND bad_ADJ signSUB ._SZE The_ARTDEF weathcr_SUB forccastSUB\n|->e_VERAUX forPRP severe_AD.I gale_SUB ,_$ZE\n2. $ometime$_ADV thereADV beVERAUX evenADV scvereADJ galcSUB\n._SZE\n3. aARTIND bad_ADJ sign_SUB ._SZE TheARTDEF weatherSlJB forecast_SUB\nbeVERAUX for_PRP severe_ADJ gale_SUB in_PRP this_DEMPRO rcgion_Sl;B\n. SZE\nFig. 44: Tagging\nCollocations, in a monolingual corpus, are usually detected via several statistical\nmeasurements (cf 2.5.) When, for example, the actual co-occurrence of words in a\ncorpus is higher than the random co-occurrence, the word combination can be called a\ncollocation.117\nQuite in contrast to this, I will, for the most part of this approach to bilingual collocation\nretrieval, stick to simple absolute frequency counts.\nStarting with a frequency list of the words in the German corpus, all lemmas which\nhave not been tagged as a noun are excluded. A threshold should be set for the\nminimum number of occurrences of the source-language (= SL) node (in our case: the\nnoun).\nAs a next step, each valid node will be searched for its preceding adjectives. This can be\ndone by a POS-sensitive query: We take each node and attach to it the preceding lemma\nthat has been annotated as adjective.\nIf we take the number six as the threshold for the minimum occurrence of the nouns to\nbe taken into account, we get the following output for adjective-noun collocations in\nGerman:\nsentence\n21\n29\n8\n19\n28\n7\n11\n31\n20\n18\n27\n6\n30\n9\n20adjective\ntobend_ADJ\ntobend_ADJ\ntobend_ADJ\nschwer_ADJ\nschwerADJ\nschwerADJ\nb\u00f6ig_ADJ\nb\u00f6ig_ADJ\nb\u00f6ig_ADJ\neisig_ADJ\neisig_ADJ\neisig_ADJ\nstiirmisch_ADJ\nsttirmisch_ADJ\nst\u00fcrmisch ADJnoun\nSturm_SUB\nSturm_SUB\nSturm_SUB\nSturm_SUB\nSturm_SUB\nSturm_SUB\nWind_SUB\nWind_SUB\nWind_SUB\nWind_SUB\nWind_SUB\nWind_SUB\nWind_SUB\nWind_SUB\nWind SUB118\nAs a next step, we take the English adjective-noun concordances and connect them with\nthe respective sentences in the German corpus.\nAs an optimum, each of the respective sentences in English and German only has one\nadjective-noun combination - as is the case with sentences 7, 19 and 28, for example.\nConsequently, the resulting adjective-noun collocations are translation equivalents:\nGerman\n19 schwer_ADJ\n28 schwer_ADJ\n7 schwer ADJSturm_SUB\nSturm_SUB\nSturm SUBEnglish\n19 severe_ADJ\n28 severe_ADJ\n7 severe ADJgale_SUB\ngale_SUB\ngale_SUB\nIf, however, a sentence has more than one adjective-noun combination, the computer\ncannot know which is the translation equivalent of which combination, as in sentence\n21, for example:\n21. eigentlich_ADV m\u00f6gen_VERMOD ich_PERPRO beide_DEMPRO ,_SZK\nein_ARTIND tobend_ADJ Sturm_SUB und_KONNEB ein_ARTIND\nangenehm_ADJ Brise_SUB ._SZE\n21. LPERPRO actually_ADV like_VER both_DEMPRO ,_SZK a_ARTIND\nfierce_ADJ gale_SUB and_KONNEB a_ARTIND pleasant_ADJ breeze_SUB\n. SZE\nAs a solution, one might divide the process of bilingual collocation retrieval into the\nfollowing steps: (1) First, only sentences containing just one adjective-noun\ncombination are validated. The resulting translation equivalents of this process have to\nbe stored for the next step. (2) Second, the validated translation equivalents from the\nfirst step are used as a reference dictionary for cases where more than one adjective-\nnoun collocation is found in a sentence. If the sentence contains two adjective-noun\ncombinations, for example, and one of them has already been stored in the first process,\nthen the remaining adjective-noun combination of the SL can be assigned to the\nremaining adjective-noun combination in the target language (= TL) as its translation\nequivalent. Again, these results have to be stored for later use. (3) The process of the119\nsecond step has to be continued until every 'known' adjective-noun pair has been\ngenerated and all stored and validated translations of adjective-noun combinations from\nstep one and step two have been split into translation equivalents of adjective lemmas\nand noun lemmas. With the help of these, the remaining sentences can be processed.\nLet me briefly exemplify these steps. Sentence 20, for example, contains three\nadjective-noun pairs:\nwenn_KONUNT drau\u00dfen_ADV ein_ARTIND Sturm_SUB toben_VER ,_SZK\nbleiben_VER der_ARTDEF Leute_SUB zu_PRP Haus_SUB und_KONNEB\nbeobachten_VER der_ARTDEF stiirmisch_ADJ Wind_SUB ,_SZK der_ARTDEF\nb\u00f6ig_ADJ Wind_SUB und_KONNEB der_ARTDEF stark_ADJ Regen_SUB\n\u2022_SZE\nwhen_KONUNT i_PERPRO blow_VER a_ARTIND gale_SUB outside_ADV ,_SZE\npeople_SUB stay_VER at_PRP home_SUB and_KONNEB watch_VER\nthe_ARTDEF blustery_ADJ wind_SUB ,_SZK the_ARTDEF gusty_ADJ\nwind_SUB and_KONNEB the_ARTDEF heavy_ADJ rain_SUB _SZE\nAs a result from the first step - where obvious translation equivalents were extracted\nfrom sentences only containing one adjective-noun collocation - we know that\nst\u00fcrmisch + Wind is the translation of blustery + wind (sentence 9), which leaves us\nonly two adjective-noun pairs to deal with:\n,_SZK der_ARTDEF b\u00f6ig_ADJ Wind_SUB und_KONNEB der_ARTDEF\nstark_ADJ Regen_SUB _SZE\n,_SZK the_ARTDEF gusty_ADJ wind_SUB and_KONNEB the_ARTDEF\nheavy_ADJ rain_SUB _SZE\nSince stilrmischADJ + WindJSub and blustery ADJ + wind_SUB are already stored in\nour database as translation equivalents, we can split these combinations and their\ntranslation into: st\u00fcrmischADJ = blustery ADJ and Wind_SUB = windSUB.120\nAs a result, we can disambiguate the above excerpt of sentence 20 by claiming that b\u00f6ig\n+ Wind has to be the translation of gusty + Wind, because Wind is the translation of\nwind and not of rain. Consequently, we also get the translation equivalents stark +\nRegen and heavy + rain.\nBoth the monolingual and the bilingual collocation extractions have to be done starting\nfrom both languages, meaning that we have to go through both processes with either\nGerman or English as the SL. This is absolutely vital when considering the following\ncase:\nAs a threshold, the minimum occurrence of the node nouns was set to six. Starting from\nGerman as the SL, we would get the following output:\nGerman English\nstr\u00f6mend_ADJ Regen_SUB pouring_ADJ rain_SUB\nstr\u00f6mend_ADJ RegenSUB pouring_ADJ rain_SUB\nstr\u00f6mend_ADJ RegenSUB pouring_ADJ rain_SUB\nstark_ADJ Regen_SUB heavy_ADJ rain_SUB\nstark_ADJ Regen_SUB heavy_ADJ rainSUB\nstark_ADJ Regen_SUB heavy_ADJ rain_SUB\nIf, however, English was the SL, the output would be the following:\nEnglish German\npouring_ADJ rainSUB str\u00f6mend_ADJ Regen_SUB\npouring_ADJ rainSUB str\u00f6mend_ADJ Regen_SUB\npouring_ADJ rain_SUB str\u00f6mend_ADJ Regen_SUB\nheavy_ADJ rainSUB stark_ADJ Regen_SUB\nheavy_ADJ rain_SUB stark_ADJ Regen_SUB\nheavy_ADJ rain_SUB stark_ADJ Regen_SUB\ntorrential_ADJ rain_SUB wolkenbruchartig_ADJ Schauer_SUB\ntorrential_ADJ rain_SUB wolkenbruchartig_ADJ Schauer_SUB\ntorrential_ADJ rain_SUB wolkenbruchartig_ADJ Schauer_SUB121\nThe problem here is that some words have more than one translation equivalent and\nsome translations are more frequently used than others. We see that rain can be\ntranslated as Regen or Schauer. Regen is used six times and Schauer only comes up\nthree times (and as the threshold was set to six, it did not appear at all in the list of\ncandidates taken from the German corpus).\nIn more practical terms, dictionary compilation along these lines would, if done strictly\nautomatically, need a huge corpus and, most importantly, an accurate linguistic\npreprocessing.\nAn example of a program which could help with the semi-automatic corpus-driven\ncompilation of an English-German adjective-noun collocation dictionary is a parallel\nconcordances Michael Barlow's Paraconc (cf. 2.4.4.). With the help of Paraconc, the\nlexicographer could search for all noun occurrences of rain preceded by an adjective\nand validate them manually:\n^^j^ljBS^\ncy AOJ wind SUB and KONNEB the AHTDEF heavy_ADJ rain_SUB ,_SZE LPER\u2122 actually_ADV like_VER b..\n1 ...

The filters we are currently using exclude n-grams with stopwords,\nnumerals, symbols, special characters, strings with less than three characters and\nn-grams including capitalised English words - as these can be taken to be proper\nnouns. Additionally, only German bi-grams with the second word starting with\nthe capital letter are included for further processing - this filter has been\nimplemented since in German nouns - in contrast to other word classes - are\ncapitalised; in this way, we can secure that only nouns and their immediately\npreceding elements are extracted11.\na. German and English words which are part of an n-gram are saved in\ntemporary files (viz. a German and English one).\nb. Also German and English n-grams are stored in temporary files.\n(3) In step 3 the program generates n-gram pairs by comparing each valid n-gram\nfrom step 2b with the respective target file (sentence-per-sentence). All parallel\nn-grams are counted and stored in a temporary file (sorted by their parallel\nfrequency).\n(4) Now the probability is calculated for each parallel, i.e. bilingual, n-gram. For\nthis, the absolute frequency of each German n-gram and German word in the\nGerman corpus is contrasted with the absolute frequency of each English n-gram\nand English word in the English file and compared to the parallel frequency list\nfrom step 3.\n11 Here, we work from the assumption that articles and pronouns have been filtered out by the stopword\nlist already.125\n(5) In the final step, n-gram pairs with a lower probability than that set in the\nstarting window will be excluded and the result is saved as a .txt file in the\ndirectory you chose.\nWe increased the calculated n-gram size from only bi-grams (adjective + noun) to also\ntri-grams since more than 60% of the errors in the first release of ANCR were due to the\ndifference in German and English compounding, that is, that in German compounds are\nspelled as one word while in English they are usually spelled separately, e.g. schlechte\nArbeitsbedingungen = poor working conditions (2:3 correspondence).\nWith ANCR - release 5 we have achieved a 76.4% performance as opposed to 56.3% in\nthe first version.\nWhen the program has created the result file, it has to be converted into a database that\ncan be read by the graphical user interface. For this, you simply use the 'file - convert\ntxt to MDB' command. All you have to do now to start your analysis is to load the\ndatabase into the interface.\nANCR releases I result_50.mdb\nFie Options ' Help\nI pUnguage\u2014-\nI | C German C English\nResu\u00abs:l 'Total ngrairo: 33411 I-Ma!ches \u2022\u2014ZZZI~~.

I collected all adjective collocators for the\nEnglish noun discovery which their (common-birthday) statistical calculation retrieved\nfrom an English corpus of 266,799,551 tokens. Likewise, I used the same tool to\nretrieve adjective collocators for the German equivalent Entdeckung run on the\n518,209,793-token German corpus12.\nI translated each of the adjectives, English and German, with the help of their corpus-\ndriven dictionary and based on my decisions of correct translation equivalents on pure\nquanitative findings, i.e. which equivalents occurred more often.\nAs a result, I was able to compile the following entry:\ndiSCOVery Entdeckung f\naccidental zuf\u00e4llige | archaeological arch\u00e4ologische |\ngrisly gr\u00e4ssliche, grausige | gruesome gr\u00e4ssliche,\ngrausige, furchtbare, schreckliche | important\nbedeutende, entscheidende, wichtige | interesting\ninteressante, merkw\u00fcrdige, seltsame, spannende |\nlatest neueste | major bedeutende, gr\u00f6\u00dfte, wichtige j\nmost important wichtigste | most recent j\u00fcngste j\nrecent j\u00fcngste, neueste | significant bedeutende,\nwichtige | startling aufsehenerregende | unexpected\n\u00fcberraschende, unerwartete\nFig. 51 : Corpus-driven entry for discovery\n12 These numbers are taken from an e-mail communication (October 2004) with Matthias Richter who is a\nmember of the Projekt Deutscher Wortschatz team.128\nThe result looks quite acceptable. If we compare it with the entry for discovery which I\ncompiled along my - corpus-based - methodology, the drawbacks become obvious.\ndiscovery\namazing erstaunliche Entdeckung |\narchaeological arch\u00e4ologische Entdeckung,\narch\u00e4ologischer Fund | great gro\u00dfe Entdeckung |\ngrim grauenvolle / grausige Entdeckung |\nimportant wichtige Entdeckung / wichtige\nErkenntis | incredible erstaunliche /, (coll.)\nunglaubliche Entdeckung | major wichtige\nEntdeckung | new (PL) neue Entdeckungen | recent\ndie j\u00fcngste / neueste Entdeckung | remarkable\nbemerkenswerte / verbl\u00fcffende Entdeckung |\nrevolutionary revolutionierende Entdeckung j\nscientific wissenschaftliche Entdeckung j\nsignificant bedeutsame / bedeutungsvolle\nEntdeckung | startling aufregende / sensationelle\nEntdeckung | surprising \u00fcberraschende\nEntdeckung | terrible (coil.) f\u00fcrchterliche /\nschreckliche Entdeckung | unexpected\nunerwartete Entdeckung\n\u2022 an inspired discovery (fig.) das Ei des\nKolumbus\na recent discovery eine Entdeckung neueren\nDatums\n\u2022 new discovery (lit. a. fig.)

Second, in Fig. 52b, variation in the translation\nequivalent of the noun does not show, e.g. archaeological discovery = arch\u00e4ologische\nEntdeckung or arch\u00e4ologischer Fund. Next, German compounds could not be retrieved\nwith the corpus-driven method, e.g. new discovery = Neuentdeckung. Finally, register\nlabels can not be extracted from a corpus, but from existing corpus-based dictionaries.\n5.2. The Corpus-Based Approach\nThe corpus-based approach (i.e. one using [comparable] corpora and existing, corpus-\nbased, dictionaries) is the methodology which I found best suited for the compilation of\nan adjective-noun collocation dictionary of English and German.129\nIn contrast to the corpus-driven approach where the corpus is the only source for\ninformation retrieval, the corpus-based methodology in lexicography uses the corpus as\na kind of complementary help in the compilation process.\nWhat kind of complementary help can be envisaged from a corpus? Well, when writing\na bilingual collocation dictionary, the two corpora13 can be searched for the statistical\nsignificance of collocations, for example. Furthermore, concordance lines generated for\nthe keywords can be looked at for patterns, or different senses of those words can be\nstudied.\nIn the compilation process of my sample entries I made extensive use of corpora for the\nsimple reason of reassurance on the part of the lexicographer. Being a native speaker of\nGerman creating encoding English-German entries basically meant putting myself in\nthe position of an English native speaker; however, I could only benefit in the\ntranslation process since this was actually a decoding task being done into my mother\ntongue, from English into German.\nAs I have pointed out earlier in this chapter, I drew my headwords from the intersection\nof Michael West's General Service List, the Longman Defining Vocabulary and MX.\nHayes's (1999) list of nouns that are frequently used in academic writing. I randomly\nchose 16 nouns to illustrate my methodology (the sample dictionary section including\nthe user's guide and a back-matter index can be seen in Appendix D)14. In the following\nI will comment on the creation of the entry for sample.\nHaving laid down preliminaries, i.e. my dictionary policy15,1 started with the collection\nof the material.\n13 The two corpora do not have to be parallel ones, but they should be comparable in terms of size, design\nand text genres represented in it. For the compilation of a dictionary that is not restricted to special jargon,\nthe corpus should be of a general nature: \"The value of a general corpus as a place of reference is very\ngreat [...]. More and more people in every branch of information science are coming to realize that a\ncorpus as a sample of the living language, accessed by sophisticated computers, opens new horizons.\"\n(Sinclair 1991: 14).\n14 The nouns I covered are: basis, collection, comparison, condition, content, discovery, discussion,\nexamination, framework, mechanism, population, principle, proposal, remedy, sample, and tendency.\n15 cf. Section 4.4. and pp. 107-12130\nI collected all adjective-noun collocations from the four major English monolingual\nlearner's dictionaries based on corpora, viz. COBUILD, LDOCE, MAC and OALD.\nNext, I searched English monolingual collocation dictionaries, namely the BBI, LTP and\nOCD16 for adjectives that collocate with sample. Then I searched the British National\nCorpus through PIE for adjectives preceding sample. Finally, I conducted a full-text\nsearch in my electronic version of two comprehensive bilingual English-German\ndictionaries, COLLINS-E and DUOX-E11, for sample and retrieved from it all adjective-\nnoun collocations and their translations.\nI saved all this information in a file, re-ordered it so that the adjective collocators were\nin first position, and attached to it the source where I got them from, i.e. bilingual\ndictionary, collocation dictionary, corpus, learner's dictionary. Then I sorted the list\nalphabetically. In this way, I was able to count the occurrences of the particular\ncombinations. The resulting table can be seen below (Table 5):\nADJECTIVE\nadvertising\nbiased\nbiased\nblood\nblood\nblood\nblood\nblood\nWood\nblood\nblood\nblood\ncarbon-bearing\nclinical\nclinical\ncommercial\ncommercial\ncore\ndifferent\nentire\nenvironmentalSOURCE\nin one bilingual dictionary\nin one collocation or learner's dictionary\nin PIE (singular)\nin more than one collocation or learner's dictionary\nmore than once in both bilingual dictionaries\nin PIE (plural)\nin PIE (plural)\nin one collocational or learner's dictionary\nin one collocation or learner's dictionary\nin one bilingual dictionary\nin one bilingual dictionary\nin PIE (plural)\nin PIE (singular)\nin PIE (plural)TRANSLATION\nWerbemuster\n(MED) Blutprobe\ntaking of blood sample - Blutentnahme\nBlutprobe\nBlutprobe\nhave a blood sample taken - Blut\nabgenommen bekommen\ntaking of a blood sample - Blutentnahme\n/ to go to the doctor to have a blood\nsample taken = zur Blutentnahme zum\nArzt gehen\nBlutprobe\ntake a blood example from somebody -\njemandem Blut / eine Blutprobe\nentnehmen\nMuster\nBohrprobe\n16 OCD is the only collocation dictionary available based on a computerised corpus.\n17 Both COLLINS-E and DUOX-E are said to be corpus-based, but I only know for sure (since the front\nmatter of the print dictionary says so) that COLLINS-E is based on at least one computerised corpus,\nCollins Wordbanks (a corpus in lexicography can be any collection of text, citations etc. used for\ncompilation purposes).131\nfaecal\nfaecal\nfair\nformal\nfree\nfree\nfree\nfree\nfree\nfree\nfree\nfree\nfree\nfurther\ngood\nindividual\ninitial\nknitted\nknown\nlarge\nlarge\nlunar\nmale\nmedical\nminute\nmucosal\nnational\nnew\nnormal\noriginal\nother\npresent\nrandom\nrandom\nrandom\nrandom\nrandom\nrandom\nrepresentative\nrepresentative\nrepresentative\nrepresentative\nrepresentative\nrock\nrock\nrock\nselected\nsingle\nsmall\nsmall\nsoil\nsolid\nstratified\nsub\ntissue\ntissue\ntotal sample\ntrade\ntypical\nunrepresentative\nunne\nurine\nurine\nvarious\nwater\nwholein one collocation or learner's dictionary\nin PIE (plural)\nin one bilingual dictionary\nin PIE (singular)\nin more than one collocation or learner's dictionary\nin PIE (singular)\nin PIE (plural)\nmore than once in both bilingual dictionaries\nin PIE (singular)\nin PIE (singular)\nin PIE (plural)\nin PIE (singular)\nin PIE (plural)\nin PIE (singular)\nin one collocation or learner's dictionary\nin PIE (plural)\nin PIE (plural)\nin PIE (plural)\nin one bilingual dictionary\nin PIE (plural)\nin PIE (plural)\nin PIE (sinqular)\nin PIE (plural)\nin PIE (plural)\nin PIE (singular)\nin PIE (plural)\nin PIE (singular)\nin more than one collocation or learner's dictionary\nin PIE (singular)\nin PIE (plural)\nmore than once in both bilingual dictionaries\nin more than one collocation or learner's dictionary\nin PIE (sinqular)\nin PIE (plural)\nmore than once in both bilingual dictionaries\nin one collocation or learner's dictionary\nmore than once in both bilingual dictionaries\nin PIE (plural)\nin PIE (singular)\nin one collocation or learner's dictionary\nin PIE (singular)\nin one bilingual dictionary\nin PIE (plural)\nin PIE (singular)\nin PIE (singular)\nin one collocation or learner's dictionary\nin one bilingual dictionary\nin PIE (singular)\nin one bilingual dictionary\nin one bilingual dictionary\nin one bilingual dictionary\nin more than one collocation or learner's dictionary\nmore than once in both bilingual dictionaries\nin PIE (plural)\nin one bilingual dictionary\nin PIE (singular)that's a fair sample of... = das ist\nziemlich typisch f\u00fcr...\nGratisprobe\nunverk\u00e4ufliches Muster\nGratisprobe\nProbe\nGratismuster, Gratisprobe\nunverk\u00e4ufliches Muster\n\u00c4rztemuster\nStichprobe\n[Zufalls]stichprobe\nStichprobe\n(sample) repr\u00e4sentativ\nrepr\u00e4sentative Auswahl\nGesteinsprobe\nGesteinsprobe\nBodenprobe\n(MED) Gewebeprobe\nWarenmuster, Warenprobe\nthat's a typical sample of her cooking =\ngenau so kocht sie immer\n(sample) nicht repr\u00e4sentativ\nHamprobe\nUrinprobe\nto take water sample = Wassperoben\nnehmen\nTable 5: The compilation material for the noun sample132\nAll the highlighted collocators in Table 5 are candidates for inclusion since they come\nup at least twice in my sources, i.e. English monolingual collocation dictionaries, an\nEnglish general corpus, and English-German general-purpose comprehensive\ndictionaries searched in their full-text version.\nSince I used the POS search tool (here: adjective + noun) when consulting PIE, I was,\nnaturally, not able to retrieve noun + noun combinations from the British National\nCorpus. Consequently, if the corpus data had confirmed it, also core, soil, trade and\nwater could have found their way into my dictionary. However, the dictionary I have in\nmind, for the purpose of this thesis, is primarily focused on \"real\" adjective + noun\nstructures, even if in English nouns can pre-modify nouns. Still, the material I chose\ngives examples ofthat: blood sample, rock sample, tissue sample and urine sample.\nMy candidates for inclusion were, therefore, biased, blood, clinical, commercial, faecal,\nfree, large, random, representative, rock, small, tissue and urine.\nIn the absence of an English native speaker to consult for the contextual meaning of the\ncollocations, as the next step, I consulted the leading English monolingual learner's\ndictionaries and the British National Corpus18 for reassurance purposes. As Dusan\nGabrovsek (private communication: 2004), a practical lexicographer himself, told me,\nthe reassurance factor is indeed a major issue in practical lexicography, but there are, so\nfar, not many - well, almost no - studies on that matter.\nWhat made me seek reassurance was, clearly, the fact that I had to start from a language\nwhich is not my LI. Consequently, as to the meaning of sample and the collocations it\ncan form, I felt the urge to not only consult English monolingual learner's dictionaries,\nEnglish monolingual dictionaries for native speakers (MW and ODE), but also the\nBritish National Corpus and the Internet itself, as a corpus (via Google search engine).\nOnly armed with this knowledge from dictionaries and corpora was I able to put myself\nin the position of an English learner of German to create the entry.\n! This time through the simple online concordance at http://sara.natcon3.ox.ac.uk/lookup.html [10/12/2004].133\nThen again, when actually translating the English adjective-noun collocations, I did not\nonly consult the (German) corpus of Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache and\ncheck Google (sites in German) for the translation of the combinations which had no\ntranslation equivalent in my first collection (Table 5), but also double-checked the\n'given' translations, which are blood sample, commercial sample, free sample, random\nsample, representative sample, rock sample, tissue sample and urine sample.\nIn addition to the two German corpora (the general one and the German sites on the\nInternet), I also consulted two online dictionaries, DICT.CC and LEO, and, finally, also\nchecked with DUST (the German near-equivalent to a monolingual collocation\ndictionary).\nBesides, whenever 'phrases' (in the sense of extended adjective-noun collocations)\noccurred more than once in the bilingual dictionaries, I took them over but shortened\nthem to a minimum of information, e.g.\na) have a blood sample taken = Blut abgenommen bekommen\nb) taking of a blood sample = Blutentnahme\nc) to go to the doctor to have a blood sample taken = zur Blutentnahme zum Arzt gehen\n=> to have a blood sample taken = Blut abgenommen bekommen\ntaking of a blood sample = Blutentnahme\nThe resulting entry looks like this:\nsample\nbiased verzerrte Stichprobe / Auswahl | clinical klinische Stichprobe\nI free unverk\u00e4ufliches Muster | large gro\u00dfe Auswahl |\nrepresentative repr\u00e4sentative Auswahl, repr\u00e4sentatives Beispiel |\nsmall kleine Auswahl\n\u2022 to have a blood sample taken Blut abgenommen bekommen\n\u2022 blood sample Blutprobe f\n(the) taking of a blood sample Blutentnahme f\ncommercial sample [Warenmuster n\nfaecal sample Kotprobe f\nfree sample Gratismuster n, Gratisprobe f\nrandom sample Stichprobe f\nrock sample Gesteinsprobe (\ntissue sample (MED) Gewebeprobe f\nurine sample Hamprobe (, Urinprobe f\nFig. 53: The entry for sample in an English-German adjective-noun collocation dictionary134\nFor reasons of comparison, and to further enhance my methodology, I compiled the\nentry for remedy along two lines, my corpus-based approach (Fig. 54a) and simple\nretrieval from COLLINS-E and DUOX-E (Fig. 54b).\nremedy\nadequate ad\u00e4quates Mittel | alternative\nalternatives Mittel | appropriate geeignetes Mittel |\ncommon allgemein bekanntes / verbreitetes Mittel\nI desperate \u00e4u\u00dferstes Mittel | drastic PL drastische\nMittel | effective wirksames Mittel | good gutes\nMittel | homoeopathic hom\u00f6opathishes Mittel |\npalliative schmerzstillendes Mittel | proposed\nvorgeschlagene L\u00f6sung | simple einfaches Mittel |\nsure sicheres / zuverl\u00e4ssiges Mittel | traditional\ntraditionelles / herk\u00f6mmliches Mittel | unfailing\nunfehlbares Mittel | universal unversales /\nuniverselles Mitel | usual \u00fcbliches Mittel\nto take Bach's flower remedy (MED) eine\nBachbl\u00fctentherapie machen\nthe best remedy for das beste Mittel gegen / f\u00fcr\na cold remedy ein Mittel gegen Erk\u00e4ltung\na desparate disease requires a dangerous I\ndrastic remedy (fig.) extreme Situationen erfordern\nextreme Ma\u00dfnahmen\nto apply drastic remedies (lit.) drastische Mittel\nergreifen, (fig.) mit eisernem Besen kehren\ncivil remedy (JUR) Rechtsbehelf n, Rechtsmittel m\ncough remedy Hustenmittel n\ncontractual remedy Vertragsentsch\u00e4digung f\nfolk remedy Volksmittel n\nlegal remedy (JUR) Rechtsbehelf n, Rechtsmittel m\ndrastic I kill-or-cure remedy Radikalkur f, Rosskur\nf\nherbal remedies PL Kr\u00e4uterheilmittel n\nhome I household remedy Hausmittel n\njudicial (JUR) Rechtsbehelf n, Rechtsmittel m\nnatural remedy (medication) Naturheilmittel n, (thempy)\nNaturheilverfahren n\npatent remedy (in. a. fig.)

Obviously, the corpus-based approach starting from the English\ncollocation and learner's dictionaries has outdone the best-bilingual-dictionary approach\nby 13:4 in the first section alone.135\nExcept for the first adjective collocator, diuretic, which is rather specialised, I wonder\nwhy either of the bilingual dictionaries lists helpful remedy, speedy remedy and useless\nremedy while these combinations are not to be found in the British National Corpus, nor\nthe learner's dictionaries and the collocation dictionaries.\nNot adhering to my clear policy, I would, judging from Fig. 54b and Fig. 54a,\ninclude/exclude these combinations for the following reasons:\nCOLLOCATOR\ndiurectic\nhelpful\nspeedy\nuseless\nflu\nrecuperative\nrough and effective\nsovereignINCLUSION\nX\nXEXCLUSION\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nXREASON\ntoo specific\nthe English user could look for adequate,\nappropriate and effective\nnone of the collocations listed indicates\ninstant cure 1 solution\nnone of the collocations listed indicates\nineffective cure 1 solution\ncan be derived from cold remedy and\ncough remedy as Mittel gegen Grippe or\nGrippemittel\na pleonasm for me (a remedy for\nremedy)\ncan be derived from drastic / kill-or-cure\nremedy as Radikalkur and Rosskur skur\ncan be derived from patent / universal\nremedy as Allheilmittlel, Patentl\u00f6sung,\nPatentrezept and Spezialrezept.\nTable 6: Possible reasons for inclusion and exclusion\nAs a result, the 6:2 decision can be taken as a clear confirmation of my methodology,\nalthough other reasons might be suggested, e.g. extralinguistic and psychological ones\nsuch as reassurance.\nThe alert reader might have realised that my encoding collocation dictionary actually\nalso includes semantically and predictable collocations, e.g. adequate remedy =\nad\u00e4quates Mittel and homoeopathic remedy = hom\u00f6opatisches Mittel.\nBahns (1993) and Gabrovsek (1998a/b and 2000) suggest that the overwhelming\nnumber of collocations be best dealt with in contrastive terms, i.e. that the focus should136\nbe only on semantically unpredictable and structurally incongruent ones. Still, in my\nrestricted framework, in the specialised sector of adjective-noun collocations, I opted\nfor inclusion of all the collocations my corpus-based approaches suggested since we, the\nlexicographers, should never leave aside the reassurance factor on the part of the\ndictionary user - and if the information is there, why leave it out?\nIt goes without saying that in a broader framework, i.e. a general-purpose bilingual\ncollocation dictionary, this decision might be disputable, at least for the print versions\n(where space is constrained) as opposed to an electronic version.\nSo, in Chapter 6, I will deal with the question of whether it is realistic to further and\nexpand the research work along the lines I took and if yes, in which way. Furthermore, I\nwill recapitulate the main points of this thesis.137\n6. Further Implications and Conclusions\nWith this thesis I have endeavoured to demonstrate the need for a bilingual collocation\ndictionary. Collocations are recurrent, usage- rather than semantically based word\ncombinations. Yet, \"the notion of conventional syntagms [collocation] finds its full\ndimension only when it is considered contrastively, i.e. when the native language of the\nlearner [or the translator] and his target language are taken into consideration. Real ...\nproblems are caused by these syntagms which are comparatively speaking, lexically\nnon-congruent, or, in other words, by those in which there is no direct translational\nequivalence between their corresponding elements.\" (Marton 1977: 40-41).\nSince collocations are passwords to native-like fluency in a foreign language (Cop\n1991: 2776), and although an incorrect or unacceptable collocation may be still\nunderstood by the native speaker, it might cause laughter or even annoyance.\nCollocational errors should thus be minimised in translation and advanced writing in\nparticular. This is why advanced learners and translators are the main target user groups\nof a collocation dictionary.\nIn Chapter 1 I outlined my current line of study which focuses on the lexicographical\ntreatment of the translation of adjective-noun collocations from English into German. I\ntested the four major comprehensive English-German dictionaries on the market and\npointed out the current drawbacks in general bilingual lexicography (cf. I.3.).\nAdditionally, I called attention to the fact that there are today very few monolingual and\nhardly any bilingual collocation dictionaries available (cf. I.3., 1.5. and Chapter 4).\nRight from the beginning I suggested what a bilingual adjective-noun collocation\ndictionary should look like to be of maximum use to the English learner of German or\nthe English-to-German translator.\nBefore embarking on a discussion of collocations in the contrastive light, in Chapter 3,1\noutlined major approaches to and applications to of the concept of collocation in\nChapter 2. I started with an overview of the different interpretations as seen from the\nhistorical angle and discussed the major research areas and the work done by the138\npractitioners in the field of collocation studies. Particularly, I dealt with corpus\nlinguistics and its merits for collocation research, also sketching out the contributions of\ncomputational linguistics to collocational analysis. In section 2.3. I showed where the\nconcept of collocation is to be placed within the wider framework of contemporary\nmainstream phraseology and other branches of linguistics.\nThe focus of Chapter 3 was on collocations regarded in the interlingual, English-\nGerman, light. The result of two case studies further enhanced the need for a bilingual\ncollocation dictionary and highlighted the necessity of a better lexicographical or\ncomputational treatment, i.e. in machine translation, of collocations in the modern\nscience of information retrieval.\nIn the opening sections of Chapter 4 I discussed several general and specialised English\nmonolingual collocation dictionaries, one monolingual German dictionary with a\nsignificant collocational component and some bilingual collocation dictionaries,\nincluding two works in the English-German field. I went on to outline the principles of\nbilingual lexicography and assessed the collocational treatment in existing bilingual\ndictionaries.\nFinally, Chapter 5 was dedicated to three different methodologies of compiling an\nEnglish-German adjective-noun collocation dictionary. I compared two different\ncorpus-driven methods, viz. making use of parts of speech and a purely statistical one,\nwith my own corpus-based approach. In section 5.2., I described my technique of\ncreating the dictionary I have in mind with an illustrative sample entry. The 16 entries I\ncompiled for the purpose of this thesis can be found, together with the user's guide and\nan index of German nouns in the back matter, in Appendix D.\nThere yet remains the question of whether widening the scope of my research is indeed\nrealistic in terms of both lexicographical and computational perspectives.\nAs can be seen from the sample entries of an English-German adjective-noun\ncollocation dictionary, a lot of adjective-noun structures are embedded in structures\nwhere it is only the added word, e.g. a verb or a noun, which gives the combination its\nfull contextual meaning, e.g. scientific basis = wissenschaftliche Grundlage, to put a139\nprocedure on a scientific basis = eine Prozedur verwissenschaftlichen and to approach\na problem on a scientific basis = an ein Problem wissenschaftlich herangehen.\nThis finding reveals that it would indeed make sense to widen the scope of my research\nand compile a general-purpose collocation dictionary, including not only adjective-noun\nstructures but also nouns and their verb collocators, etc.\nGiven the fact that only about 75% of the English adjective-noun collocations tested can\nbe reliably translated with the help of all four major English-German dictionaries on the\nmarket (cf. 3.5.1), I am convinced that the figures would look similar in verbal\ncollocations.\nA detailed investigation into this is yet to be made; however, a full-text search for\nremedy and its verbal collocators in COLLINS-E and DUOX-E resulted in five\ncollocations: to find a remedy, to apply drastic remedies, to take Bachs flower remedy,\nto think up a remedy and to devise a remedy - two of which have found their way into\nmy adjective-noun dictionary.\nAccording to OCD, remedy can enter into collocations with 21 verbs:\n1. (= cure) to take a remedy, to use a remedy, to give somebody a remedy, to prescribe\nsomebody a remedy, to prepare a remedy, to find a remedy; a remedy is available and a\nremedy works\n2. (= way of dealing with a problem) to have a problem, to pursue a remedy, to seek a\nremedy, to resort to a remedy, to exhaust a remedy, to create a remedy, to offer a\nremedy, to afford somebody a remedy, to grant somebody a remedy, to provide\nsomebody with a remedy; a remedy is available and a remedy lies in something\nRoughly one quarter of the verbal collocations of remedy are covered by the bilingual\ndictionaries. Furthermore, only one collocation, to find a remedy, is listed in the entry\nfor the noun remedy in COLLINS-E (while it is in the entry for Abhilfe [= action to\nimprove matters] in DUOX-E). The other four noun-verb collocations are listed in\nGerman entries, which would therefore take the English user a lot of effort to find in the\nprint version.140\nThe methodology I tested for the compilation of an English-German adjective-noun\ncollocation dictionary can be easily extended to cover also verbal collocations; the only\nchange that would have to be made is information retrieval from the corpora since you\ncan no longer look for sequences of adjacent words or simply query for parts of speech.\nIn contrast, you would have to either stick to parsed corpora or use statistical\nsignificance measures like the MI- or t-score (cf. 2.5.).\nLikewise, with the help of an English native speaker, my method can also be\nimplemented for an encoding German into English part.\nFinally, what are the chances for such a dictionary to be actually produced? As already\npointed out before (cf. p. 110), first of all, the headwords to be included in the\ndictionary have to be carefully selected. Second, one should think of the publication of a\nbilingual collocation dictionary along either of two lines. The methodology can either\nbe fully implemented in the compilation process of a general bilingual dictionary, both\nprint and electronic version, or the dictionary is to be produced, although in co-\noperation with a publishing house, as a stand-alone work.\nIn very realistic terms I see a bilingual collocation dictionary compiled along the\nmethodology I proposed within this thesis as an additional feature in the electronic\nversions of comprehensive general bilingual dictionaries. The user would be able to\nconsult the bilingual dictionary in the usual manner and would, upon finding the entry,\nhave the option to click on the bilingual collocation section that goes with the\nheadword. A pop-up window would then show entries similar to the ones I compiled for\nthis thesis. In full-text search, the collocational information would, naturally, also be\nincluded.\nIn the end, let me emphasize once again that collocations are passwords to native-like\nfluency and collocational correctness is indispensable, especially in translation and\nother written tasks and we, as lexicographers, should provide the users with the\ninformation they need in the best possible way. Let us, therefore, pay tribute to all those\nwho have furthered collocation studies in all their possible applications.141\n7.

Manche Menschen m\u00f6gen\nes, wenn drau\u00dfen ein Sturm tobt. Eigentlich ziehen sie sogar einen tobenden Sturm\neiner angenehmen Brise vor. Sogar st\u00fcrmischer Wind ist nicht genug. Starker Regen\nmuss es sein, nicht stellenweise Regen. Str\u00f6mender Regen und b\u00f6iger Wind. Das Kind\nwird einen Regenschirm kaufen, obwohl es nicht in Str\u00f6men gie\u00dft. Es regnet nicht\nschon seit Wochen ohne Unterbrechung. Kein Regenschauer, kein Dauerregen. Nur\nstellenweise Regen. Eine dicke Regenwolke ist eine Seltenheit. Es gibt keine\nwolkenbruchartigen Schauer, keinen str\u00f6menden Regen. Eisiger Wind bl\u00e4st nur im\nHerbst. Manchmal gibt es auch schwere St\u00fcrme. Wenn drau\u00dfen ein Sturm tobt, bleiben\ndie Leute zu Hause und beobachten den st\u00fcrmischen Wind, den b\u00f6igen Wind und den\nstarken Regen. Eigentlich m\u00f6gen sie beides, einen tobenden Sturm und eine angenehme\nBrise. Die Frau war am Strand, obwohl es in Str\u00f6men goss. Es regnete schon seit\nMittwoch ohne Unterbrechung. Es war kein Regenschauer, sondern Dauerregen. Eine\ndicke Regenwolke hing \u00fcber der Stadt. Sogar die Hunde fl\u00fcchteten vor dem\nwolkenbruchartigen Schauer. Ein eisiger Wind blies von Westen her. Ein schlechtes\nZeichen, denn der Wetterbericht sagte schwere St\u00fcrme in dieser Gegend voraus.\nManche Menschen m\u00f6gen es nicht, wenn drau\u00dfen ein Sturm tobt, sie ziehen eine\nangenehme Brise einem tobenden Sturm vor. Sie hassen st\u00fcrmischen Wind und starken\nRegen. Stellenweise Regen ist in Ordnung, aber nicht str\u00f6mender Regen und b\u00f6iger\nWind.\nENGLISH: The man is in the garden although it is pouring with rain. It's been raining\nsolidly since Thursday now. It's not a rain shower, but steady rain. A thick rain cloud is\nhanging over the village. Even the cats flee from the torrential rain. An icy wind blows172\nfrom the north. A bad sign. The weather forecast is for severe gales. Some people like it\nwhen it is blowing a gale outside, they actually prefer a fierce gale to a pleasant breeze.\nEven blustery wind is not enough. It has to be heavy rain not patchy rain. Pouring rain\nand gusty wind. The child will buy an umbrella although it isn't pouring with rain. It\nhas not been raining solidly for weeks now. No rain shower, no steady rain. Only patchy\nrain. A thick rain cloud is a rarity. There is no torrential rain, no pouring rain. Icy wind\nonly blows in autumn. Sometimes there are even severe gales. When it is blowing a gale\noutside, people stay at home and watch the blustery wind, the gusty wind and the heavy\nrain. They actually like both, a fierce gale and a pleasant breeze. The woman was on the\nbeach although it was pouring with rain. It had been raining solidly since Wednesday. It\nwasn't a rain shower, but steady rain. A thick rain cloud hung over the town. Even the\ndogs fled from the torrential rain. An icy wind blew from the west. A bad sign. The\nweather forecast was for severe gales in this region. Some people don't like it when it is\nblowing a gale outside, they prefer a pleasant breeze to a fierce gale. They hate blustery\nwind and heavy rain. Patchy rain is okay, but not pouring rain and gusty wind.\n(2) Aligned and Annotated Parallel Corpus\nADJ\nADV\nARTDEF\nARTIND\nDEMPRO\nINF\nKONNEB\nKONUNTadjective\nadverb\ndefinite article\nindefinite article\ndemonstrative pronoun\ninfinitive\nco-ordinating conjunction\nsubordinating conjunctionPERPRO\nPROIND\nPRP\nSUB\nSZE\nSZK\nVER\nVERAUXpersonal pronoun\nindefinite pronoun\npreposition\nnoun\nsentence end\npunctuation = comma\nverb\nauxiliary verb\n1. derARTDEF Mann_SUB sein_VERAUX im_PRP GartenSUB ,_SZK\nobwohlKONUNT ichPERPRO inPRP Str\u00f6menSUB gie\u00dfenVER .SZE\n2. ich_PERPRO regnenVER jetztADV schonADV seit_PRP DonnerstagSUB\nohnePRP UnterbrechungSUB .SZE\n3. ichPERPRO seinVERAUX keinPROIND Regenschauer_SUB ,_SZK\nsondernJCONNEB DauerregenSUB .SZE173\n4. ein_ARTIND dick_ADJ Regenwolke_SUB h\u00e4ngenVER \u00fcberPRP derARTDEF\nDorfSUB ._SZE\n5. sogarADV derARTDEF Katze_SUB fl\u00fcchtenVER vorPRP derARTDEF\nwolkenbruchartigerADJ SchauerSUB ._SZE\n6. einARTIND eisig_ADJ WindSUB blasen_VER vonPRP NordenSUB\nher_ADV ._SZE\n7. ein_ARTIND schlechtADJ ZeichenSUB ,_SZK denn_KONNEB derARTDEF\nWetterbericht_SUB sagenVER schwer_ADJ SturmSUB voraus_ADV .SZE\n8. manchPROIND MenschSUB m\u00f6genVERMOD ichPERPRO ,_SZK\nwennKONUNT drau\u00dfenADV einARTIND SturmSUB toben_VER .SZE\neigentlichADV ziehenVER ich_PERPRO sogarADV einARTIND tobendADJ\nSturmSUB einARTIND angenehmADJ BriseSUB vorADV .SZE\n9. sogarADV st\u00fcrmisch_ADJ WindSUB seinVERAUX nichtADV genugADV\n._SZE\n10. stark_ADJ Regen_SUB muss_VERMOD ich_PERPRO sein_VERINF ,_SZK\nnichtADV stellenweiseADV RegenSUB ._SZE\n11. str\u00f6mendADJ RegenSUB undKONNEB b\u00f6igADJ WindSUB .SZE\n12. der_ARTDEF Kind_SUB werden_VERAUX ein_ARTIND Regenschirm_SUB\nkaufen_VERINF ,_SZK obwohlKONUNT ich_PERPRO nicht_ADV in PRP\nStr\u00f6menSUB gie\u00dfenVER .SZE\n13. ich_PERPRO regnen_VER nicht_ADV schon_ADV seit_PRP Woche_SUB\nohne_PRP UnterbrechungSUB .SZE\n14. keinPROIND Regenschauer_SUB ,_SZK keinPROIND DauerregenSUB .SZE\n15. nur_ADV stellenweiseADV RegenSUB ._SZE\n16. einARTIND dickADJ Regenwolke_SUB seinVERAUX einARTIND\nSeltenheitSUB ._SZE\n17. ichPERPRO geben_VER keinPROIND wolkenbruchartigerADJ SchauerSUB\n,_SZK kein_PROIND str\u00f6mendADJ Regen_SUB .SZE\n18. eisig_ADJ Wind_SUB blasen_VER nurADV im_PRP Herbst_SUB ._SZE\n19. manchmal_ADV gebenVER ichPERPRO auchADV schwerADJ SturmSUB\n._SZE\n20. wennKONUNT drau\u00dfenADV einARTIND Sturm_SUB toben_VER ,_SZK\nbleiben VER der ARTDEF Leute SUB zu PRP Haus SUB und KONNEB174\nbeobachtenVER derARTDEF st\u00fcrmischADJ WindSUB ,_SZK derARTDEF\nb\u00f6ig_ADJ Wind_SUB und_KONNEB der_ARTDEF stark_ADJ RegenSUB ._SZE\n21.eigentlich_ADV m\u00f6genVERMOD ichPERPRO beideDEMPRO ,_SZK\neinARTIND tobendADJ SturmSUB und_KONNEB einARTIND\nangenehm_ADJ BriseSUB ._SZE\n22. derARTDEF Frau_SUB sein_VERAUX am_PRP Strand_SUB ,_SZK\nobwohlKONUNT ichPERPRO inPRP Str\u00f6menSUB gie\u00dfenVER .SZE\n23. ich_PERPRO regnenVER schonADV seitPRP MittwochSUB ohnePRP\nUnterbrechungSUB ._SZE\n24. ichPERPRO seinVERAUX keinPROIND RegenschauerSUB ,_SZK\nsondernKONNEB DauerregenSUB ._SZE\n25. einARTIND dickADJ RegenwolkeSUB h\u00e4ngenVER \u00fcberPRP derARTDEF\nStadt_SUB ._SZE\n26. sogar_ADV der_ARTDEF Hund_SUB fl\u00fcchtenVER vor_PRP derARTDEF\nwolkenbruchartiger_ADJ SchauerSUB .SZE\n27. ein_ARTIND eisig_ADJ Wind_SUB blasen_VER vonPRP Westen_SUB\nherADV ._SZE\n28. einARTIND schlechtADJ ZeichenSUB ,_SZK dennKONNEB derARTDEF\nWetterberichtSUB sagenVER schwerADJ SturmSUB in_PRP\ndieserDEMPRO GegendSUB vorausADV .SZE\n29. manchPROIND MenschSUB m\u00f6genVERMOD ichPERPRO nichtADV\n,_SZK wennKONUNT drau\u00dfen_ADV einARTIND SturmSUB tobenVER\n,_SZK ichPERPRO ziehen_VER einARTIND angenehmADJ BriseSUB\neinARTIND tobend_ADJ Sturm_SUB vorADV ._SZE\n30. ichPERPRO hassenVER sturmisch_ADJ WindSUB und_KONNEB starkADJ\nRegen_SUB .SZE\n31.

The\nnouns are a random sample taken from the\nintersection of Michael West's General\nService List (1953), the Longman Defining\nVocabulary (1987) and M.L Hayes's (1999)\nlist of nouns frequently used in academic\nwriting: basis, collection, comparison,\ncondition, content, discovery, discussion,\nexamination, framework, mechanism,\npopulation, principle, proposal, remedy,\nsample and tendency.\nThe collocators of the headwords are a\nselection from existing collocation\ndictionaries (BBI, LTP and OCD) and the\nfour major English monolingual learner's\ndictionaries (COBUILD, LDOCE, MAC and\nOALD). All collocations were checked\nagainst the British National Corpus.\nThe German translations are taken from\ntwo of the most comprehensive English-\nGerman dictionaries on the market\n(COLUNS-E and DUOX-E), online\ndictionaries like LEO and DICT.CC and are\nbacked up by corpus data from Digitales\nW\u00f6rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache.\nThe lexicographer is a native speaker of\nGerman.\nPurpose of the dictionary\nThis dictionary is primarily intended for\nEnglish advanced learners of German or\nEnglish-to-German translators. With the\nhelp of a collocation dictionary like this not\nonly common collocational errors can be\navoided but also native-like fluency in\nspeech and writing can be made easier.User's Guide\nAdjective collocators are listed in their base\nnoun entries. The headwords are printed in\nbold face and are bigger than the rest of the\nentry.\nEach entry is divided into a maximum of\nfour sections which are marked by square\nbullet points:\n(1) English adjective-noun collocations with\na German adjective-noun representation:\nOn the English side only the adjectives are\nlisted (they are printed in bold), while on the\nGerman side the collocation as a whole is\nrepresented. To help the user German\nadjectives are inflected according to the\ngender of the following noun. The English\nadjectives are listed alphabetically. If, on\nthe German side, there are several\nequivalent collocations, these are ordered\nalphabetically first by the noun then by the\nadjective.\n(2) English adjective-noun collocations that\nare rendered into German with a different\nstructure are listed in this section of the\nentry (they are listed alphabetically\naccording to the adjective collocator). Often\na verb or other word class items have to be\nadded to give the collocation its correct\ncontextual meaning in both languages.\nSuch English 'phrases' are printed in bold\nitalics, while the German translation is set in\nnormal type.\n(3) English adjective-noun collocations\nforming a part of a pattern, e.g.\nprepositional phrase: The full pattern is\nlisted (in alphabetical order of the\ncollocators) together with its German\ntranslation equivalents. Again, English\n'phrases' are printed in bold italics.\n(4) In this section the user finds English\nadjective-noun collocations with are\nrendered into German as 'authentic\ncompounds', that is, word combinations that\nare spelled as single words, as well as178\nGerman simplex words. English\ncombinations are printed in bold italics and\nare put in alphabetical order according to\nthe collocators. German translations are\nfollowed by their grammatical gender.\nGerman collocations phrases and\ncompounds are normally unmarked, so\nlabels (preceding the German translation)\nindicate a special register or style. When\nthe German number differs from the English\none, this is also marked by a preceding\nlabel. These labels are listed in the\nabbreviations section.\nEntries are normally not subdivided into\ndifferent senses when the German\ntranslations reflect the English uses(although an English headword might have\ndifferent German translation equivalents). In\nlonger entries, where it is possible to divide\nthe German translations into different\nsenses, this is done for the benefit of the\nuser.\nWhen needed for a particular translation,\nsense discriminators are added in italics in\nround brackets.\nIn the back matter of the dictionary there is\na list of German nouns (included are also\nnouns from sections 2-4).\nSample Entryheadword (noun base) 1\nEN-GE\nadjective-noun\nsection\nsection\nmarker\nEN adjective-noun\ncollocations which\nare rendered into\nGE as compounds\nor simplex wordscomparison\nappropriate schlagender / sehr \u00fcberzeugender\nVergleich | apt passender / treffender Vergleich | close ^\neingehender / genauer Vergleich | detailed detaillierter /\neingehender Vergleich | direct direkter Vergleich | fair\nfairer / gerechter Vergleich | far-fetched gek\u00fcnstelter /\ngesuchter / weithergeholter Vergleich | favourable\nVorteilhafte Gegen\u00fcberstellung, vorteilhafter Vergleich\ngood guter Vergleich | inept unangemessener /\nungeeignter / unpassender Vergleich | invidious\nunfairer / ungerechter / unpassender Vergleich |\nmeaningful aussagekr\u00e4ftiger / sinnvoller Vergleich j\nsimple einfacher Vergleich | systematic systematischer\nVergleich | unfair unfairer / ungerechter Vergleich |\nunfavourable nachteiliger Vergleich | useful\nbrauchbarer / praktischer Vergleich | valid treffender\nVergleich\n\u2022 you couldni have made a more apt comparison\nman h\u00e4tte es nicht treffender vergleichen k\u00f6nnen;\nthis is a feeble I misleading I poor comparison der\nVergleich hinkt\nto make a point by point comparison etwas Punkt\nf\u00fcr Punkt vergleichen\ntextual comparison vergleichende\nGegen\u00fcberstellung von Texten\nprice comparison Preisvergleich m\ntextual comparison (TECHNJ Synopse fEN collocatorJ\ndifferent GE\ntranslation\nequivalents with\ninflected\nadjectives\nEN adjective-\nnoun\ncollocations or\nphrases with a\ndifferent GE\nstructure\nAbbreviations\na.\nBIOL\nBUS\nCHEM\nCOMPUT\nCONSTR\nderog.\nfig-\nform.and\nbiology\nbusiness\nchemistry\ncomputer science\nconstruction\nderogatory\nfigurative\nfonvalinf.\nJUR\nLIBR\nLING\nlit.\nLOGIC\nMED\nMIL\nPHYSinformal\njurisprudence\nlibrary science\nlinguistics\nliteral\nlogic\nmedicine\nmilitary\nphysicsPL\nPOL\nPSYCH\nSG\nSOCIOL\nSPORT\nTECHN\nUNIV\nusu.plural\npolitics\npsychology\nsingular\nsociology\nsports\ntechnology\nuniversity\nusually179\nbasis\nbroad breite Basis | firm feste Basis / Grundlage,\nstabile Basis | scientific wissenschaftliche Grundlage\nI sound solide / gesunde Basis | theoretical\ntheoretische Grundlage\n\u2022 to work on a casual basis Gelegenheitsarbeiter\nsein\nto have a factual basis auf Tatsachen beruhen\nto have no firm /sound basis (fig.) auf wackeligen\nF\u00fcllen stehen\nto work on a commission basis auf Provisions-/\nProzentbasis arbeiten, gegen Provision arbeiten\nto put something on a different basis etwas auf\neine neue Grundlage stellen\nto be engaged on a part-time basis to teach\nFrench als Teilzeitlehrer/-in f\u00fcr Franz\u00f6sisch\nangestellt sein /arbeiten\nto be employed on a permanent I regular basis\nfest angestellt sein\nto do something on a professional basis etwas\n[hauptberuflich machen / betreiben\nto do something on a rota basis sich abl\u00f6sen,\netwas abwechelnd machen\nto approach a problem on a scientific basis an\nein Problem wissenschaftlich herangehen\nto put a procedure on a scientific basis ein\nVerfahren verwissenschaftlichen\nto meet with someone on a social basis mit\njemandem au\u00dferdienstlich verkehren\nto be on a sound basis (business) auf festen F\u00fc\u00dfen\nstehen, (theory) auf einer soliden Basis ruhen\nto help out on a temporary basis als Aushilfe\narbeiten\nto be employed on a trial basis auf Probe,\nprobehalber/,-weise besch\u00e4ftigt sein\nHow does it average out on a weekly basis?
