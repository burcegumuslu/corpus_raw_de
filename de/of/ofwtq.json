The art of the\n[vaccine](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccine/) researcher lies in finding substances that prevent us from falling ill with diseases such as [influenza](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/influenza/) or viral [hepatitis](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/hepatitis/). But what makes a [vaccine](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccine/) successful and ensures effective protection? Our scientists study the reaction of the [immune system](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/immune-system/) to answer that question \u2013 and to develop better [vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/) strategies.\nLeader\nOur Research\nThe use of vaccines is the most effective and inexpensive approach to promote protection against infectious diseases. Our vaccinologists are developing new vaccines, which can serve either as a\n[prophylaxis](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/prophylaxis/) or as a therapy against infections.\nIn order to achieve this goal, the scientists try to understand the\n[host](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/host/) response mechanisms triggered by an [infection](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/infection/) or a [vaccine](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccine/) in different subpopulation groups.\nA strong immune response is not sufficient by itself for the success of the\n[vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/). The immune reaction must also fit well terms of effector mechanisms needed to achieve protection. How such a suitable response looks like can be learned from patients, who successfully combat an [infection](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/infection/) after triggering the appropriate effector mechanisms. Thus, the search begins at the hospital.\nOur researchers also look for key new clinical markers that reveal how the patients\u2019\n[immune system](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/immune-system/) responds to the pathogen attack or to a [vaccine](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccine/) in order to predict for [vaccine](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccine/) efficacy and safety.\nWithin the last years the safety requirements for vaccines increased. Therefore, the so-called subunit vaccines were developed which consists only of selected\n[antigens](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/antigens/) of a certain pathogen, instead of the whole pathogen itself. The disadvantage is that the immune response induced by these subunit vaccines is often not strong enough. Hence, excipients, so called adjuvants, need to be added. Our researchers identified promising adjuvants that promote the immune response and, in addition, allow its modulation and optimization. This will facilitate the development of a tailored [vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/) strategy for each pathogen.\nA successful\n[vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/) strategy also includes the safe and simple delivery of the vaccines. The vision of our researchers: no longer to inject vaccines, but delivering them instead by a needle-free noninvasive approach. In this regard most of the pathogens attack the mucosal membranes. Thus, mucosal [vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/) strategies, such as via a nasal spray or sublingual can stimulate the local mucosal [immune system](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/immune-system/). As a result, the [host](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/host/) develops local defensive mechanisms against the pathogen in the mucosal tissues as well as effector cells that disseminate throughout the entire body conferring protection. Special about this [vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/) strategy is that already the entering of the pathogen via mucosal membranes can be blocked and the [infection](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/infection/) be prevented. In case of the conventional [vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/) with a needle, no immune response at the mucosal membranes is induced and pathogens can still enter the body before the immune reaction starts (i.e. individuals might be protected against disease but they can still transfer the agent to other susceptible hosts).\nWhether the\n[vaccine](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccine/) is delivered via syringe or nasal spray \u2013 the development of any new [vaccine](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccine/) requires extensive and prolonged research, including test series in preclinical models. However, despite of the high genetic similarity between animals and men, there are significant differences in the immune responses. For example, a [vaccine](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccine/) which is successful in mice will not always be successful in humans. Thus, in order to increase the transferability of the obtained data into the human situation and to shorten the protracted and cost-intensive research phase vaccinologists develop new strategies. To this end, they evolve animal models based on mice which possess a humanized [immune system](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/immune-system/). With this approach the research turns full circle: we return to the clinic. But this time not for the purpose of examining sick patients, but to prevent new illnesses.\nNews\nBachelor & Master\nAre you interested in a bachelor or master thesis?

Bislang gibt es keinen ausreichend wirksamen Impfstoff gegen das Mycobacterium tuberkulosis, lediglich einen, der S\u00e4uglinge in den ersten zwei Lebensjahren sch\u00fctzt. Jetzt kristallisiert sich in klinischen Studien ein vielversprechender neuer Impfstoff heraus, den die Vakzine Projekt Management GmbH auf ihrem Weg zur Zulassung begleitet. Bernd Eisele und Leander Grode stellen Ihnen den Impfstoff vor und berichten von ihren Hoffnungen und Erwartungen\u2026\n- Turbo f\u00fcr die Impfung \u2013 neue Hilfsstoffe erm\u00f6glichen neue Impfmethoden Sie habe einen schlechten Ruf, aber ohne sie geht nichts: Impfverst\u00e4rker. Seit es Impfungen gibt, brauchen Impfstoff die Unterst\u00fctzung kleiner Molek\u00fcle. Thomas Ebensen und Rimma Libanova haben einen vielversprechenden Impfturbo entdeckt \u2013 der ganz nebenbei die gesamte Impftechnik revolutionieren k\u00f6nnte. Kommen Sie mit...\n- Influenza zwischen Schwein und Mensch - die Experten Klaus Schughart und Carlos Guzman im Gespr\u00e4ch Die Influenzawelle rollt, aber die Informationen \u00fcber Schweinegrippe, saisonale Grippe und die verschiedenen Impfstoffe sind verwirrend - teilweise be\u00e4ngstigend. Soll ich mich impfen lassen? Sind die Impfstoffe sicher? Mein Nachbar kennt aber jemanden... Die Grippe ist doch gar nicht so schlimm... Sind Sie ebenfalls unsicher? Dann lassen Sie sich die wichtigsten Fragen von unseren Experten des Helmholtz-Zentrums f\u00fcr Infektionsforschung f\u00fcr Influenza Klaus Schughart und Carlos Guzman beantworten...\n- SchnupfimpfungImpfen ohne Spritze. Darauf warten nicht nur Spritzen-Phobiker. Nasensprays sollen in Zukunft das Impfen revolutionieren. Doch es gibt ein gro\u00dfes Problem: Der Impfstoff muss zuerst durch die wehrhafte Schleimhaut, um zu seinem Ziel zu gelangen.\n[Send per
