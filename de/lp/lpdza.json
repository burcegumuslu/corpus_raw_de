Anthroposophic therapy includes special medicinal products, artistic therapies, eurythmy movement exercises, and special physical thera-pies. The Anthroposophic Medicine Outcomes Study (AMOS) was a pro-spective observational multicenter study of 1631 outpatients starting anthroposophic therapy for anxiety disorders, asthma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, low back pain, migraine, and other chronic indications under routine conditions in Germany. \nAMOS incorporated two fea-\ntures proposed for the evaluation of integrative therapy systems: (1) a sequential approach, starting with the whole therapy system (use, safe-ty, outcomes, perceived benefit), addressing comparative effective-ness and proceeding to the major system components (physician counseling, anthroposophic medici-nal products, art therapy, eurythmy therapy, rhythmical massage thera-py) and (2) a mix of different research methods to build an information synthesis, including pre-post analy-ses, prospective comparative analy-ses, economic analyses, and safety analyses of individual patient data. AMOS fostered two methodological innovations for the analysis of single-arm therapy studies (combined bias suppression, systematic outcome comparison with corresponding cohorts in other studies) and the first depression cost analysis worldwide comparing primary care patients treated for depression vs depressed patients treated for another disorder vs nondepressed patients.\nA total of 21 peer-reviewed pub-\nlications from AMOS have resulted. This article provides an overview of the main research questions, meth-ods, and findings from these publica-tions: anthroposophic treatment was safe and was associated with clinical-ly relevant improvements in symp-toms and quality of life without cost increase; improvements were found in all age, diagnosis, and therapy modality groups and were retained at 48-month follow-up; nonrespondent bias, natural recovery, regression to the mean, and adjunctive therapies together could explain a maximum of 37% of the improvement.\n\u6458\u8981\n\u4eba\u667a\u533b\u5b66\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531 Rudolf Steiner \u548c Ita Wegman \u5efa\u7acb\u3001\u7531\u533b\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u8865\u5145\u6cbb\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002 \u4eba\u667a\u6cbb\u7597\u5305\u62ec\u7279\u6b8a\u533b\u836f\u4ea7\u54c1\u3001\u827a\u672f\u7597\u6cd5\u3001\u97f3\u8bed\u821e\u8fd0\u52a8\u953b\u70bc\u548c\u7279\u6b8a\u7269\u7406\u7597\u6cd5\u3002 \u4eba\u667a\u533b\u5b66\u7ed3\u679c\u7814\u7a76 (AMOS) \u662f\u4e00\u9879\u9884\u671f\u7684\u3001\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c2\u5bdf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e3a 1631 \u540d\u5fb7\u56fd\u95e8\u8bca\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u56e0\u7126\u8651\u75c7\u3001\u54ee\u5598\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u7f3a\u9677\u591a\u52a8\u969c\u788d\u3001\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u3001\u8170\u75bc\u3001\u504f\u5934\u75db\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5e38\u89c1\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u6162\u6027\u8ff9\u8c61\u800c\u5f00\u59cb\u63a5\u53d7\u4eba\u667a\u6cbb\u7597\u3002 AMOS \u6574\u5408\u4e86\u62df\u5b9a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u6cbb\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u9879\u7279\u5f81\uff1a (1) \u91c7\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u6574\u4e2a\u6cbb\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u59cb\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u76ca\u5904\uff09\uff0c\u5230\u6bd4\u8f83\u7597\u6548\uff0c\u518d\u5230\u91cd\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u533b\u751f\u54a8\u8be2\u3001\u4eba\u667a\u533b\u836f\u4ea7\u54c1\u3001\u827a\u672f\u7597\u6cd5\u3001\u97f3\u8bed\u821e\u7597\u6cd5\u3001\u8282\u5f8b\u6027\u6309\u6469\u7597\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u5e76 (2) \u878d\u5408\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u7efc\u5408\u4f53\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u524d\u540e\u5206\u6790\u3001\u9884\u671f\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002 AMOS \u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5355\u7ec4\u6cbb\u7597\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e24\u9879\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u521b\u65b0\uff08\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\u907f\u514d\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u76f8\u5e94\u4eba\u7fa4\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5168\u4e16\u754c\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u6210\u672c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5373\u5bf9\u63a5\u53d7\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u62a4\u7406\u60a3\u8005\u3001\u5c31\u53e6\u4e00\u9879\u75be\u75c5\u63a5\u53d7\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u548c\u975e\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002AMOS \u5171\u53d1\u8868\u4e86 21 \u4e2a\u7ecf\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u3002 \u672c\u6587\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u4eba\u667a\u6cbb\u7597\u975e\u5e38\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8d39\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5728\u75c7\u72b6\u548c\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u4ea7\u751f\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6539\u5584\uff1b\u8fd9\u79cd\u6539\u5584\u89c1\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c0f\u7ec4\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301 48 \u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u8ddf\u8fdb\u671f\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u5e94\u7b54\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u6062\u590d\u3001\u8d8b\u5747\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u9644\u52a0\u6cbb\u7597\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u81f3\u591a\u6539\u5584 37%\u3002www.gahmj.com \u2022 January 2014 \u2022 Volume 3, Number 155\n ReviewBACKgROUN d\nAnthroposophic Medicine\nAnthroposophic medicine (AM) is a physician-pro-\nvided whole therapy system, founded in Central Europe \nthe 1920s by Rudolf Steiner and Ita Wegman.1,2 In AM, \nthe methods and insights of conventional medicine are extended by the methods and insights of anthroposo-phy. Anthroposophy (Greek: anthropos = man; sophia = wisdom) was established by Rudolf Steiner\n3 and is \nfounded in three Western traditions: the empirical tradi-tion in the natural sciences from the 17th century onward; the cognitional tradition in philosophy (start-ing with Plato and Aristotle and culminating in the German idealism of the 19th century); and the esoteric tradition in Christian spirituality. Anthroposophy repre-sents a view of man and nature that is spiritual and that also claims to be profoundly scientific.\n4\nAccording to anthroposophy, the human organ-\nism is formed by not only physical (cellular, molecular) forces but by four classes of formative forces, three of which are also found in nature: (1) in minerals, material forces of physicochemical matter; (2) in plants, forma-tive vegetative forces interact with material forces, bringing about and maintaining the living form; (3) in animals with sensory and motor systems and with a corresponding inner life, a further class of formative forces (anima, soul) interact with material and vegeta-\ntive forces; (4) in the human organism with its indi-vidual mind and capacity of thinking, another class of formative forces (Geist, spirit) interact with the materi-\nal, vegetative, and soul forces. The interactions of these forces are understood to vary between different regions and organs in the human organism, resulting in a com-plex equilibrium. This equilibrium can be distorted in various forms of human disease and is sought to be regulated by AM therapies.\n4,5\nAM therapies include special anthroposophic \nmedicinal products (AMPs), nonverbal artistic thera-pies, eurythmy movement exercises, special physio-therapy modalities such as rhythmical massage thera-py, and special nursing techniques.\n1,4 These therapies \nare provided by licensed physicians, nurses, physio-therapists, and other qualified nonmedical therapists (AM art and eurythmy therapy).\n6\nAMPs are prepared from plants, minerals, animals, \nand chemically defined substances. Similar to homeo-pathic products, AMPs can be prepared in homeopath-ic potencies,\na but many AMPs are prepared in concen-\ntrated form.7 AMP therapy differs from homeopathy in \nother aspects as well:\n \u2022The rationale for AMP therapy is based on typo-logical correspondences between pathophysiolog\n-\nical processes in man and formative forces working in minerals, plants, and animals (see above),\n4 while the simile principle of homeopathy \nis based on symptom correspondences8;OVERVIEW  OF THE PUBLICATIONS  FROM  THE ANTHROPOSOPHIC  MEDICINE  OUTCOMES  STUDY\nSINOPSIS\nLa medicina antropos\u00f3fica es un sistema terap\u00e9utico complementar-io proporcionado por el m\u00e9dico que fue fundada por Rudolf Steiner e Ita Wegman. La terapia antropos\u00f3fica incluye productos medicinales especiales, terapias art\u00edsticas, ejerci-cios de movimiento eur\u00edtmico y terapias f\u00edsicas especiales. El estu-dio de los resultados de la medicina antropos\u00f3fica (Anthroposophic Medicine Outcomes Study, AMOS) consisti\u00f3 en un estudio prospectivo observacional multic\u00e9ntrico de 1631 pacientes ambulatorios que comenzaban la terapia antropos\u00f3fi-ca para trastornos de ansiedad, asma, trastorno de hiperactividad y d\u00e9ficit de atenci\u00f3n, depresi\u00f3n, dolor lumbar, migra\u00f1a y otras indicacio-nes cr\u00f3nicas bajo condiciones rutinarias en Alemania. \nAMOS incorporaba dos carac-\nter\u00edsticas propuestas para la evalu-aci\u00f3n de sistemas terap\u00e9uticos inte-grales: (1) un enfoque secuencial, comenzando con el sistema tera-p\u00e9utico completo (uso, seguridad, resultados, ventaja percibida), que aborda la eficacia comparativa y contin\u00faa con los componentes principales del sistema (asesora-miento del m\u00e9dico, productos medicinales antropos\u00f3ficos, terapia art\u00edstica, terapia eur\u00edtmica, terapia de masaje r\u00edtmico) y (2) una combi-naci\u00f3n de diferentes m\u00e9todos de investigaci\u00f3n para crear una s\u00ednte-sis de informaci\u00f3n, que incluye an\u00e1lisis previos y posteriores, an\u00e1li-sis comparativos prospectivos, an\u00e1lisis econ\u00f3micos y an\u00e1lisis de la seguridad de los datos del paciente individual. AMOS fomentaba dos innovaciones metodol\u00f3gicas para el an\u00e1lisis de los estudios terap\u00e9uticos de un grupo \u00fanico (supresi\u00f3n del sesgo combinado, comparaci\u00f3n sistem\u00e1tica de resultados con las cohortes correspondientes en otros estudios) y el primer an\u00e1lisis a nivel mundial del coste de la depresi\u00f3n comparando pacientes de atenci\u00f3n primaria tratados de depresi\u00f3n frente a pacientes deprimidos trata-dos por otro trastorno frente a paci-entes no deprimidos.\nHa resultado en un total de 21 \npublicaciones revisadas por exper-tos de AMOS. Este art\u00edculo propor-ciona una visi\u00f3n general de las prin-cipales cuestiones de investigaci\u00f3n, m\u00e9todos y los resultados de estas publicaciones: el tratamiento antro-pos\u00f3fico era seguro y se asociaba a mejoras cl\u00ednicamente relevantes en los s\u00edntomas y la calidad de vida sin aumento de los costes; se observa-ron mejoras en todos los grupos de edad, diagn\u00f3stico y modalidad de terapia y se mantuvieron en el seguimiento de 48 meses; el sesgo ajeno a los entrevistados, la recuper-aci\u00f3n natural, la regresi\u00f3n a la media y las terapias adyuvantes jun-tos pod\u00edan explicar un m\u00e1ximo del 37 % de la mejor\u00eda.\na All homeopathic products and many AMPs are \u201cpotentized,\u201d ie, successively \ndiluted, each dilution step involving a rhythmic succussion (repeated shaking of \nliquids) or trituration (grinding of solids into lactose monohydrate). A D30 potency (also called 30X) has been potentized in a 1:10 dilution for 30 times, resulting in a 1:10\n-30 dilution.56\nVolume 3, Number 1 \u2022 January 2014 \u2022 www.gahmj.comGLOBAL ADVANCES IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE Review \u2022the manufacturing of AMPs includes special phar -\nmaceutical processes that are rarely used for \nhomeopathic or other non-AM products: eg, pro-duction of metal mirrors by chemical vapor decom-position and processing of herbs by fermentation, toasting, carbonization, incineration, or digestion (heat treatment at 37\u00b0C)\n7; and\n \u2022potentized AMPs \nare rarely prepared in potencies \nhigher than D30.9\nIn AM art therapy, the patients engage in painting, \ndrawing, sculpture modeling, or music or speech exer-cises, whereby the specific qualities of each artistic medium are utilized to achieve specific effects.\n10-15\nEurythmy therapy is an artistic exercise therapy \ninvolving cognitive, emotional, and volitional elements. In eurythmy therapy sessions, patients exercise specific movements with the hands, the feet, or the whole body. Eurythmy movements are related to the sounds of vowels and consonants, to music intervals, or to soul gestures (eg, sympathy-antipathy). Between therapy sessions, the patients exercise eurythmy movements daily.\n16,17 \nRhythmical massage therapy was developed from \nSwedish massage. In rhythmical massage treatment, traditional massage techniques (effleurage, petrissage, friction, tapotement, vibration) are supplemented by special techniques such as gentle lifting movements, rhythmically undulating gliding movements, and complex movement patterns like lemniscates.\n18,19 \nAM training programs for physicians and thera-\npists are offered at university medical schools or high schools or as separate programs. The programs follow international, standardized curricula and lead to national or international certification as \u201cAM physi-cian,\u201d \u201cAM art therapist,\u201d etc.\n6 Therapy guidelines exist \nfor AM medical therapy,20 AM art therapy,21 and \neurythmy therapy.22\nBefore prescribing AMPs or referring patients for \nAM therapies, AM physicians have prolonged consul-tations with the patients and their caregivers. These consultations are used to take an extended history, to address constitutional and psychosocial aspect of the patients\u2019 illness, to explore the patients\u2019 and caregivers\u2019 preparedness to engage in treatment, and to select opti-mal, individualized therapy for each patient.\n1,19 In \naddition to individualized therapy, a number of stan-dardized AMP treatment regimens involving one or several pre-defined AMPs are available.\n23\nTo a certain extent, patients also can start AM \ntherapy independently of a physician, as some AMPs are available without prescription and as patients can go directly to AM therapists.\nCurrently, AM is practiced in 66 countries world-\nwide, with the majority of AM physicians working in Europe (Germany, Switzerland, France, Poland, Italy, Spain, The Netherlands) and the Americas (Argentina, United States, Brazil).\n6 AM is used for the whole spec-\ntrum of diseases and is integrated into the whole range of healthcare provision. Thus, in Europe, AM is prac-ticed in 24 inpatient hospitals, 14 of which are hospitals with trauma and emergency services, including two university teaching hospitals and one hospital provid-ing emergency services for a large German airport.\n6 In \nthe United Kingdom, the National Centre for Social Research has studied AM as a possible model of inte-grated primary care.\n19 In Germany, AM is recognized, \nalongside homeopathy and phytotherapy, as \u201cparticu-lar therapy system\u201d under the Medicines Act and is represented by its own committee at the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices.\n24 Reim -\nbursement of AM treatment costs by health insurance systems differs across countries and is, inverse to the\n \nhigher concentration of AM practitioners in Europe, more widespread outside Europe than in Europe.\n6 \nthe Anthroposophic Medicine Outcomes Study\nThe Anthroposophic Medicine Outcomes Study \n(AMOS) was occasioned by a health benefit program in Germany. The program included reimbursement of AM treatment costs in outpatients in those two areas:\n \u2022medical therapy: prolonged consultation with AM physicians; and\n \u2022nonmedical therapy on prescription from AM physicians: AM art therapy\n, eurythmy therapy, \nand rhythmical massage therapy.\nAMOS was a prospective 4-year observational \nstudy of patients starting AM outpatient treatment \nunder routine conditions. Eligibility criteria followed the criteria for inclusion in the health benefit program: adults and children with any chronic condition.\n25\nPatients were enrolled in AMOS between the years \n1998 and 2005. When 2-year findings in patients enrolled up to March 2001 were first published,\n25 there \nwas still a scarcity of published data on use, effective-ness, long-term outcomes, safety, and costs of AM treat-ment in outpatient care\u2014in general and in patient subgroups according to age, diagnosis, and AM therapy modalities. Much detailed information on these topics became available from AMOS, and the following study analyses were published separately: clinical outcomes in all patients after 4 years,\n26 in children,27 in the six \nlargest diagnosis groups,28-33 and in the four major \ntherapy modality groups34-37; a nested prospective com-\nparison to conventional treatment for low back pain38; \na health costs analysis39; and a safety analysis of AMPs.40 \nAll 16 of these analyses25-40 were pre-planned (eg, a \n4-year follow-up had been implemented on all patients enrolled from 1999 to 2005; specific documentation modules had been implemented for children and for 10 diagnoses, six of which had at least 40 patients each enrolled in AMOS and were published separately).

The study was initiated by a health insurance company in conjunc-tion with a health benefit program.\n46 The main objec-\ntives were to study clinical outcomes following AM treatment as well as safety and health costs. Further research questions concerned characteristics of AM users, AM therapy administration, use of non-AM adjunctive therapies, and patient satisfaction.\nSetting, Participants, and therapy\nAll physicians certified by the Physicians\u2019 Association for Anthroposophical Medicine in Germany and working in an office-based practice or outpatient clinic were invited to participate in the AMOS study. In the period from July 1, 1998, to December 31, 2005, a total of 151 participating physi-cians recruited 1631 consecutive patients starting AM therapy under routine clinical conditions. Inclusion criteria for all analyses were the following:\n1.\n Outpatients aged 1 to 75 years and living in Germany; and \n2\n. startin\ng AM therapy for a chronic indication \n(main disorder)2a)\n AM-related consultation of at least 30  \n minutes followed by new prescription of at  \n least one AMP or\n2b\n)  referral to AM therapy by nonmedical  \n therapist: art, eurythmy\n, or rhythmical massage. \nPatients were excluded if they had previously \nreceived the AM therapy in question (see inclusion cri-teria no. 2) for their main diagnosis. Further eligibility criteria applied to individual analyses, eg, a minimum disease duration of 30 days,\n26-28,41,42 6 weeks,32,38 or 6 \nmonths30,31,43 or further age restrictions (Table 2). \nInclusion criteria for the  analysis of major diagnosis groups were the following:\n \u2022anxiety disorder28: physician\u2019s diagnosis \n(International Classification of Diseases, 10th edi-tion [ICD-10] F40-F42 or F43.1), \n \u2022asthma29: physician\u2019s diagnosis (ICD-10 J45); \n \u2022attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms\n30: physician\u2019s diagnosis (ICD-10 F90);\n \u2022depression31: adapted criteria for dysthymic disor-\nder from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV)\n47;\n \u2022low back pain32,38: physician\u2019s diagnosis (ICD-10 \nM40-54); and\n \u2022migraine33: criteria of the International Headache \nSociety.48\nFor the diagnosis group low back pain, additional \nexclusion criteria were previous back surgery and 11 specific diagnoses.\n32,38 Other inclusion criteria were \nfor a safety analysis of AMPs, the use of at least one AMP,\n40 and for three analyses, the availability of fol-\nlow-up data.38,39,42\nAM therapy was administrated at the discretion of \nthe physicians and therapists and evaluated as a whole system\n49 with subgroup analyses of age, diagnosis, and \ntherapy modality groups.

Pre-post assessments of clini-\ncal outcomes were subject to bivariate analysis using standard parametric and nonparametric methods: For paired continuous data, the t -test or the Wilcoxon \nSigned-Rank test was used; median differences with 95% confidence intervals were estimated according to Hodges and Lehmann. For bivariate binominal data, the McNemar test was used. All tests were two-tailed. For the diagnosis groups ADHD and asthma,\n29,30 \nrepeated measures analysis of variance also was per-formed. Pre-post effect sizes were calculated as stan-dardized response mean and classified as minimal (<0.20), small (0.20-0.49), medium (0.50-0.79), and large (\u2265\n 0.80).64,65 \nIn most cases,25,27-29,31,34-37,41 the main analysis of \nclinical outcomes was performed on patients with evaluable data for each follow-up without replacement of missing values. Replacement of missing values with the last value carried forward was used in a number of sensitivity analyses\n27-29,31,34-37,41,45 and as the main \nanalysis in three cases.26,30,33\nNested Prospective Comparative Non-\nrandomized Study.  For the diagnosis group low back \npain, a prospective nonrandomized comparative study was nested within the AMOS study.\n38 In this study, \nAMOS patients with low back pain were compared to low back pain patients receiving conventional care. The patients in the two groups fulfilled identical eligi-bility criteria (see \u201cSetting, participants, and therapy\u201d above); AMOS patients were treated by AM physicians, while the patients in the control group were treated by physicians not using AM or other complementary therapies. Clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction were compared after 6 and 12 months. Clinical out-comes were compared using repeated measures analy-sis of variance, unadjusted and after adjustment for baseline score of the outcome, for gender, age, low back pain duration, and educational level (university entrance qualification).\n38 Patient satisfaction was com-\npared using Mann-Whitney U-test.38Systematic Outcome Comparison With \nCorresponding Cohorts in Other Studies.  For several \nother frequent diagnoses in AMOS, this study was the first outpatient study of AM therapy. It was therefore desirable to compare outcomes in AMOS to outcomes of other treatments for these diagnoses. Since only pre-post data were available in AMOS (apart from low back pain, see above), these comparisons would have to be of pre-post changes in patient cohorts derived from differ-ent studies. Although such comparisons cannot assess comparative effectiveness, they nevertheless yield information about the relative order of magnitude of treatment outcomes. Such comparisons are often pre-sented in discussion sections as rudimentary narrative reviews; they are often limited to selected studies and often mix different outcomes and follow-up periods.\nWe devised a systematic extension and upgrading \nof this type of narrative review, combining the strengths of systematic, criteria-based literature selection and analysis with the descriptive assessment of treatment outcomes. A systematic review was conducted,\n44 com-\nprising the five largest AMOS diagnosis groups in adult patients: asthma, depression, low back pain, migraine, and neck pain. The five AMOS diagnosis groups were compared to all retrievable patient cohorts with corre-sponding diagnoses, outcome measures (SF-36 Health Survey\n66), and follow-up periods (3, 6, or 12 months) \nreceiving other treatment.\nEligibility criteria for the comparison cohorts were \n \u2022pr\nospective cohort of at least 20 evaluable adult \npatients (as in the AMOS diagnostic groups);\n \u2022at least 80% of the patients of the study or a defined subgroup thereof having one of the fiv\ne diagnoses \nlisted above (the AMOS diagnosis group anxiety dis-orders was not included in this review because of diagnostic heterogeneity with low sample sizes in relevant diagnostic subgroups: ICD-10 F41.1 general-ized anxiety disorder [n\n = 28], F41.0 panic disorder\n \n[n = 25], F40 phobic anxiety disorder [n  = 15])28;\n \u2022patients starting any therapeutic intervention\n \nincluding treatment-as-usual; and  \n \u2022results published in English or one of eight other listed languages.\nIn addition, for low back pain cohorts, the same\n table 4 Documentation of Quality of Life\nRecruitment period\nAge, y Outcome measure Scores and scales Reference no.\nJul 1998-Dec 2005 17-75 SF-36 Health Survey Physical and Mental Component Summary scores,  \neight scales, Health Change item 57\nJul 1998-Mar 2001 8-16 KINDL 40-Item version Total score; Psychic, Somatic, Social, and Function  \nsubscales58\nApr 2001-Dec 2005 4-16 KINDL 24-item version Total score; Physical Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, \nSelf-Esteem, Family, Friends, Everyday Functioning59\nJul 1998-Mar 2001 1-7 KITA Quality of Life Questionnaire Psychosoma, Daily Life 60\nAbbreviations: KINDL, KINDL Questionnaire for Measuring Health-Related Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents; KITA, [German] Kindertagesst\u00e4tte, \ndaycare facility for children; SF-36, Short Form (36).62\nVolume 3, Number 1 \u2022 January 2014 \u2022 www.gahmj.comGLOBAL ADVANCES IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE Reviewexclusion criteria as in the low back pain diagnosis \ngroup in AMOS applied (see above). Eligible publica-tions were identified by systematic searches in 10 litera-ture databases.\n44\nFor these comparisons, between-group effect sizes \nwere calculated64 and classified as for pre-post analyses. \nPre-post changes in an AMOS diagnosis group and in a corresponding cohort were defined to have the same order of magnitude if the between-group effect size was minimal to small (range \u20130.49 to 0.49 standard devia-tions). The analyses of this review were descriptive without statistical hypothesis testing.\n44\nPredictors of Clinical Outcome.  Multiple linear \nregression analyses were performed to identify predic-tors of symptom score change from baseline after 6 and 12 months in adults\n42 and in children.27\nSafety Analyses . All suspected adverse reactions \nwere classified as reported adverse reactions and sub-jected to descriptive analysis.\n25,26,28-33,35-37 Suspected \nadverse reactions to AMPs as well as serious adverse events were also analyzed individually\n26,40; the causal \nrelationship of these events medications and nonmedi-cation therapies was classified according to predefined criteria \n as probable, possible, improbable, no relation-\nship, or unable to evaluate. Events with a possible or probable causal relationship to AMPs were classified as confirmed adverse drug reactions.\nHealth Costs.  Health costs were calculated by mul-\ntiplying resource use with unit costs for the respective item. Resource use was documented by the patients, unit costs were calculated from average costs per item in Germany or from reimbursement fees regulated in healthcare benefit catalogues. For health costs, bootstrap means with bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) boot-strap 95% confidence intervals were calculated, using 2000 replications per analysis.\n67 All cost analyses25,39,43 \ncompared health costs in the pre-study year to costs in the first and (except in\n25) second study years. In one \nanalysis, health costs were compared in adult AMOS patients treated for depression and patients treated for another disorder, with or without depressive symptoms, respectively, using generalized linear models.\n43\nBias and Sensitivity Analyses.  Selection bias.  \nSince AMOS had a long recruitment period, the study physicians were not able to screen and enroll all eligi-ble patients. A patient selection on part of the physi-cians could bias results if physicians were able to pre-dict therapy response and if they preferentially screened and enrolled such patients for whom they expected a particularly favorable outcome. It was hypothesized that if such selection bias occurred, the degree of patient selection (equal to\n the proportion of eligible vs\n \nenrolled patients) for each physician would be posi-tively correlated with a favorable clinical outcome in his or her patients. The degree of patient selection was calculated from a survey of AMOS physicians of the number of eligible patients seen in the past 12 months. Correlations between the degree of patient selection and symptom score after 6 months\n42 and 12 months31 were calculated using Spearman-Rho.\nCombined bias suppression.  Since AMOS was a \nsingle-arm cohort study (apart from the diagnosis of low back pain), the effect of the therapeutic interven-tions could not be separated from effects of other fac-tors by comparison to a control group. For this reason a procedure for combined suppression of four relevant bias factors (nonrespondent bias, natural recovery, regression to the mean, and adjunctive therapies) was developed and used for a series of sensitivity analyses of clinical outcomes after 6 or 12 months. Nonrespondent bias was suppressed by replacing missing values with the baseline value carried forward. Regression to the mean was suppressed by replacing disease score at study enrolment with disease score 3 months before study enrolment. Bias from natural recovery was sup-pressed by restricting the analysis to patients with dis-ease duration of at least 12 months. Bias from adjunc-tive therapies was suppressed by restricting the sample to patients not using diagnosis-related adjunctive ther-apies during the first 6 months after study enrolment. The four sensitivity analyses were then combined in an extreme scenario sensitivity analysis that was per-formed on all patients enrolled up to March 2001\n45 and, \nwith some modifications, in various subgroups.27-37,41\nOther sensitivity analyses.  The comparison of \nSF-36 outcomes in AMOS diagnosis groups and corre-sponding cohorts was reanalyzed, restricting the num-ber of comparisons to increase comparability of study design, setting, therapy, and baseline score.\n44 Predictors \nof clinical outcome were re-analyzed under altered con-ditions regarding the handling of missing values, the dependent variable, or the follow-up period, and were also re-analyzed in random subsamples.\n42 Health costs \nwere re-analyzed varying the assumptions about diag-nostic criteria,\n39,43 health resource use,25,43 and costs \nper resource unit.25,43\nRESUL tS\nAn overview of the 21 publications is given in \nTable 1. The publications can be accessed at http://ifaemm.de/G10_AMOS.htm. Main results are summa-rized in Table 2. \nPatient Recruitment and Follow-up\nFrom July 1, 1998, to December 31, 2005, a total of \n1631 patients aged 1 to 75 years were enrolled. Patients enrolled after December 31, 1998 (n\n = 1544) \nhad follow-\nup assessments beyond 12 months; this group includes 1510 patients with a disease duration of at least 30 days. The participating physicians (n\n = 151) and therapists\n \n(n = 275) resembled eligible but not participating AM\n \nphysicians (n  = 167) and AM therapists (n  = 911) with\n \nrespect to demographic characteristics, and the includ-ed patients resembled screened but not included patients regarding baseline characteristics.\n26\nAt the primary follow-up assessments of clinical out-\ncomes after 6 or 12 months, the follow-up rate was 91% and 87%, respectively, in all patients\n26 (range 77%-92% in www.gahmj.com \u2022 January 2014 \u2022 Volume 3, Number 163\n ReviewOVERVIEW  OF THE PUBLICATIONS  FROM  THE ANTHROPOSOPHIC  MEDICINE  OUTCOMES  STUDY\nsubgroups, Table 2).

Corresponding nonre-\nspondent analyses at the last follow-up after 24 months\n27,28,31,32,38 or 48 months26,31,34,36 were also mostly \nnegative (five significant differences in 59 analyses). A telephone survey was performed on patients enrolled in the year 2005: the proportion of patients with clinical deterioration at 24-month follow-up was comparable in nonrespondents and respondents.\n32\nBaseline Characteristics\nThe patients were recruited from 15 of 16 German \nFederal states.26 Age groups were 1 to 19 years: 29.8% \n(n = 450/1510); 20 to 39 years: 25.4%; 40 to 59 years:\n \n35.2%; and 60 to 75 years: 9.6%, with a median age of 37.0 years (interquartile range [IQR] 12.3-47.1 y, mean 33.8 \u00b1\n 19.4 y). A total of 81.5% (n  = 975/1074) of adults\n \naged 17 to 75 years were women.26\nCompared to the German population, adult \npatients had higher educational and occupational lev-els and had a healthier lifestyle with regard to smoking, alcohol, and sports activities and were less overweight. The sociodemographic status of adults was similar to the population with regard to income and the propor-tion of adults living alone and less favorable for work disability pension and sick-leave (Table 5).\n26 \nIn children,27 the proportion of privately insured \npatients was comparable to that of the German population.76\nMost frequent indications were mental disorders \n(ICD-10 F00-F99, 35.2%, n  = 532/1510); musculoskeletal\n \ndisorders (M00-M99, 15.4%); respiratory disorders (J00-J99, 9.9%); and neurological disorders (G00-G99, 7.2%).\n26 The most frequent diagnosis groups are listed \nin Table 2. Disease duration at baseline was 1 month to 2 months in 4.4% (n\n = 67/1510) of patients; 3 to 5\n \nmonths in 5.0%; 6 to 11 months in 8.5%; 1 to 4 years in 38.3%, and \u22655 years in 43.7%, with a median disease \nduration of 3.5 years (IQR 1.0-8.5 y, mean 6.6 \u00b1\n 8.2 y).26\ntherapy\nAt enrolment, 19.4% (n  = 293/1510) of patients \nstarted AM therapy provided by the physician, while \nthe \nremaining patients were referred to AM art therapy \n(18.2%), eurythmy therapy (52.6%), or rhythmical mas-sage therapy (9.8%). Of the patients referred to art, eurythmy, or rhythmical massage therapy, 86.8% had the respective therapy, 0.5% did not have the therapy, \ntable 5 Sociodemographic Characteristics of Adult Patients (aged 17-75 y, n  = 1074)\nItem Subgroup Patients german \nPopulation\nN % % Reference no.\nEducation63Low (Grade 1) 184 17.1 43 68, 69\nIntermediate (Grade 2) 530 49.3 43\nHigh (Grade 3) 360 33.5 14\nWage earners 39/1074 3.6 18 68\nUnemployed during the past 12 mo Economically active patients 37/618 6.0 10 68\nLiving alone 208/1069 19.5 21 68\nNet family income <\u20ac 900 per mo 160/871 18.4 16 68\nAlcohol use daily (patients) vs almost  \ndaily (German population)Male 12/198 6.1 28 70\nFemale 19/875 2.2 11\nRegular smoking Male 26/199 13.1 37 71\nFemale 92/873 10.5 28\nSports activity \u22651 hour weekly Age 25-69 y 484/887 54.6 39 72\nBody mass index <18.5 (low weight) Male 7/196 3.6 1 68\nFemale 61/863 7.1 4\nBody mass index \u226525 (overweight) Male 64/196 32.7 56 68\nFemale 219/863 25.4 39\nPermanent work disability pension 204/1072 19.0 3 73\nSevere disability status 116/1072 10.8 12 74\nSick leave days in the last 12 months:  \nmean \u00b1 standard deviationEconomically active patients 32.6 \u00b1 67.3 17.0 75\nTable reproduced from Hamre et al.2664 Volume 3, Number 1 \u2022 January 2014 \u2022 www.gahmj.comGLOBAL ADVANCES IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE\nReviewand for 12.6%, the therapy documentation is incom-\nplete.

All primary outcome mea-\nsures improved significantly from baseline to the pri-mary follow-up assessment after 6 months,\n25-28,30,41 12 \nmonths,29,31,34-38 or 48 months;26 in the whole sam-\nple,25 in adults and children, in all analyzed diagnosis \ngroups,28-33 and in all therapy modality groups34-37,41 \n(Figure 1) (P <.001 for all 24 pre-post comparisons). \nStandardized response mean effect sizes were large for 21 comparisons and medium for three comparisons (Table 6). Improvements were similar in patients not using conventional therapy for their main disorder.\n41\nQuality-of-life scores (SF-36, KINDL, KITA, see Table \n4) improved significantly from baseline to the primary follow-up assessments in the whole sample\n25 and in most \ndiagnosis28,31,32,38 and therapy modality34-37,41 groups \n(122 significant improvements in 138 pre-post analyses). Of the 16 pre-post analyses not showing significant improvements, five analyses had a sample size of <17 patients. All significant symptom and quality of life improvements were maintained at the last follow-up assessment after 12 months,\n41 24 months,27-30,32,33 and 48 \nmonths,26,34-37 respectively (one exception: KINDL total \nscore in the asthma group, n = 1229).\nAt 6-month follow-up, the patients\u2019 mean rating of \ntherapy outcome (0 = no help at all, 10 = helped very well) was 7.23 \u00b1 2.39 points; patient satisfaction with \ntherapy (0 = very dissatisfied, 10 = very satisfied) was 7.94 \u00b1 2.20 points.\n26 In age, diagnosis, and therapy modality \nsubgroups, the mean therapy outcome ratings ranged from 6.29 (ADHD symptoms\n30) to 7.54 (depression31) \nand therapy satisfaction ranged from 7.45 (ADHD symp-toms\n30) to 8.23 (AM art therapy)35 (Table 7).\nNested Prospective Comparative Nonrandom-\nized Study.  In a nested prospective nonrandomized \ncomparative study, the AMOS diagnosis group low back pain was compared to patients starting conven-tional treatment for low back pain after 6 and 12 months:\n38 In both groups analyzed together, back pain \n(Low Back Pain Rating Scale Pain Score56), back func-\ntion (Hanover Functional Ability Questionnaire54), \nsymptom score, and some SF-36 scales improved. Three SF-36 scales were significantly more improved in AMOS patients (Mental Health, General Health, and Vitality); other improvements did not differ signifi-cantly between the two groups. At 6-month follow-up, AMOS patients had significantly higher therapy out-come ratings (P  = .009) and showed a trend for higher \npatient satisfaction (P  = .051) than patients receiving \nconventional care (Table 7).\n38\nSystematic Outcome Comparison With \nCorresponding Cohorts in Other Studies.  In a system-\natic review, adult AMOS patients with asthma, depres-sion, low back pain, migraine, and neck pain (n = 392 \npatients) were compared to other patient cohorts with corresponding diagnoses receiving other treatment.\n44 A \ntotal of 63 publications fulfilled all eligibility criteria for the review (see Methods section). These publications reported one or more comparison cohorts with low back pain (n = 24 publications), depression (n = 13), migraine (n = 13), asthma (n = 11), and neck pain (n = 2), comprising 84 comparison cohorts with 16 167 patients. \nA total of 517 comparisons of 10 different SF-36 scales showed improvements largely of the same order of mag-nitude in AMOS subgroups and corresponding cohorts (minimal-to-small differences in 80% of the compari-sons), with medium-to-large differences favoring AMOS and the corresponding cohorts in 14% and 7% of the comparisons, respectively (Figure 2). Sensitivity analy-ses had only small effects on the results.\n44\nPredictors of Clinical Outcomes. In adults42 and \nchildren,27 improvements of symptom scores after 6 \nand 12 months were positively predicted by higher baseline symptom intensity and negatively predicted by longer disease duration. Baseline symptom severity was the strongest predictor, accounting for 25% and 17% of the variance after 6 months in adults and chil-dren, respectively (total models 32% and 23%, respec-tively). In adults, improvements were also positively predicted by better physical function, better general health, and (in most sensitivity analyses) higher educa-tion level and higher therapy goal at baseline.\n42 The \nlatter variable was not analyzed in children. In chil-dren, improvements were also negatively predicted by baseline disease score.\n27\nBias Analyses.  Patient selection.

In an analysis of all \npatients enrolled up to March 2001, four bias factors (nonrespondent bias, natural recovery, regression to the mean, and adjunctive therapies) could together explain a maximum of 37% of the 0- to 6-month improvement of disease score, with a residual improve-ment of 1.87 points (95% CI 1.69-2.06 points) (Figure 3).\n45 Corresponding analyses of primary outcome mea-\nsures were performed in children27 and in the different \ndiagnosis25,27-33 and therapy modality groups;34-37,41 \nsuppressing one,32 two,29,30,36 three,27,28,34,35 or \nfour31,37,41 bias factors. These analyses yielded similar \nresults to the main bias analysis45 (a maximum of 35% \nof the improvement explained in depression group31) \nor a lower percentage explained (range 0%-19% in other analyses).\nSafety\nThe incidence of confirmed adverse reactions to \nAMPs was 3.0% (n  = 20/662) of \nusers; 2.2% (n  = 21/949) of\n the AMPs used; and 0.3% (n  = 30/11 \n487) of patient-months \nof AMP use. Confirmed adverse reactions of severe inten-sity occurred in 0.3% of AMP users while 1.5% had a con-firmed reaction leading them to stop their AMP use.\n40\nThe incidence of reported adverse reactions to art, \neurythmy, or rhythmical massage therapy was 2.0% (n\n = 21/1065) of therapy users for any reaction; 0.4%\n \n(n = 4) for reactions of severe intensity; and 0.3% (n  = 3)\n \nfor reactions leading patients to stop their therapy.26\nNo serious adverse reactions to any AMPs or AM \ntherapies occurred.26\nHealth Costs\nIn a preliminary analysis without statistical \nhypothesis testing, total health costs were reduced by 4% from the pre-study year to the first study year.\n25\nIn a subsequent analysis of a larger sample size \n(Figure 4), costs in the first study year did not differ significantly from costs in the pre-study year, where-as in the second year, costs were significantly reduced by 13%.\n39 Both these analyses25,39 consisted of adults \nand children. \nIn an analysis of adult patients treated for depres-table 6 Standardized Response Mean Effect Sizes of Primary Outcome Measures\ngroups Patient-reported \nOutcome MeasuresaMonth SRM N Reference no.\nAll patients Primary analysis Symptom score 6 1.09 736 25\nFollow-up analysis Symptom score 48 1.13 1510 26\nChildren Symptom score 6 0.97 381 27\nDiagnosis groups Anxiety disorders Anxiety severity 6 1.71 44 28\nAsthma Average asthma severity 12 0.90 66 29\nADHD symptoms FBB-HKS total score [parent rating] 6 0.68 60 30\nDepression CES-D 12 1.20 75 31\nMigraine Average migraine severity 6 1.09 44 33\nLow back pain HFAQ 24 0.59 46 32\nLow back pain LBPRS 24 0.59 47 32\nTherapy groups Medical treatment\n-Prolonged consultation with  \nAM physicianSymptom score 12 1.05 184 34\n-AM products Symptom score 6 1.01 559 41\nArt therapy Symptom score 12 1.03 135 35\nEurythmy therapy Symptom score 12 1.04 336 36\nRhythmical massage therapy Symptom score 12 1.14 59 37\nPhysician-reported outcome measuresa\nAll patients Disease score 6 1.23 738 25\nChildren Disease score 6 1.30 362 27\nDiagnosis groups Anxiety disorders Anxiety severity 6 1.52 57 28\nMigraine Average migraine severity 6 1.30 44 33\nTherapy groups Medical treatment\n-Prolonged consultation with  \nAM physicianDisease score 12 1.52 155 34\n-AM products Disease score 6 1.35 583 41\nArt therapy Disease score 12 1.76 97 35\nEurythmy therapy Disease score 12 1.34 237 36\nRhythmical massage therapy Disease score 12 1.45 56 37\na Outcome measures are described in Table 3.\nAbbreviations: ADHD, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder; AM, anthroposophic medicine; CES-D, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; FBB-HKS: \n[German] Fremdbeurteilungsbogen f\u00fcr Hyperkinetische St\u00f6rungen, a questionnaire of core ADHD symptoms; HFAQ, Hanover Functional Ability Questionnaire; LBPRS, Low Back Pain Rating Scale Pain score; SRM, standardized response mean effect size (minimal: <0.20, small: 0.20-0.49, medium: 0.50-0.79, large: \u22650.80).66\nVolume 3, Number 1 \u2022 January 2014 \u2022 www.gahmj.comGLOBAL ADVANCES IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE Reviewsion, costs in the pre-study year were 102% and 63% \nhigher than costs for patients treated for another disor-der with and without depressive symptoms, respec-tively. Among the patients with depression, compared to the pre-study year, costs in the second study year were significantly decreased by 27%, while costs in the other two groups (patients with other disorders with or without depressive symptoms) showed little change.\n43\nThe cost reduction observed in these analyses was \nlargely due to a reduction of inpatient hospitalization that could not be explained by secular trends during the study period.\n39 Another possible explanation is fre-\nquent or long hospitalization early in the course of dis-ease (diagnostic assessment, therapy initiation) fol-lowed by a normalization of hospitalization rates. A sensitivity analysis suggested that this factor could at maximum explain 37% of the hospitalization reduc-tion.\n39 Other sensitivity analyses25,39,43 had only small \neffects on the results.\ndISCUSSION\nMain Findings\nWe have summarized methods and findings in all 21 \npeer-review publications from the AMOS study,25-45 a \n4-year prospective observational study of multimodal AM therapy for chronic disease in routine outpatient care. AMOS involved more than 400 therapy providers and more than 1600 patients with mental, musculoskeletal, respiratory, or neurological disorders or other chronic conditions. Following AM therapy (physician counseling, AMPs, art therapy, eurythmy therapy, rhythmical mas-sage therapy), substantial and sustained improvements of disease symptoms and quality of life were observed.\n26 These improvements were found in adults25,42 and chil-\ndren27 and in all analyzed diagnosis25,27-33 and therapy \nmodality groups.34-37,41 Quality of life improvements in \nadults were at least similar to improvements in patients receiving conventional care.\n38,44 Health costs were not \nincreased, although the patients were starting new AM therapy; in the second year, the costs were significantly decreased.\n39 Adverse reactions to AM treatment were \ninfrequent and mostly of mild-to-moderate intensi -\nty.34-37,40 Patient satisfaction was high.26\nSignificance of the Anthroposophic Medicine \nOutcomes Study\nIn terms of the numbers of participating therapy \nproviders and patients, the scope of documentation, \nand the length of follow-up, AMOS is by far the larg-est clinical outcome study of AM to date. Nonetheless, one might ask why such a large number of publica-tions has been forthcoming from this project. The main reason is the scarcity of data on clinical out-comes, costs, and safety of AM treatment for chronic noncancer conditions. AMOS includes the first clini-cal studies of anxiety disorders,\n28 nonmedication AM \ntherapy for migraine,33 and rhythmical massage ther-\napy for any indication,37 as well as the first large stud-\nies of ADHD30 and of eurythmy therapy.36 In the field \nof primary care research, AMOS includes the first studies of depression,\n31 low back pain,32,38 AM medi-\ncal treatment for chronic disease,34 and AM art thera-\npy for any indication,35 as well as the first large study \nof AM treatment for children with chronic disease.27 \nAMOS has yielded the first multivariate predictor analyses of long-term outcome following AM treat-Table 7 Patients\u2019 Rating of Therapy Outcome, Patient Satisfaction With Therapy\ngroups therapy \nOutcome Rating Satisfaction With therapy\nReference no.\nMean S d NaMean S d Na\nAll patients 7.23 2.39 1275 7.94 2.20 1273 26\nAge groups Adults 7.33 2.33 556 8.01 2.16 558 77\nChildren 7.12 2.56 370 7.87 2.27 371 27\nIndications Anxiety disorders 6.82 2.74 50 7.61 2.65 49 29\nAsthma 7.54 2.44 65 8.19 2.12 64 30\nAttention deficit/hyperactivity symptoms 6.29 2.70 52 7.45 2.12 51 31\nDepression 7.54 1.76 74 7.92 1.86 74 31\nLow back painb\n-Anthroposophic therapy (AMOS) 7.28 2.31 29 7.62 2.30 29 38\n-Conventional therapy (control group) 5.58 2.55 26 6.50 2.39 26 38\nMigraine 7.33 2.42 33 7.72 2.05 32 33\nTherapy modalities Medical treatment\n-Prolonged consultations with  \nanthroposophic physicians7.21 2.64 182 7.81 2.45 182 34\n-Anthroposophic medicinal products 7.12 2.46 550 7.80 2.26 546 41\nArt therapy 7.52 1.95 132 8.23 1.79 133 35\nEurythmy therapy 7.42 2.29 349 8.08 2.19 352 36\nRhythmical massage therapy 7.50 2.34 62 8.18 2.08 62 37\nPatients\u2019 ratings of therapy outcome (0 = no help at all, 10 = helped very much) and patient satisfaction with therapy (0 = very dissatisfied, 10 = very satisfied) at \n6-month follow-up, analyzed in all patients and in different age, diagnosis, and therapy modality groups.\na Patients who returned the 6-month follow-up questionnaire with evaluable responses to the respective item.\nb A nested prospective comparative nonrandomized study of patients with low back pain.38www.gahmj.com \u2022 January 2014 \u2022 Volume 3, Number 167\n ReviewOVERVIEW  OF THE PUBLICATIONS  FROM  THE ANTHROPOSOPHIC  MEDICINE  OUTCOMES  STUDY\nment for chronic noncancer indications in adults27 \nand children,27 the first detailed safety analysis of \nAMPs within a large prospective cohort study,40 and \nthe first detailed economic analysis of AM treat-\nment.39 These comparisons refer to published and \nunpublished studies on AM.78 A comparison restrict-\ned to peer-review publications would underline the pioneer position of AMOS even more.\nApart from its significance for the evaluation of \nAM treatment, AMOS has also fostered two method-ological innovations for the analysis of single-arm ther-apy studies (combined bias suppression\n45 and system-\natic outcome comparison with corresponding cohorts in other studies\n44) and the first depression cost analysis \nworldwide comparing primary care patients treated for depression vs depressed patients treated for another disorder vs non-depressed patients.\n43Strengths and Limitations\nStrengths of AMOS and the body of AMOS publica-\ntions include a naturalistic real-world therapy setting; a large sample size; a long follow-up period; the combina-tion of generic and disease-specific outcome measures; a high representativeness of the participating physicians, therapists, and patients; detailed cost and safety analy-ses; and the widespread use of sensitivity analyses.\nThe AMOS study had an observational single-arm \ndesign. In addition, a concurrent nonrandomized con-trol group was available for the diagnosis group low back pain,\n38 but the validity of this comparison is lim-\nited by a high nonrespondent rate of 42% in the con-trol group. Furthermore, a systematic comparative review was conducted in order to assess the order magnitude of the improvements in AMOS relative to improvements in other therapy studies.

Positive effect sizes indicate larger pre-post improvement in AMOS cohort than in corresponding cohort. Figure reproduced from Hamre et al.\n44 68\nVolume 3, Number 1 \u2022 January 2014 \u2022 www.gahmj.comGLOBAL ADVANCES IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE Reviewsamples were identified through systematic reviews \nfor five common AMOS diagnoses. Outcomes were then evaluated to assess similarities and differences between AM treatment outcomes and those for a vari-ety of other treatment strategies. These nonconcurrent comparisons were descriptive and limited to compara-tive order of magnitude.\n44 \nTo further compensate for the limitations of the \npre-post design, a systematic procedure to assess the potential impact of four possible causes of pre-post improvements, apart from AM therapy (nonrespon-dent bias, natural recovery, regression to the mean, adjunctive therapies) on clinical outcomes was devel-oped and used in AMOS. This combined bias suppres-sion procedure is novel and needs to be further evalu-ated in future studies.\n45\nAnother issue is the possibility of selection bias \nfrom physicians\u2019 expectations of the patients\u2019 future therapy response (see Methods for details). Extensive analyses suggest that if such a patient selection did occur, this selection did not affect clinical outcomes.\n31,42\nThe integration of different diagnosis-specific docu-\nmentation modules into one research project in routine outpatient care necessitated some compromises: eg, there were no data on airway caliber in asthma patients\n29 and \nno structured psychiatric interviews for diagnostic assess-ment of patients with mental disorders.\n28,30,31\nComparison to Other Studies of Multimodal \nAnthroposophic treatment\nMultimodal AM treatment (including AMPs and \nnonmedication AM therapies) for chronic noncancer \nindications has been investigated in other studies with various indications: anorexia nervosa,\n79-81 asthma,82 \nepilepsy,83 hepatitis C,84,85 inflammatory rheumatic \ndisorders,85 intervertebral disc disease,86 and rehabilita-\ntion after stroke.87 These studies were performed in \ninpatient hospitals79-81,84,87,88 or specialized outpatient \nclinics82,83,85,86 and had, like AMOS, an observational design. All studies showed benefit from AM treatment.78 \nThe AMOS study, in predominantly primary care set-tings, showed substantial and sustained improvements in symptoms and quality of life\n25 in accordance with \nthese studies from specialized settings.\nImplications for Practice\nWithin the limits of an observational, largely pre-\npost design, the AMOS study suggests that AM thera-pies can be useful in the long-term care of patients with chronic noncancer disease.\nImplications for Research\nThe analysis and publication strategy for AMOS \nincorporates two features proposed for the evaluation of complementary or integrative therapy systems. The first feature is a sequential approach,\n 89,90 starting with \nthe whole therapy system (use, safety, outcomes, per-ceived benefit),\n25-27,42,45 addressing comparative effec-\ntiveness,38,44 and then proceeding to an evaluation of \nthe major system components.34-37,41 The second fea-\nture is using a mix of different research methods to build an information synthesis,\n90 including pre-post \nobservational studies,25-37,41,45 comparative observa -\ntional studies,38,43 systematic reviews,44 economic anal-\nyses,39,43 and safety analyses of individual patient \ndata.40 Notably, an evaluation strategy incorporating \nsuch features89,90 will usually comprise a series of \nresearch projects, while AMOS was one single project.\nFuture studies on AM treatment for chronic dis-\nease will probably not attempt to replicate AMOS by including all age groups and all chronic indications but 0246810\n0 6 12Score (M ean + SD)\nMonthsWithout bias suppression \nCombined bias suppression \nFigure 3 Disease score without and with combined bias suppression.\nPatients aged 1-75 years, enrolled 1999-2001 with disease score available at \nbaseline, n = 887.
