Filled with research, personal stories, anecdotes, gentle reminders, and practical ideas from her years of experience as a school leader, she provides you with a pathway back to living the work-home life you want to lead.\"\n--Jimmy Casas, Leadership Coach, Educator, Author, and Speaker\n\"Jessica provokes you to self-reflect on leading without margin, while she graciously gifts you with her own transparency of her glows and grows of self-caring while in leadership. Her chapters embark you on a journey that has allowed us to revisit our own priorities as individuals, parents, and most importantly, as life partners.\"\n--Dr. Kevin and Mrs. Crystal Armstrong\n\"In Principal in Balance, Jessica Cabeen was able to put into words the honest journey of these past few years of the principalship. Jessica's vulnerable accounts of leadership, both at school and at home, helped me to name some of the same emotions that I have experienced. Her actionable, solution-driven strategies provide the next steps to sustainability. This will be a book that I will always keep close to reference and share readily with other leaders.\"\n--Beth Houf, Proud Principal, Fulton Middle School, NASSP 2022 National Principal of the Year\n\"Principal in Balance is an urgent call to action for all preK-12 educators and professionals to disrupt the chaos of 'busyness' in leadership to reconnect, recenter, rekindle, and rejuvenate our souls and humanity. Principal Cabeen provides practical wisdom essential to reclaim our dignity, exhausting opportunities without losing ourselves, and model self-love, self-knowledge, and self-actualization.\"\n--Dau Jok, Ph.D., Executive Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, West Des Moines Community Schools, West Des Moines, IA | CPT in the United States Army Reserve\n\"Jessica Cabeen not only brings solid research-based counsel, but speaks out of a transparent, authentic heart formed through significant hardship. I so appreciated her honesty and grace.\"\n--David Schmus, Executive Director, Christian Educators\n\"Jessica Cabeen is an authentic leader who uses her personal story of triumph, success, failures, and setbacks to help other leaders reflect and redefine their purpose. Principal in Balance is full of leadership strategies that are focused on helping leaders become better versions of themselves.\"\n--San\u00e9e Bell, Ed.D., District Leader, Author, and Speaker\n\"Principal in Balance is the book I wish I had 5-10 years ago in my life and career. Jessica's book is full of resources and brilliant ideas that can benefit anyone looking to live a life more balanced. This book will continue to be one that I buy extra copies of to give to everyone I know.\"\n--Todd Nesloney, Director of Culture and Strategic Leadership at the Texas Elementary Principals and Supervisors Association (TEPSA), Author, Speaker\n\"I couldn't put it down. Principal in Balance should be sitting on every educational leader's desk to remind us of the little things and BIG things that we can do each day to support us in the journey. When we live well, you lead well!\"\n--Curtis Slater, National Distinguished Principal 2018, TILL360 Cofounder, Speaker, Trainer, and Consultant\n\"My 35-year journey as a K-8 teacher and principal has been an amazing experience, but also a very challenging one. I prayed one day I would find the handbook to help me thrive and survive as a leader and a father, and I found it in Principal in Balance. Jessica Cabeen had me thinking so much throughout the book about finding a much needed balance, but also being more forgiving and kind to myself. If you read this book and don't feel like you can live a life worth leading and living, then you need to read it again. I am ready to lead and change education for another 10 years. Thanks, Jess!\"\n--Salome Thomas-EL, Ed.D., (aka Principal EL), Awardwinning Teacher, Principal, and Author\n\"While each of us is a work in progress, it's rare to come across an author who is so transparent about it, while evolving with the turn of every page. Cabeen has given us a charge, in the form of a book that will educate you, challenge you, provoke you, and speak to you. What impressed me most about Principal in Balance is how she embraces what Jim Collins called 'the genius of and' vs. 'the tyranny of or.' She doesn't offer the false dichotomy of a principal being effective as a leader 'or' living a balanced life. She offers relatable advice, relevant research, and practical tools to move school leaders down the path of being both effective at work and whole at home. Within two chapters, I found myself setting intentions to be a better version of myself.\"\n--Kenneth Williams, Nationally Recognized Trainer, Speaker, Coach and Consultant in leadership and school culture", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["#main", "https://www.wiley-vch.de/de?option=com_eshop&view=product&isbn=9781119885764&title=Principal%20in%20Balance", "/en/areas-interest/humanities-social-sciences/education-12ed/k-12-general-12ed1/leadership-administration-k-12-12ed11/principal-in-balance-978-1-119-88576-4", null, "/", "/de/", "#", "/de/shop/neuerscheinungen", "/de/fachgebiete", "/de/shop/bookfinder", "/de/shop/journals", "/de/shop/ebooks", "https://www.wiley-vch.de/de/shop/cart", "/de/shop/zusatzmaterial-vergriffener-titel", "#", "/de/fachgebiete/computer-und-informatik", "/de/fachgebiete/finanzen-wirtschaft-recht", "/de/fachgebiete/geistes-und-sozialwissenschaften", "/de/fachgebiete/hobby-und-freizeit", "/de/fachgebiete/hotelfach-und-gastronomie", "/de/fachgebiete/ingenieurwesen", "/de/fachgebiete/kunst-und-kultur", "/de/fachgebiete/mathematik-und-statistik", "/de/fachgebiete/medizin-und-gesundheit", "/de/fachgebiete/naturwissenschaften", "#", "/de/service/publizierende", "/de/service/bibliotheken", "/de/service/buchhandel", "/de/service/presse", "/de/service/anzeigen", "/de/service/industrie-und-firmen", "/de/service/dozierende", "/de/service/lizenzen-rechte", "/de/service/privatpersonen", "#", "/de/ueber-wiley/verlag-u-seine-geschichte", "/de/ueber-wiley/kontakt", "/de/ueber-wiley/wiley-weltweit", "/de/ueber-wiley/impressum", "/de/ueber-wiley/agb-widerrufsbelehrung", "/de/ueber-wiley/gesellschaften-und-partnerschaften", "/de/karriere", "http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/60/11198857/1119885760-8.pdf", "/de/ueber-wiley/agb-widerrufsbelehrung#versandkosten", "http://wiley-vch.e-bookshelf.de/ISBN/9781119885788?lang=dt", "http://www.amazon.de/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?__mk_de_DE=%C5M%C5Z%D5%D1&url=search-alias%3Ddigital-text&field-keywords=9781119885788", "http://wiley-vch.e-bookshelf.de/ISBN/9781119885771?lang=dt", "#product-description", "#product-tab1-content", "#product-tab2-content", "#product-tab3-content", "/de/info/worlwide", "/de/info/gesellschaften-und-partner", "/de/ueber-wiley/agb-widerrufsbelehrung", "/de/ueber-wiley/impressum", "/de/newsletter/wiley-vch-alerting-service", "https://www.facebook.com/WileyVCHVerlag", "https://twitter.com/WileyVCH", "https://www.youtube.com/user/Passion4Publishing", "https://de.pinterest.com/wileyvch/", "/de/social/social-media", "/de/ueber-wiley/impressum#datenschutz", "#", "http://www.wiley.com/go/copyright", "http://www.wiley.com", "http://2glux.com/projects/jumi"]}
