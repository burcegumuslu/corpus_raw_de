The site has been part of\nCarboEurope, NitroEurope and IMECC and has been selected to be one of the German Level 1 sites within the\nEuropean research infrastructure ICOS. Continuous measurements of NEE by EC, NPP by regular harvesting,\nlateral in- and outputs of carbon and nitrogen as well as climatic parameters have been conducted since 2001.\nAutomated chamber measurements of N2O and CH4 were conducted since 2007. Fluxes of these greenhouse\ngases (GHG) for the years 2001 \u2013 2006 were calculated based on a Fuzzy Logic model calibrated by means of the\nchamber measurements.\nIn this study we present NEE, NBP and full GHG balances of over two rotation periods (2001 \u2013 2004 and 2005 \u2013\n2009, respectively) comprising four times winter wheat, two times potatoes and one cropping period of oil seed\nrape, sugar beet and barley each.\nThe GHG balance is dominated by moderate losses of soil organic matter ( \u0018120 +/- 50 g C m-2 y-1) and by N2O\nemissions of about 0.17 g N2O-N m-2 y-1 (50 g C-eq m-2 y-1). The on-site emissions of GHG balance about 43\n% of the harvested carbon.", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
