UC Riverside scientists are studying whether they can turn edible plants like lettuce into mRNA vaccine fac ...", "sitename": "bionity.com", "date": "2021-09-20", "id": null, "license": null, "body": null, "comments": "", "commentsbody": null, "raw_text": null, "text": "Grow and eat your own vaccines?\nGrant enables study of plants as mRNA factories\nPiqsels\nIsrael Santana/UCR\nMessenger RNA or mRNA technology, used in COVID-19 vaccines, works by teaching our cells to recognize and protect us against infectious diseases.\nOne of the challenges with this new technology is that it must be kept cold to maintain stability during transport and storage. If this new project is successful, plant-based mRNA vaccines \u2014 which can be eaten \u2014 could overcome this challenge with the ability to be stored at room temperature.\nThe project\u2019s goals, made possible by a $500,000 grant from the National Science Foundation, are threefold: showing that DNA containing the mRNA vaccines can be successfully delivered into the part of plant cells where it will replicate, demonstrating the plants can produce enough mRNA to rival a traditional shot, and finally, determining the right dosage.\n\u201cIdeally, a single plant would produce enough mRNA to vaccinate a single person,\u201d said Juan Pablo Giraldo, an associate professor in UCR\u2019s Department of Botany and Plant Sciences who is leading the research, done in collaboration with scientists from UC San Diego and Carnegie Mellon University.\n\u201cWe are testing this approach with spinach and lettuce and have long-term goals of people growing it in their own gardens,\u201d Giraldo said. \u201cFarmers could also eventually grow entire fields of it.\u201d\nKey to making this work are chloroplasts \u2014 small organs in plant cells that convert sunlight into energy the plant can use. \u201cThey\u2019re tiny, solar-powered factories that produce sugar and other molecules which allow the plant to grow,\u201d Giraldo said. \u201cThey\u2019re also an untapped source for making desirable molecules.\u201d\nIn the past, Giraldo has shown that it is possible for chloroplasts to express genes that aren\u2019t naturally part of the plant. He and his colleagues did this by sending foreign genetic material into plant cells inside a protective casing. Determining the optimal properties of these casings for delivery into plant cells is a specialty of Giraldo\u2019s laboratory.\nFor this project Giraldo teamed up with Nicole Steinmetz, a UC San Diego professor of nanoengineering, to utilize nanotechnologies engineered by her team that will deliver genetic material to the chloroplasts.\n\"Our idea is to repurpose naturally occurring nanoparticles, namely plant viruses, for gene delivery to the plants,\" Steinmetz said. \"Some engineering goes into this to make the nanoparticles go to the chloroplasts and also to render them non-infectious toward the plants.\"\nFor Giraldo, the chance to develop this idea with mRNA is the culmination of a dream. \u201cOne of the reasons I started working in nanotechnology was so I could apply it to plants and create new technology solutions. Not just for food, but for high-value products as well, like pharmaceuticals,\u201d Giraldo said.\nHe is also co-leading a related project using nanomaterials to deliver nitrogen, a fertilizer, directly to chloroplasts, where plants need it most.\nNitrogen is limited in the environment, but plants need it to grow. Most farmers apply nitrogen to the soil. As a result, roughly half of it ends up in groundwater, contaminating waterways, causing algae blooms, and interacting with other organisms. It also produces nitrous oxide, another pollutant.\nThis alternative approach would get nitrogen into the chloroplasts through the leaves and control its release, a much more efficient mode of application that could help farmers and improve the environment.\nThe National Science Foundation has granted Giraldo and his colleagues $1.6 million to develop this targeted nitrogen delivery technology.\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited about all of this research,\u201d Giraldo said. \u201cI think it could have a huge impact on peoples\u2019 lives.\u201d\nOther news from the department science\n[\n](https://www.bionity.com/en/news/1181874/start-up-competition-m4-award-announces-winners.html)\nStart-up competition m4 Award announces winners\n2.5 million euros for five research teams from Bavaria\n[\n](https://www.bionity.com/en/news/1181876/plants-transformed-into-detectors-of-dangerous-chemicals.html)\nPlants transformed into detectors of dangerous chemicals\nScientists engineer plants to speak in color\n[\n](https://www.bionity.com/en/news/1181877/ai-identifies-antimalarial-drug-as-possible-osteoporosis-treatment.html)\nAI identifies antimalarial drug as possible osteoporosis treatment\nOsteoporotic mice treated with the drug had significantly improved bone density\n[\n](https://www.bionity.com/en/news/1181863/proven-for-the-first-time-the-microbiome-of-fruit-and-vegetables-positively-influences-diversity-in-the-gut.html)\nProven for the First Time: The Microbiome of Fruit and Vegetables Positively Influences Diversity in the Gut\nBacterial diversity in the gut plays an important role in human health\n[\n](https://www.bionity.com/en/news/1181864/genomic-stability-a-double-edged-sword-for-sharks.html)\nGenomic Stability: A Double-Edged Sword for Sharks\nSharks have long been said to have an exceptionally low cancer rate\n[\n](https://www.bionity.com/en/news/1181867/model-can-predict-the-evolution-of-new-covid-variants.html)\nModel can predict the evolution of new covid variants\nEvolutionary information can support the design of targeted vaccines\n[\n](https://www.bionity.com/en/news/1181851/ai-and-10-seconds-of-voice-can-screen-for-diabetes.html)\nAI and 10 seconds of voice can screen for diabetes\nScientists discover voice tech as potential game changer in Type 2 diabetes detection\n[\n](https://www.bionity.com/en/news/1181854/artificial-intelligence-predicts-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-research.html)\nArtificial intelligence predicts the future of artificial intelligence research\nAI algorithm predicts the direction in which your research field is likely to evolve\n[\n](https://www.bionity.com/en/news/1181841/new-insights-into-the-genetics-of-the-common-octopus-genome-at-the-chromosome-level-decoded.html)\nNew insights into the genetics of the common octopus: genome at the chromosome level decoded\nScientific milestone provides deeper insights into the evolution and biology of Octopus vulgaris\n[\n](https://www.bionity.com/en/news/1181845/is-the-genie-out-of-the-bottle-can-you-trust-chatgpt-in-scientific-writing.html)\nIs the Genie Out of the Bottle?
