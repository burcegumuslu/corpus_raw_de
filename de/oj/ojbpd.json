Theoretical models treating temperature-dependent electron-phonon coupling in vibronic spectra were presented and numerically tested. Furthermore molecular properties of bichromophoric systems were calculated using well-established methods. We focus on the interplay of electronic coupling and static disorder as well as energy transfer times and the influence of molecular bridges in dimers on the coupling. As electronic energy transfer is detectable using spectroscopic methods, temperature-dependent simulations of the line shape of vibronic transitions, coupled to a heat bath, were carried out. The required response function to determine the spectral line shape can be extracted from a cumulant expansion or alternatively from the generalized Redfield theory. Our starting point was a calculated density of states instead of the approximated vibronic structure within the Brownian oscillator model. Both pure electron-phonon coupling and vibration-phonon coupling are discussed for various spectral densities of the bath modes. In the course of a cooperation project we studied the electronic coupling in a homologous series of bridged rylene dimers with different interchromophoric distances. Results of low-temperature single molecule measurements and quantum chemical calculations based on a vibronic coupling model were interpreted, simultaneously. The reviewed dimers show a transition from strong to weak coupling as limiting cases and the averaged energy transfer times could be calculated in good agreement with experimental findings. As a molecular bridge between donor and acceptor unit modifies the electronic coupling, it can influence experimental measurements. Thus, we analyzed the effect of the polarizability of the bridge and through-bond interactions on the interchromophoric coupling to find appropriate types of spacers for experimental studies. All investigated types of bridges led to enhanced electronic couplings while the coupling strengths mainly were determined by bridge-mediated interactions.\n540 Chemistry and allied sciences", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["#content", "https://ub.uni-mainz.de", "#", "/mydspace", "/profile", "#", "/advanced-search", "/community-list", "/browse?type=author", "/browse?type=title", "/browse?type=dateissued", "/browse?type=dateavailable", "/browse?type=subject", "/browse?type=type", "/browse?type=department", "#", "https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/4278?locale=en", "https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/4278?locale=de", "#", "/help-faq", "/help-research", "/help-faq-search", "/help-publish", "https://www.ub.uni-mainz.de/de/dissertationen", "/contact", "/", "/handle/20.500.12030/1", "/handle/20.500.12030/2", "/browse?type=author&value=Roos%2C+Claudia", "https://ror.org/023b0x485", "http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-4276", "https://nbn-resolving.org/urn/resolver.pl?urn=nbn:de:hebis:77-37803", "https://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/", "/handle/20.500.12030/2", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/4278/1/3780.pdf", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/4278/1/3780.pdf", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/4278/1/3780.pdf", "/handle/20.500.12030/4278?mode=full", "/handle/20.500.12030/4278/statistics", "/imprint", "/privacy", "/contact", "/guidelines", "https://doi.org/10.18452/24678", "https://www.uni-mainz.de/"]}
