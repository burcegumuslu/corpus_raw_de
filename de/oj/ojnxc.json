Cancer-related fatigue (CRF), a multidimensional syndrome, is one of the most severe amongst symptoms\n[[1]](#ref1). It causes deep distress and a significant loss of patient\u2019s health-related quality of life (HRQL). First-line interventions such as exercise and physical activity are suggested to counter fatigue symptoms. Mind-body therapies in particular, such as yoga and meditation, have evident effectiveness, and music therapy is recommended for a reduction of anxiety and stress in breast cancer patients [[2]](#ref2). Argentine tango (AT), in its use of movement therapy and incorporation of music, can have an influence on physical, psychological and cognitive skills [[3]](#ref3). AT has not yet been reported to be used in the therapeutic care of breast cancer patients.\nQuestion and objective: In this study, a six week AT module (weekly 60 min sessions) is implemented to investigate whether it is suited as a therapeutic approach for breast cancer patients after primary oncological therapy, specifically as having a positive effect on their fatigue levels and their HRQL. AT modules are comprised of movement concepts that utilize elements adapted from Argentine tango.\nMethod: Sixty breast cancer patients with fatigue, who have been diagnosed with cancer stage I-III, and who have completed primary therapy, are recruited and randomized 1:1 to an AT or a waiting-list group\n[[4]](#ref4). The participants of the AT group receive six weeks of AT while the waiting-list group receives AT six weeks later. Cancer-related fatigue will be measured by the validated and reliable CFS-D questionnaire.\nResults: Patients\u2019 acceptance of the AT intervention among first recruited breast cancer patients is very high. The movement exercises aim to strengthen six fields: self-awareness, spatial/musical perception, social perception, playfulness, sensation, shared experience. The main focus lies on perceiving one\u2019s own individual body in movement and within a social context. First preliminary results will be discussed.\nDiscussion/Reflection: It is anticipated that the implementation of the AT intervention is feasible and that fatigue and HRQL will be improved by the suggested treatment. Furthermore, we anticipate that the interplay of the group experience, music, and the enjoyable movement patterns could be the reasons for breast cancer patients regular participation in AT lessons.\n[\nReferences\n] [1.]\n- Wang XS, Zhao F, Fisch MJ, O'Mara AM, Cella D, Mendoza TR, Cleeland CS.
