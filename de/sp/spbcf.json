A single peer has only a limited view on other peers. Thus, efficient searching for other peers or their content is a key performance indicator. In this paper, we investigate the search efficiency in an m-ary tree-structured P2P overlay. While previous work aimed for balancing the maximum height of a node's sub-trees, we show that keeping the height balanced throughout the overall network - a property called null-balance - will increase search performance considerably. Simulations using the ns-3 discrete-event simulator show 50% better performance w.r.t. required routing hops in these null-balanced trees. Therefore, we develop algorithms that keep a tree null-balanced if a node joins or departures. I.e., we prevent the need for restructuring. As we show, the cost of our efficient structure-preserving algorithms is easily set off by a relatively small number of search operations.\nAuthor(s)", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["", "javascript:void(0);", "javascript:void(0);", "/explore/researchoutputs", "/explore/fundings_and_projects", "/explore/researcherprofiles", "/explore/institute", "javascript:void(0);", "/home", "/", "/communities/8d35c5f7-6fd7-4cf5-9b68-3efa67de7dd2", "/collections/62dafb5d-399f-4d76-8547-7def2fe089da", "javascript:;", "javascript:;", "/items/11d9e6cd-0372-45a6-b4eb-d903d981aafe", "/search?configuration=researchoutputs&f.author=Detzner,%20Peter,equals", "/items/e8da4fea-3ab4-46cf-b804-66f1e06666f8", "/search?configuration=researchoutputs&f.author=G%C3%B6deke,%20Jana,equals", "/items/e8da4fea-3ab4-46cf-b804-66f1e06666f8", "/search?configuration=researchoutputs&f.author=Bondorf,%20Steffen,equals", "/items/1e811c69-c7c7-477b-8a73-62eb74495281", "/items/a1ddc4ca-6a32-42d8-8404-bf57990985c5", "https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN52139.2021.9525004", "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Low-Cost+Search+in+Tree-Structured+P2P+Overlays", "/items/e8da4fea-3ab4-46cf-b804-66f1e06666f8", "/search?configuration=researchoutputs&query=subject:(overlay%20network)", "/search?configuration=researchoutputs&query=subject:(peer-to-peer)", "/search?configuration=researchoutputs&query=subject:(balanced%20tree)", "javascript:void(0);", "/info/imprint", "/info/privacy", "/info/api", "/info/feedback"]}
