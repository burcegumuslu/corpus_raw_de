You will experience this motto in the introductory course \"Yoga ayurvedically inspired\", which starts our yoga teacher training at the same time. And if you are interested in meditation, you will find here tailor-made opportunities to enter the world of experience of meditation.\nThe educational offer of the European Academy for Ayurveda is modular. This makes you flexible: Decide for yourself how and when you want to learn Ayurveda.\nWith each training module you can see at first glance whether it conveys basic knowledge or deepens existing knowledge:\nBirstein, Berlin, Frankfurt, Vienna and Zurich - the Academy is where its participants are. In the Ayurveda classes on site you get first-hand knowledge, directly from the charismatic lecturers of the academy and in exchange with your fellow students.\nIn our webinars you take part in the lessons live and online. You enter a virtual classroom via a professional, easy-to-use tool. There you can actively participate in the lessons and ask the instructor questions.\nThe alternative for all those who want to be completely flexible in terms of time and place: You learn via your notebook or tablet in self-study with videos, audio files and interactive manuscripts.\nWe often offer face-to-face and web seminars on different days of the year. So you're sure to find a date when you have time.\nThe modules of a training course can also be booked individually as a seminar. Like in a modular system, the modules fit together to form a training. That means for you:\nThen let's talk - our office team is there to help and advise you.\nGet to know us and Ayurveda! On several dates throughout the year we invite you to an open campus, as a virtual event or on site in Birstein. Or you can come to an information meeting at our City Spots in Frankfurt, Vienna, Zurich and Lucerne.\nLook forward to exciting lectures, a guided tour and, of course, information about the Academy's training programs. Simply register and participate free of charge.", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": [null, "/nl/programs/trainings", "/nl/programs/trainings/trainings-in-english",
