Two essential features of the finite strain elastoplasticity concern the total energy principle and the concept of internal state variables satisfying non-holonomical constraints [4], [5]. The boundary value problem for elastoplastic cracked body at finite strain is derived from the variational inequality. The condition of crack propagation is associated with the asymptotically path-independent J-integrals. The algorithm of J-integral calculation is proposed.\n2012, ZAMM - Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics / Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik\n1992, Zeitschrift fu\u0308r angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik\nWithin the framework for finite strain elastoplasticity a new formulation of the boundary value problem for an elastoplastic cracked body by a variational inequality is proposed. A well-posed system of governing equations and boundary conditions derived from this variational inequality enables us to determine the location as well as the preferred direction of propagation of the crack. It is shown that the variational inequality of evolution along with the non-holonomical constraints can be used to formulate the dynamic problem for a thermoplastic cracked body. Im Rahmen einer elastoplastischen Theorie unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung gro\u00dfer Dehnungen wird eine neue Formulierung des Randwertproblems f\u00fcr einen elastoplastischen K\u00f6rper mit Rissen mit Hilfe einer Variationsungleichung vorgeschlagen. Ein korrekt gew\u00e4hltes System von Grundgleichungen und Randbedingungen, das von dieser Variationsungleichung hergeleitet wird, erm\u00f6glicht es, Ri\u00dfort sowie bevorzugte Ri\u00dfausbreitungsrichtung zu bestimmen. Ferner wird gezeigt, da\u00df die variationelle Evolutionsungleichung zusammen mit nicht-holonomen Zusatzbedingungen benutzt werden kann, um das dynamische Problem eines thermoplastischen K\u00f6rpers mit Rissen zu formulieren.\n2013, ZAMM - Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics / Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik\n2014, International Journal of Engineering Science\n2014, International Journal of Engineering Science\n2008, ZAMM-Journal of Applied \u2026\nMaterializing Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM), numerical modeling of discrete internal cracks, namely central bursts, in direct forward extrusion process is presented. Accordingly, in a thermodynamically consistent setting, a local Lemaitre variant damage model with quasi-unilateral evolution is coupled with hyperelastic-plasticity. The formulations are constructed in the principal axes where simultaneous local integration schemes are efficiently developed. To this end, the framework is implemented as ABAQUS/VUMAT subroutine to be used in an explicit FE solution scheme, and utilized in direct forward extrusion simulations for bearing steel, 100Cr6. Discontinuous cracks are obtained with the element deletion procedure, where the elements reaching the critical damage value are removed from the mesh. The periodicity of the cracks shows well accordance with the experimental facts. The investigations reveal that, application of the quasi-unilateral conditions together with the crack closure parameter has an indispensable effect on the damage accumulation zones by determining their internal or superficial character.\n1993, Zeitschrift fu\u0308r angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik\nLoading Preview\nSorry, preview is currently unavailable.

They get designed and built with much engineering ingenuity. For the remainder of their existence they then stay in place and are subjected to all kinds of external effects. Bridges are loaded by traffic, heated by the sun and subjected to wind and earthquake attacks. However, they perform their primary function passively. If they were equipped with active intelligence they would, for example when assaulted, block the traffic, take cover, and afterwards reopen.\n1984, ZAMM - Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics / Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik\n2014, Continuum Mechanics and Thermodynamics\nThe interaction between cars or trains and bridges has been often described by means of a simplified model consisting of a beam loaded by a traveling mass, or by a traveling oscillator. Among others, two aspects are essential when dealing with masses traveling along flexible vibrating supports: (i) a complete relative kinematics; and (ii) a continuous transition between a traveling mass, rigidly coupled, and a traveling oscillator, elastically coupled with the support. The kinematics is governed by normal and tangential components\u2014with respect to the curved trajectory\u2014of the acceleration. However in literature these parts are oriented with reference to the undeformed beam configuration. This model is improved here by a non-linear second-order enriched contribution. The transition between a traveling oscillator and a traveling mass is governed by the stiffness k of the elastic or viscoelastic coupling which, in the latter case (i.e. rigid coupling), has to tend towards infinity. However, very large stiffness values cause high frequencies and significant problems are mentioned in the literature in order to establish numerically stable and reliable results and in order to realize a continuous evolution between absolute and relative formulations. By using mixed state variables, generalized displacements and coupling forces, the contribution from the stiffness changes from k to its inverse 1/k, the coupling force itself becomes a member of the solution-space and the problems, which have been mentioned in the literature, disappear. As a matter of fact, the coupling force can also take into account a viscoelastic contribution; moreover, a larger number of traveling oscillators can be considered, too. Finally, for a periodic sequence of moving oscillators the dynamic stability is treated in the time-domain along several periods, as well as in the spectral domain, by using Floquet\u05f3s theorem.\n2003\n2014, ZAMM - Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics / Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik\n2004, Zamm-zeitschrift Fur Angewandte Mathematik Und Mechanik\nIn this paper the authors prove a uniqueness theorem for the electric detection of cavities in a three dimensional solid from Cauchy data measured on the surface. The cavities, finite in number, are assumed to be insulating. The surfaces of the cavities are assumed to be smooth on the complement of a set that is, in some sense, negligible.\n2019, Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements\nFor the Trefftz method sequences of linear independent functions satisfying the governing differential equations are needed. For two- and three-dimensional elasticity problems some useful options for obtaining Trefftz trial functions are discussed. The discussion also includes some very useful particular solutions. For three-dimensional elasticity problems four methods are considered: the displacement representation of Papkovich/Neuber, Piltner's complex representation, a hypercomplex displacement representation of Bock, G{\\\"u}rlebeck, Weisz-Patrault, Legatiuk, and H.M. Nguyen, as well as Slobodyanskii's representation written in real and complex form. For two-dimensional problems the option of using discretized Cauchy integrals is illustrated. Very briefly Trefftz type Radial Basis Functions are mentioned satisfying a homogeneous or inhomogeneous differential equation. This paper is not meant as a complete survey or review on Trefftz methods. The paper presents a collection of personal choices to help future developers of numerical methods based on Trefftz trial functions. Keywords: Trefftz method, Radial Basis Functions, Discretized Cauchy integrals, Elasticity solutions, Data interpolation.\n2010\n2014, Continuum Mechanics and Thermodynamics\n2014, Forsch Ingenieurwes\nIn the present work the contact interaction of a long cylindrical shell with a coaxial cylindrical wrap made of a composite material is investigated. The composite material is modeled as a homogeneous orthotropic medium with known effective elastic properties. Based on the classical shell theory governing equations for the contact problems and general solutions to the deflections and internal forces are formulated. The unknown integration constants and the contact surface area are determined numerically using the software package Maple. Three characteristic lengths of the wrap, for which the transition from one contact mode to another takes place, have been determined. It was found that the change in the internal pressure does not affect the transition between the contact modes. The nature of the contact interaction is determined by the geometric parameters of the contact pair and elastic material properties of the shell and the repair wrap.\n1997, ZAMM - Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics / Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik\n2009\nAbstract In various structural design and optimization problems it is necessary to repeatedly evaluate the response of the structure for numerous modified designs. Specifically, mechanical and geometrical parameters may change and eventually structural components can be added or deleted leading also to a change in the number of the degrees of freedom in the pertinent finite element model.\n2011, Zamm-zeitschrift Fur Angewandte Mathematik Und Mechanik\n1993, Zeitschrift fu\u0308r angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik\n2012, ZAMM - Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics / Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik\nPost-buckling analyse for round steel tubes with different wall thickness.

The importance of stability theory to various \u00aeelds of engineering and applied science is pointed out and the history of the discipline is brie\u00afy sketched. The principal accomplishments are succinctly reviewed, and fruitful recent trends, particularly the stability analysis of damage localization and fracture, are emphasized. Only selected references are given. #\n2011, ZAMM - Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics / Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik\nIn the present work, we show that the linearized homogenized model for a pantographic lattice must necessarily be a second gradient continuum, as defined in Germain (1973). Indeed, we compute the effective mechanical properties of pantographic lattices following two routes both based in the heuristic homogenization procedure already used by Piola (see Mindlin, 1965; dell'Isola et al., 2015a): (i) an analytical method based on an evaluation at micro-level of the strain energy density and (ii) the extension of the asymptotic expansion method up to the second order. Both identification procedures lead to the construction of the same second gradient linear continuum. Indeed, its effective mechanical properties can be obtained by means of either (i) the identification of the homogenized macro strain energy density in terms of the corresponding micro-discrete energy or (ii) the homogenization of the equilibrium conditions expressed by means of the principle of virtual power: actually the two methods produce the same results. Some numerical simulations are finally shown, to illustrate some peculiarities of the obtained continuum models especially the occurrence of bounday layers and transition zones. One has to remark that available well-posedness results do not apply immediately to second gradient continua considered here.\n1997, ZAMM - Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics / Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik\n1991, International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences & Geomechanics Abstracts\n1999, European Journal of Mechanics - B/Fluids\n2012, ZAMM - Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics / Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik\nComputer Assisted Mechanics and Engineering Sciences\nn this paper we discuss two multi-scale procedures, both of mathematical nature as opposed to purely numerical ones. Examples are shown for the two cases. Attention is also devoted to thermodynamical aspects such as thermodynamic consistency and non- equilibrium thermodynamics. Advances for the first aspect are obtained by adopting the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory TCAT as shown in the case of a stress tensor for multi-component media. The second aspect has allowed to solve numerically, with relative ease, the case of non-isothermal leaching. The absence of proofs of thermodynamic consistency in case of asymptotic theory of homogenization with finite size of the unit cell is also pointed out.\n1999, European Journal of Mechanics -
