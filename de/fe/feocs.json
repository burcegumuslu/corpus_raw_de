We need urgent \nglobal action, using a One Health approach, to keep our precious medicines working. One \nof the critical health targets of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals is for access to safe, \neffective and affordable medicines for all. In the case of antibiotics and other antimicrobials, \nusing them carefully is vital to maintaining their effectiveness.\nThe inappropriate use and overuse of antibiotics are driving a global increase in AMR and \nhave a pernicious impact on the effectiveness of these critical medicines. It threatens to \nsend us back to the pre-antibiotic era, when a routine infection could mean death. Through \nthe Global Action Plan on AMR, WHO is working to improve the surveillance of antimicrobial \nresistance and reduce inappropriate antibiotic consumption.\nThe new AWaRe antibiotic book, produced as an adjunct to WHO\u2019s Essential Medicines \nList (EML), provides concise, evidence-based guidance for more than 30 of the most \ncommon clinical infections in children and adults in both primary health care and \nhospital settings. The EML has been a key strategic component of WHO\u2019s goal to improve \nthe use of medicines since 1977. The latest version of the EML, published in 2021, \nincludes 39 antibiotics out of 479 medicines, reflecting the vital role these medicines \nplay in health care.\nGiven the urgency of the threat to human health from AMR, and the many clinical infections \nfor which antibiotics play a lifesaving role, WHO took a pragmatic approach to developing \nsimple, practical guidance on how they should be used. The AWaRe system groups the \nhundreds of different antibiotics used globally into three simple categories \u2013 Access, \nWatch and Reserve \u2013 based on their clinical importance and the risk of their use promoting \nresistance. The AWaRe antibiotic book provides clear guidance on the choice of antibiotic, \nformulation, dose and duration for essential antibiotics for hospital and primary health care \nsettings, including guidance on when not to use antibiotics.\nThere is an urgent need to develop and implement clear, globally accepted indicators, \nbuilding on the AWaRe system, to promote the appropriate use of antibiotics and reduce \ntheir inappropriate use. Many challenges remain, including how data should inform local \npolicies, and how to change patterns of medicine use formed over decades, particularly in \nlow- and middle-income countries.vi The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  Foreword\nThe 2022 AWaRe book is an important step along the road towards the improved use of \nantibiotics in humans, the development of stronger AMR policy and better clinical care.\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus\nWHO Director-GeneralThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book viiAcknowledgements\nThe World Health Organization (WHO)

specifically refers to bacteria \nbecoming resistant to antibiotics (medicines that act against bacteria).\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR)\nAMR is the ability of bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites to resist the effects of antimicrobial \nmedicines that kill susceptible organisms or keep them from growing.\nAntimicrobial resistance predates the use of antimicrobials in human medicine and many \nbacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites are intrinsically resistant to some antimicrobials. \nMicroorganisms can also acquire resistance by being exposed to antimicrobials.\nInfection with antimicrobial-resistant pathogens makes infections harder to treat and \nincreases the risk of disease spread, severe illness and death. \nAntiseptics\nAntiseptics are antimicrobial products used to slow or stop the growth of microorganisms. \nThey are usually used on the skin or mucous membranes, for example, the mouth. These \ninclude, for example, chlorhexidine. These products can be used as hand rubs, hand or \nmouth washes and skin preparations.\nAccess, Watch and Reserve (AWaRE) classification\nAWaRe is the WHO classification of antibiotics introduced by WHO as part of the 2017 Model \nList of Essential Medicines. \nIn the AWaRe classification, there are three categories of antibiotics:\n\u2022 Access antibiotics that have a narrow spectrum of activity and a good safety \nprofile in terms of side-effects. \n\u2022 Watch antibiotics that are broader-spectrum antibiotics and are recommended \nas first-choice options for patients with more severe clinical presentations or for \ninfections where the causative pathogens are more likely to be resistant to Access \nantibiotics. \n\u2022 Reserve antibiotics that are last-choice antibiotics used to treat multidrug-\nresistant infections.\nThis classification can be used to give an indirect indication of the appropriateness of \nantibiotic use. The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a target that at least 60% \nof global antibiotic consumption at the national level should be from the Access group.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book xiGlossary  \uf067\nCarbapenemases\nCarbapenemases are beta-lactamases, enzymes that can break the beta-lactam ring (an \nessential component of beta-lactam antibiotics) and make penicillins, cephalosporins, \nmonobactams and carbapenems ineffective. \nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) \nCOVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome \ncoronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-2). The first human cases of COVID-19 were reported in December \n2019. \nC-reactive protein\nC-reactive protein is a laboratory test used to detect inflammation as an indicator of various \nconditions, including bacterial infection, and to monitor response to treatment.\nDisability-adjusted life years (DALYs)\nDALYs are an indicator used to assess the overall burden of disease. It is a time-based measure \nthat combines years of life lost due to premature mortality and years of healthy life lost due \nto disability. One DALY represents the loss of the equivalent of one year of full health.\nModel List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics \nThe WHO Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics (or Essential Diagnostics List (EDL)) is \na list of in vitro diagnostics that are recommended by WHO and that was first published \nin 2018. The EDL can be used as a reference for programme and laboratory managers, \nand procurement and reimbursement officers who are developing or updating their own \nnational lists of essential diagnostics The list is updated every one to two years based on \nproposed additions and changes submitted to WHO by stakeholders and reviewed by the \nWHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on In Vitro Diagnostics (SAGE-IVD).\nEnzyme immunoassay \nAn enzyme immunoassay is a laboratory test that uses enzyme-labelled antibodies and \nantigens to detect biologic molecules. \nWHO Model List of Essential Medicines\nThe WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (or Essential Medicines List (EML)) is a list of those \nmedicines that satisfy the priority health care needs of the population. The first EML was \npublished in 1977. The EML includes the most efficacious, safe and cost-effective medicines \nfor priority conditions, selected on the basis of current and estimated future public health \nrelevance, evidence of effectiveness and safety, and cost\u2013effectiveness. The EML is updated \nevery 2 years based on proposed additions and changes submitted to WHO by stakeholders \nand reviewed by the WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines.xii The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  Glossary\nWHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children\nThe WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children (or Essential Medicines List for \nChildren (EMLc)) is a list of those medicines that satisfy the priority health care needs for \nchildren up to 12 years of age. The first EMLc was published in 2007. The EML includes \nthe most efficacious, safe and cost-effective medicines for priority conditions in children, \nselected on the basis of current and estimated future public health relevance, evidence of \neffectiveness and safety, and cost\u2013effectiveness. The EMLc is updated every 2 years based \non proposed additions and changes submitted to WHO by stakeholders and reviewed by \nthe WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines.\nExtended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)\nESBLs are a group of beta-lactamases, enzymes that can break the beta-lactam ring, which is \nan essential component of beta-lactam antibiotics, thus making penicillins, cephalosporins \nand monobactams (but not carbapenems) ineffective.\nGenotypic resistance \nGenotypic resistance is a type of resistance of an organism to an antibiotic or antibiotics \ndue to genetic mutation and expression of resistance genes. It is determined by methods \nof antimicrobial susceptibility testing that detect resistance genes. This information may be \nimportant for choosing the correct antibiotic and for epidemiological and surveillance reasons. \nGlutamate dehydrogenase \nGlutamate dehydrogenase is a constitutive enzyme produced by all strains of Clostridioides \ndifficile  and it is easily detected in stool samples. \nGlobal Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS)\nThe GLASS is the WHO surveillance system for antimicrobial resistance and use launched \nin 2015 to collect official national data in selected bacterial pathogens causing common \ninfections in humans\nIntramuscular\nRoute of administration of an injection to deliver a medication deep into the muscles.\nIntravenous\nRoute of administration of an injection or infusion to deliver a medication into a vein.\nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA)\nMRSA are strains of Staphylococcus aureus  that are resistant to methicillin and other beta-\nlactam antibiotics due to the presence of the mecA  (or sometimes mecC ) gene which \nproduces a different penicillin-binding protein with lower affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book xiiiGlossary  \uf067\nMicrobiota\nMicrobiota is a collective term for the microorganisms that live in or on the human body.\nNucleic acid amplification test \nNucleic acid amplification is a laboratory test used to detect a particular nucleic acid \nsequence to identify virus or bacteria in different biological samples.

Introduction\nThere is a clear need for simple resources to improve the quality of antibiotic prescribing \nglobally. The AWaRe book was designed as a tool to make the antibiotics section of the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) and Model List of \nEssential Medicines for Children (EMLc) more helpful to prescribers and to update the 2001 \nWHO model prescribing information (1) . \nAim and scope\nThe aim of the AWaRe book is to provide short, clinical guidance on the management of \ncommon infections, including recommendations for empiric antibiotic treatment at the first \nclinical presentation and when a \u201cno antibiotic\u201d approach is appropriate. Guidance is given \non the choice of antibiotics that should be used to treat the most likely bacterial pathogens \ncausing each infection in adults and children, the dosage and the treatment duration. \nThe AWaRe book is intended for all health care workers who prescribe and dispense \nantibiotics in high-, middle- and low-income settings in both the primary health care and \nthe facility/hospital setting. It aims to complement the WHO policy guidance on integrated \nantimicrobial stewardship activities  and the toolkit for health care facilities in low- and \nmiddle-income countries (2,3) . The AWaRe book is not intended to replace existing local \nand national antibiotic prescribing guidelines and clinical judgment, but to provide simple \nguidance where currently none is available. \nMethods\nThe antibiotic treatment recommendations outlined in the AWaRe book are based on \nreviews of the evidence undertaken for the 2017, 2019 and 2021 updates of the EML and \nEMLc. The EML and EMLc provide a list of safe and effective antibiotics that should be \navailable and affordable for patients globally. The AWaRe book provides guidance on how to \nbest use these antibiotics based on the principles of the Access, Watch and Reserve (AWaRe) \nframework (Box 1.1).2 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  1. Introduction\nBox 1.1 \u2013 Principles of the AWaRe framework\n\u2022 Maximizing clinical effectiveness \n\u2022 Minimizing toxicity \n\u2022 Minimizing unnecessary costs to patients and health care systems\n\u2022 Reducing the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance (i.e. prioritizing antibiotics that \nare less likely to lead to antibiotic resistance in an individual patient and the community)\n\u2022 Parsimony (i.e. avoiding the inclusion of many similar antibiotics)\n\u2022 Simplification (i.e. same Access antibiotic recommended for multiple indications)\n\u2022 Alignment with existing WHO guidelines\nThe detailed reviews on the optimal choice of antibiotics to be used for each specific \nclinical infection were based on a standardized analysis of systematic reviews, meta-analyses \nand clinical practice guidelines by experts in evidence-based medicines from McMaster \nUniversity (Hamilton, Canada). \nDetails of the evidence underlying the recommendations and the methodology can \nbe found in the following publications: \n\u2022 The selection and use of essential medicines: report of the WHO Expert Committee, \n2017 . WHO technical report series; 1006 (4).\n\u2022 The selection and use of essential medicines: report of the WHO Expert Committee \non Selection and Use of Essential Medicines, 2019 . WHO technical report series; \n1021 (5).\n\u2022 The selection and use of essential medicines: report of the WHO Expert Committee \non Selection and Use of Essential Medicines, 2021 . WHO technical report series; \n1035 (443) .\nThe choice of antibiotics to use for each specific infection are formal \nrecommendations based on the evaluation made by the EML Expert Committee on the \nevidence presented for the EML updates or derived from existing WHO guidelines where \navailable. The AWaRe book also provides guidance on diagnosis, symptomatic treatment \nand treatment duration based on non-systematic reviews of the literature and expert \nopinion. Some factors to be considered when using the AWaRe book are outlined in Box 1.2.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 31. Introduction   \uf067\nBox 1.2 \u2013 General considerations about the use of the AWaRe book\nAs with any general guidance document, the individual circumstances of the patients need \nto be considered. Comorbidities (e.g. immunosuppression which changes the pathogens that \nneed to be considered, or renal or hepatic insufficiency which may require dose adaption \nof antibiotics), concomitant medications (risk of interactions), pregnancy and breastfeeding \nstatus (some antibiotics may be contraindicated), allergies (see the chapter on allergies to \nantibiotics) and national regulations all may require an adaption of the guidance and it is the \nresponsibility of each prescriber to make sure that all these considerations are taken \ninto account when prescribing an antibiotic .\nPatients should be informed about the most common side-effects of the antibiotic, how it \nshould be stored and taken, how long to take it for and what to do if symptoms worsen or fail \nto improve and how leftover antibiotics should be properly disposed of.\nStructure\nThere are separate chapters for 35 infections, divided for ease of use into primary health \ncare and hospital facility sections fully acknowledging that there is overlap between these \ngroups.\nEach chapter on a clinical infection includes:\n\u2022 Background information . The pathophysiology, epidemiology, global burden, \nmost common pathogens and how to make the clinical diagnosis, including \nassessing disease severity. \n\u2022 Diagnostic tools . As the availability of diagnostic tools varies considerably in \ndifferent settings, the empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on clinical \nsigns and symptoms. Relevant diagnostic tests (including imaging and laboratory \ntests) are suggested based on WHO Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics  \n(EDL) (6). The list of tests provided for each infection is not based on a formal \nassessment of their predictive value, but as a general guide of tests that could be \nclinically helpful, where available. \n\u2022 Treatment .

These include guidance on a risk-based prescribing approach with the no \nantibiotic care option, short standard durations across infections, rapid oral step down \nfrom intravenous antibiotics and standardized dosing to improve medicine purchasing and \nprogramme delivery.\nThe AWaRe book also includes chapters on the Reserve antibiotics listed in the 2021 \nEML and EMLc, the principles behind their selection and how these last-resort medicines \nshould be used to preserve their effectiveness. \nThe AWaRe book is available both in print and electronic formats. Downloadable \ninfographics with the key information for end-users are also provided for each infection (see \nWeb Annex).The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 52. Improving the use of antibiotics \nwith the AWaRe book\nBackground\nAbout 90% of all antibiotics are taken by patients in the primary health care setting. It is \nestimated that around half of all antibiotic use is inappropriate in some way, such as: the \nuse of an antibiotic when none is indicated; the choice of an antibiotic with unnecessarily \nbroad spectrum (e.g. Watch instead of Access antibiotics; see the following section); and the \nwrong dose, duration of treatment, and delivery or formulation of the antibiotic (7).\nNote\nThe term antibiotic stewardship is preferred to antimicrobial stewardship and is used \nthroughout the AWaRe book to acknowledge the fact that the book only provides guidance on \nantibiotic treatment. \nAWaRe \nThe AWaRe book gives guidance on first- and second-choice antibiotics for common \ninfections in line with the recommendations in the EML and EMLc (8,9) . WHO has \nclassified antibiotics into four groups, Access, Watch, Reserve (AWaRe) and a fourth \u2013 Not \nRecommended \u2013 group. As well as the antibiotics in the EML and EMLc, more than 200 \nother antibiotics have now been classified into AWaRe groups to help inform local and \nnational policy development and implementation (10). \nAccess  antibiotics have a narrow spectrum of activity, lower cost, a good safety \nprofile and generally low resistance potential. They are often recommended as empiric first- \nor second-choice treatment options for common infections (see Box 2.1 for WHO\u2019s target \nfor their use).\nWatch  antibiotics are broader-spectrum antibiotics, generally with higher costs \nand are recommended only as first-choice options for patients with more severe clinical \npresentations or for infections where the causative pathogens are more likely to be resistant \nto Access antibiotics, such as upper urinary tract infections (UTIs). \nReserve  antibiotics are last-choice antibiotics used to treat multidrug-resistant \ninfections (see chapter on Reserve antibiotics). 6 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  2. Improving the use of antibiotics with the AWaRe book\nThe AWaRe system is also represented as a traffic-light approach: Access = green, \nWatch = orange and Reserve = red. Simple graphics using the traffic light approach can be \nused to show the proportions of Access and Watch antibiotics used in settings such as a \ncommunity clinic or pharmacy or as part of central monitoring of antibiotic consumption. \nCountries, regions and districts are encouraged to use the AWaRe book as a basis \nfor developing their own quality indicators and targets for safely reducing total levels of \ninappropriate antibiotic prescribing to improve patient safety and care, while reducing \nresistant infections and costs for patients and health systems (see Box 2.2 for goals of the \nAWaRe book).\nBox 2.1 \u2013 WHO target for the use of Access antibiotics\nTo promote responsible use of antibiotics and slow the spread of antibiotic resistance, the WHO \nGlobal Programme of Work includes a target that at least \u201c 60% of total antibiotic prescribing \nat the country level should be Access antibiotics by 2023 \u201d (11,12)\nBox 2.2 \u2013 Improving the use of antibiotics with the AWaRe book\n\u2022 No antibiotic care \u2013 safely reducing antibiotic use\n\u2022 Improving Access antibiotic use and reducing inappropriate use of oral and IV Watch antibiotics \n\u2022 Reducing the use of Not Recommended antibiotics \n\u2022 Improving AWaRe-ness!\n\u2022 Improving appropriate antibiotic dosing and duration\nNo antibiotic care \u2013 safely reducing antibiotic use\nKey messages\n\u2022 Most otherwise healthy patients with mild common infections can be treated without \nantibiotics  as these infections are frequently self-limiting and the potential medicine-\nrelated adverse events outweigh the clinical benefits.\n\u2022 The risks of taking antibiotics when they are not needed should always be considered, such as \nside-effects, allergic reactions, Clostridioides difficile  infection and selection of resistant bacteria.\n\u2022 Patients treated with symptomatic care only (no antibiotic care) should be clearly informed \nof what danger signs to monitor and what to do if they occur.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 72. Improving the use of antibiotics with the AWaRe book   \uf067\nManagement of low risk (mild) infections in primary health care\nMost infections encountered in primary health care are not caused by bacteria (e.g. most \nrespiratory tract infections have a viral cause) and therefore the patient will not benefit \nfrom antibiotic treatment (Table 2.1). Even when the cause of the infection is bacterial, \nmany infections are frequently self-limiting, with a low risk of severe complications and \nthe benefit of antibiotics is limited, shortening of the duration of symptoms by usually \nonly around 1 or 2 days. Most otherwise healthy patients with mild infections may safely \nreceive symptomatic treatment alone, such as anti-inflammatory medicines, pain killers or \ncomplementary medicines. Whenever appropriate, guidance on diagnosing mild infections \nthat can be treated with No Antibiotic Care is given in the AWaRe book.\nTable 2.1 \u2013 Common infections in primary health care where mild cases can be \nsafely treated with No Antibiotic Care (i.e. symptomatic management only) \u2013 see \nindividual chapters for more details\nInfection (in \nalphabetical \norder)Can it be safely \ntreated without \nantibiotics?Comment\nAcute diarrhoea Yes, in the great \nmajority of cases \n(unless there is \nsignificant bloody \ndiarrhoea)Most cases do not require antibiotic \ntreatment because the infection is of viral \norigin and the illness is usually self-limiting \nregardless of the causative pathogen. \nThe cornerstone of treatment is rehydration \nand electrolyte replacement.\nBronchitis Yes Nearly all cases have a viral origin and there \nis no evidence that antibiotics are needed.\nCOPD \nexacerbations Yes, in most mild \ncasesMost exacerbations of COPD are not \ntriggered by bacterial infections; only certain \ncases will benefit from antibiotic treatment.\nDental infections Yes, in most mild \ncasesDental treatment rather than prescribing \nantibiotics is generally more appropriate in \nthe management of dental infections.\nOtitis media Yes, in most mild \ncasesMost mild cases of acute otitis media can \nbe managed symptomatically and do not \nrequire antibiotic treatment.\nPharyngitis Yes, in most mild \ncasesMost cases do not require antibiotics \nbecause the infection is viral.a\ncontinues8 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  2.

However, on average, around \nhalf of patients presenting with any infection in primary care still receive an antibiotic, \nthus contributing to the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) (14). It \nis therefore important that both health care professionals and patients consider the risks of \ntaking antibiotics when they are not needed. These risks include the immediate risk of side-\neffects of the medicine, most commonly diarrhoea or allergic reactions (such as a rash; see \nchapter on allergy to antibiotics) and rarely more serious side-effects. Bacteria in patients \nprescribed an antibiotic for a respiratory infection or a UTI \u2013 as examples of infections for \nwhich antibiotics are often prescribed \u2013 commonly develop antibiotic resistance to the \nprescribed (and other) antibiotics. These patients are also more likely to transmit resistant \nbacteria to other people (14). Patients with infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria \nare more likely to have a delayed clinical recovery (15). Furthermore, antibiotic treatment \nalters the patient\u2019s microbiota (i.e. all microorganisms that live in or on the human body), \nwith potential long-term consequences and an increased risk of infection by Clostridioides \ndifficile , a bacterium that can cause severe diarrhoea.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 92.

Improving the use of antibiotics with the AWaRe book\nBox 2.4 \u2013 The five objectives of the global action plan\n1. Improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance.\n2. Strengthen surveillance and research.\n3. Reduce the incidence of infection.\n4. Optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines . \n5. Ensure sustainable investment in countering antimicrobial resistance\nThe AWaRe book therefore aims to address one of the objectives of the WHO global \naction plan \u201cOptimize the use of antimicrobial medicines\u201d with a focus on antibacterial \nmedicines or antibiotics (antimicrobials also include antifungal, antiviral and antiprotozoal \nmedicines). The AWaRe book provides guidance on when not to prescribe antibiotics and, if \nindicated, which antibiotics to prescribe for the most common infections. The AWaRe book \nfocusses on the optimal use of Access antibiotics as they remain the first-choice options for \nmost infections. \nThe AWaRe book recommends that nine of the 10 most common infections seen \nin primary health care can be treated safely with either no antibiotics or Access antibiotics \n(Table 2.2). Only one infection, acute bloody diarrhoea (dysentery), requires the empiric \ntreatment with antibiotics in the Watch category, such as ciprofloxacin or azithromycin. \nThe use of oral Watch antibiotics globally is increasing. They are now very commonly \ntaken by patients in primary health care for minor infections (fever/cough/diarrhoea) in both \nhigh-income countries and low- and middle-income countries. Reducing the inappropriate \nuse of both oral and intravenous Watch antibiotics is a critical strategy for the global control \nof antibiotic resistance, while ensuring vulnerable populations have continued or, where \nappropriate, improved access to Access antibiotics.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 112.

Improving the use of antibiotics with the AWaRe book   \uf067\nReducing the use of Not Recommended antibiotics\nKey messages\n\u2022 The wide use of fixed-dose combinations of antibiotics that are not compatible with the \nEML and not approved by the major regulatory agencies is of concern. Their use should be \nreduced as these combinations may result in increased toxicity and selection of resistance.\n\u2022 WHO has developed a list of fixed-dose combinations of antibiotics whose use is strongly \ndiscouraged (10).\nIn some countries, there is substantial use of fixed-dose combinations of antibiotics, \nwhich contain two or more agents in a single formulation. Recent data suggest that these \ncombinations represent up to 20% of global antibiotic prescribing, especially in middle-\nincome countries (17). Some fixed-dose combinations of antibiotics are well established \n(e.g. sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim) but other combinations often consisting of two or \nmore broad-spectrum antibiotics, combined with antifungal and probiotic agents are of \nconcern because they may contribute to the emergence and spread of AMR.\nImproving AWaRe-ness!\nKey messages\n\u2022 All prescribers and dispensers have a responsibility to improve the use of antibiotics.\n\u2022 Patients also have responsibilities and efforts should be made to ensure they know basic \nprinciples of appropriate antibiotic use (e.g. taking antibiotics as prescribed and not using \nleftover antibiotics for a later illness) and symptomatic care.\nAll prescribers, dispensers and users of antibiotics, including both private and public \nproviders, have a clear responsibility to ensure the best use of the medicines they give or \ntake. Table 2.3 outlines some of the responsibilities of these various stakeholders. The aim is \nto provide a general framework of responsibility with broad examples that could lead into a \nprogramme of interventions.14 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  2.

WHO estimates that up \nto one in 10 medical products in low- and middle-income country settings are substandard \nor falsified with antibiotics amongst the most commonly reported (18). These products \nare typically found in informal market settings, which are a major source of antibiotics for \npatients globally, but also in less well-regulated pharmacies. All those involved in giving \nantibiotics to patients should take all reasonable steps to ensure that good quality medicinal \nproducts are provided, which are registered and licensed by the relevant national medicines \nregulatory authorities. Guidance on how to identify a possible problem of substandard and \nfalsified medicinal antibiotics is provided in the WHO publication: Substandard and falsified \nmedical products  (18). \nCommunity health care workers\nCommunity health care workers include informal health care providers, that is providers \nwith no or limited formal training. In rural areas in low- and middle-income country settings, The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 172. Improving the use of antibiotics with the AWaRe book   \uf067\nthey are often the first medical contact for many people in the community. Antibiotics are \ncommonly prescribed by these informal providers, including the inappropriate prescription \nof broad-spectrum antibiotics or frequent prescription of antibiotics to treat upper \nrespiratory tract infections that are often of viral origin (19).\nImproved antibiotic use could be helped by further education of this sector with a \nfocus on the optimal use of Access antibiotics. Educational activities and training on how \nto manage common infections using the AWaRe book could be considered, for example, \nto decrease the use of oral Watch antibiotics and limit the use of antibiotics for severe \ninfections only.\nAppropriate antibiotic dosing and duration\nKey messages\n\u2022 Prescribers should always consult local and national dosing guidelines, where available.\n\u2022 The dosing guidance provided in the AWaRe book is for the most common clinical \ninfections in patients with normal kidney and liver function but the need for dose \nadjustments should always be considered.\n\u2022 The guidance on duration of treatment is generally the shortest suggested duration \nfor specific infections. More severe infections or patients with underlying conditions or \nimmunosuppression may require longer courses of treatment than suggested in the AWaRe \nbook.\nOther relevant WHO resources (please check regularly for updates)\n\u2022 WHO report on consensus guidance on paediatric dosing regimens for access antibiotics on \nthe essential medicines list for children (20). \nFor each infection discussed in the AWaRe book, guidance is given for both children and \nadults on the dose of antibiotic to be prescribed, how often the dose should be taken, the \nroute of administration of the antibiotic and the duration of antibiotic treatment. \nThe guidance is based on: (i) existing WHO guidelines, (ii) a review of recent literature, \n(iii) a review of recent guidelines from different WHO regions and (iv) expert opinion (the \nEML Antimicrobial Working Group). \nUsers of the AWaRe book should be aware of the limited evidence underlying many \nantibiotic prescribing strategies, particularly the very poor evidence for dosing guidance for \nolder antibiotics (when approval processes were less stringent and methods to determine 18 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  2. Improving the use of antibiotics with the AWaRe book\npharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment less developed), which may explain \nsome of the variation in international recommendations. The AWaRe book therefore does not \nprovide formal recommendations for dosage, frequency of use, route of administration and \nduration, but rather provides general guidance on what would be considered appropriate \ndosing strategies and duration in most clinical cases.\nDosing\nWherever appropriate the same dose is given for each antibiotic for all infections to help \nlocal procurement and prescribing. In the hospital facility section, guidance is also given on \nwhen to consider step down  from intravenous to oral antibiotics, encouraging the early \ndischarge of patients from hospital when clinically appropriate. \nGuidance on dose adjustments for abnormal kidney and liver function is not \ncovered, and the summary of product characteristics should be consulted. In addition, \ndetailed information on antibiotic administration, for example, the use of continuous or \nprolonged infusion times of beta-lactams in multidrug-resistant infections, is not covered as \nthis is beyond the scope of the AWaRe book (21,22) . \nEven though this dosing is not covered in the AWaRe book, higher doses or more \nfrequent administration may be required in certain situations such as: patients with very \nsevere infections (including sepsis / septic shock) or infections of certain body sites such as \ninfections of the central nervous system; patients with significant underlying disease (e.g. \nsevere immunosuppression); and overweight patients.\nDosing in children\nFor children, weight-based dosing was generally used for oral treatments based on WHO \nranges. For children weighing more than 30 kg, adult dosing should be considered. The \n2019 EML report on consensus guidance on paediatric dosing regimens was used as a \nreference but adapted by infection and severity of disease (20). \nTreatment duration\nFor treatment duration, where there was an acceptable range for the duration of therapy, the \nlowest number of days supported by the review of guidelines and expert opinion is used. \nStrong evidence-based guidance on the most appropriate duration of treatment \nfor many infections is limited. Therefore, duration is often individualized based on clinical \nresponse, on the success of surgical source control and, if available, changes in laboratory \nmarkers of infection. When an alternative diagnosis is established which does not require \nantibiotics, antibiotic treatment should be stopped. Shorter treatment where clinically \nappropriate is generally associated with less toxicity and a lower risk of selection and \ntransmission of antibiotic resistance, with equivalent clinical outcomes.  The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 192. Improving the use of antibiotics with the AWaRe book   \uf067\nIntravenous or oral antibiotics\nMost non-severe infections can be safely treated with oral antibiotics and this approach is \nencouraged as it has several advantages, for example, less risk of line-associated infections \nand avoidance of hospitalizations. However, this is provided that there is no risk of poor \nenteral absorption (e.g. no vomiting) or need to treat pathogens for which effective oral \noptions are not available, for example in the case of infections caused by certain multidrug-\nresistant pathogens. \nWhen intravenous treatment is started (e.g. for severe infections), rapid oral step \ndown should be considered as soon as this can be safely done.20 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book3. Allergy to antibiotics\nKey messages\n\u2022 True severe allergy to antibiotics is rare and allergies are often over-reported\n\u2022 Beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins and cephalosporins) of the Access group are among the \nmost effective and safe medicines for many infections, and they should only be avoided \nwhen there is a high suspicion of true allergy.\n\u2022 Cephalosporins and carbapenems can be safely used in most cases of non-severe penicillin \nallergy.\n\u2022 All patients who are labelled as allergic should be carefully evaluated and their antibiotic \nallergy risk level should be determined.\n\u2022 Routine skin testing before prescribing a beta-lactam antibiotic (e.g. penicillin or amoxicillin) \nis not needed, and direct oral challenge can be performed in carefully selected low-risk \nphenotypes.\nThe AWaRe book does not include alternative antibiotic options in cases of allergy to first-\nchoice antibiotics. The reason for this is that a true allergy to antibiotics (true meaning an \nallergic reaction that is immune-mediated) is rare and the AWaRe book focuses on the \nempiric treatment options for most patients. Beta-lactam antibiotics of the Access group \nare among the most effective and safe medicines for many infections. Avoiding the use of \nthis class, unless clearly justified because of severe allergy, exposes the patient to the risk of \nreceiving suboptimal treatment for their infection.\nThis chapter on allergy describes general principles of the mechanisms of allergies \nto antibiotics and the implications for treatment. From the perspective of antibiotic \nstewardship, it is important to avoid over-diagnosing antibiotic allergies. Such over-\ndiagnosis often occurs with antibiotics in the Access category (e.g. with penicillins) and \ncan lead to the subsequent prescription of antibiotics in the Watch category, for example, \nmacrolides that may be less effective and less safe. The detailed management of allergic \nreactions is beyond the scope of this chapter.\nDefinitions\n\u2022 An allergy  is a reaction of the immune system to a \u201cnon-self\u201d substance.\n\u2022 An adverse reaction  is a response to a medicine which is harmful and \nunintended, and which occurs at the doses normally used (23). Most adverse The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 213. Allergy to antibiotics   \uf067\nreactions can be  classified as type A or type B reactions (Table 3.1) depending on \nwhether or not their effects are related to the primary mechanism of action of the \nmedicine (type A, i.e. if they are predictable based on the mechanism of action or \nnot) and also whether the immune system is involved (type B, i.e. hypersensitivity \nreactions) (24). Most patients with type A adverse reactions (e.g. nausea, vomiting, \nheadache and injection site reactions) should not be labelled as having a beta-\nlactam allergy, to prevent avoidance of beta-lactam antibiotics.\n\u2022 A hypersensitivity reaction  is any adverse reaction that is immunologically \nmediated. Hypersensitivity reactions are type B reactions and can be classified based \non the timing of onset of symptoms after taking the antibiotic as well as on the \nunderlying mechanism, that is, immediate reactions (potentially IgE-mediated) or \ndelayed reactions (potentially T cell-mediated). Immediate reactions usually occur \nwithin 1\u20132 hours of taking the antibiotic and delayed reactions usually after more \nthan 6\u201324 hours. Reactions occurring within 2\u20136 hours are often called accelerated.\nTable 3.1 \u2013 Characteristics of adverse reactions to medicines\nType A (or on-target) adverse reactiona: \ncharacteristicsType B (or off-target) adverse reactiona: \ncharacteristics\n\u2022 Pharmacologically predictable\n\u2022 Dose/level dependent\n\u2022 Non-immune mediated\n\u2022 Less influenced by genetic factors\nExamples: antibiotic-associated diarrhoea \nand acute tubular necrosis due to \naminoglycosides\u2022 Pharmacologically unpredictable\n\u2022 Non-dose dependent\n\u2022 Often immunologically mediated \nhypersensitivity reactionsb (IgE or T-cell \nmediated)\nExamples: skin exanthema, angioedema or \nanaphylaxis (immune-mediated)\na On-target (or augmented) means the effects are related to the primary mechanism of action of the medicine. \nOff-target means the effects are not related to the primary mechanism of action of the medicine.\nb These reactions are immunologically mediated. They can be immediate (< 2 hours), accelerated (2\u20136 hours) or \ndelayed (> 6 hours) reactions based on when symptoms appear after the administration of the antibiotic.\nEpidemiology\nAllergies to medicines are frequently self-reported, especially for antibiotics (25) with 5\u201315% \nof patients in high-income countries reporting a penicillin allergy (24). However, in most \ncases (> 95%), these patients do not have a true immunologically mediated allergy and it is \nvery likely that they can tolerate the antibiotic if re-exposed or challenged (26).\nSevere allergies to antibiotics (e.g. anaphylactic shock) are rare; nonetheless, antibiotics \nare the most common cause of life-threatening immunologically mediated reactions (24). 22 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  3. Allergy to antibiotics\nAllergy to antibiotics is often over-diagnosed and patients are frequently labelled in health \nrecords as allergic to certain antibiotics (particularly to beta-lactams and sulfonamides) based \non an unverified, vague, unknown or old (e.g. > 10 years) history of allergy reported by the \npatient, most often rashes. In most cases, these patients are unlikely to have a true allergy to \nthe antibiotic and they will be able to safely tolerate it. Alternative explanations may exist for \nwhat the patients experienced previously, such as: (i) the antibiotic may have interacted with \na concomitant infection, for example, antibiotic\u2013infection interactions can occur in case of \nviral infections (e.g. the rash observed in patients with infectious mononucleosis caused by \nEpstein\u2013Barr virus exposed to amoxicillin); or (ii) there may have been an \u201cintolerance\u201d/type \nA adverse reaction of the antibiotic manifested as, for example, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea \nor headache; or (iii) a viral rash may have been confused with an allergic reaction. In addition, \nit is important to bear in mind that even true allergies are not always long-lasting and may \ndecrease or disappear over time (> 10 years) (26).\nThis over-diagnosis of allergy has important consequences because incorrectly \nlabelling a patient as allergic to an antibiotic often results in the unnecessary use of \nalternative antibiotics. These alternatives may be less effective for the infection being treated \nand may expose the patient to other (sometimes more toxic) side-effects. \nUnfortunately, most patients with a history of allergy to antibiotics are not evaluated \nto confirm the existence (or persistence) of the allergy. \nCross-reactivity\nAntibiotic cross-reactivity refers to the development of an allergic reaction to different \nsubstances that have a closely related structure, for example, cross-reactivity can occur \nbetween penicillin and other beta-lactams (Table 3.2) (26\u201328) , which may be due to an \nimmunological reaction to the beta-lactam ring shared by these antibiotics.\nIn patients with true allergy, cross-reactivity may occur and is generally \npredictable based on shared beta-lactam structures (e.g. R1 side chains), with the most \nfrequently encountered example being aminopenicillins (e.g. amoxicillin, ampicillin) and \naminocephalosporins such as cephalexin.\nTable 3.2 \u2013 Cross-reactivity to antibiotics\nPenicillins with other \nbeta-lactams% of cross-reactivityaSafety of use\nPenicillins and \ncephalosporins< 2 Cephalosporins can be safely \nused in most cases of penicillin \nallergy and vice versab.\ncontinuesThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 233.

Immediate and delayed reactions can be severe or non-severe.\nGastrointestinal symptoms and headache are not usually due to an allergic reaction \nbut rather to an intolerance of the antibiotic that can vary in intensity from person to person \nor to Clostridioides difficile  infection in case of diarrhoea. \nMost cases of allergic reactions to antibiotics are not severe and often present as mild \nskin reactions (most commonly mild rash, hives and itching) with no systemic symptoms.\nSevere reactions are rare but can become life-threatening. They can be immediate \nor delayed after administration of the antibiotic.\n\u2022 Immediate severe reactions should be suspected if there is airway involvement, \nbronchospasm, wheezing, angioedema (swelling of the tissue under the skin \nwith or without hives) or anaphylaxis. Usually, these reactions develop fewer than \n4 hours after taking the antibiotic.\n\u2022 Delayed severe reactions should be suspected in patients who have taken an \nantibiotic and present with severe skin symptoms (e.g. a painful blistering rash) and \nfever, joint pain or signs of organ involvement (e.g. hepatitis). Thrombocytopenia  24 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  3. Allergy to antibiotics\n(low platelet count), haemolytic anaemia (destruction of red blood cells) and \nsigns and symptoms of hepatitis or nephritis in severe cases are suggestive of \norgan involvement. Usually, these reactions develop more than 24 hours after \ntaking the antibiotic.\nAllergy evaluation \nAll patients who are labelled as allergic should be carefully evaluated and their antibiotic \nallergy risk level should be determined. When evaluating a patient, a full history of their \nallergy should be taken from the patient with details of past reactions, including timing \nrelative to antibiotic administration (immediate, intermediate, delayed or unknown) and \ntreatment received (if any). Patients can be classified into three risk categories for allergy to \nantibiotics: low, moderate, and high risk; see Table 3.3 for examples but other assessment \ntools are also available (29,30) . Detailed documentation of all elements of the allergy is \ncrucial. The patient should be educated about what types of antibiotics to avoid, if any, and \nshould be provided, if possible, with written information such as a so-called allergy passport.\nTable 3.3 \u2013 Antibiotic allergy risk levels based on the patient\u2019s allergy history\nAllergy risk \ncategoryExamples\nLow \u2022 Patients with a history of isolated symptoms consistent with intolerance \nof an antibiotic, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or headache\n\u2022 Patients with a history of mild skin reactions especially if > 5 years before \nassessment\n\u2022 Patients with local injection site reactions\n\u2022 Patients with a history of unknown reactions a long time ago without \nfeatures of immediate IgE-mediated reactions\n\u2022 Patients with a family history of antibiotic allergy\nModerate \u2022 Patients with a history of acute onset urticaria \n\u2022 Patients with a history of reactions that look like IgE-mediated reactions \nbut with no history of anaphylaxis\nHigh \u2022 Patients with a history of severe or life-threatening reaction (immediate \nor delayed) to an antibiotic (e.g. anaphylaxis, Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome \nor blistering or mucosal involvement rash)\n\u2022 Patients with a positive skin test\n\u2022 Patients with recurrent reactions or reactions to multiple antibiotics\nSource: Shenoy ES, et al (26). The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 253. Allergy to antibiotics   \uf067\nTesting techniques for patients at low and moderate risk of antibiotic allergy include \nskin tests (this applies only to IgE-mediated reactions) and direct oral challenge tests. In \ndirect oral challenge tests, a single therapeutic dose of the antibiotic is given orally to the \npatient under medical supervision with the ability to treat acute allergic responses. The \npatient should be kept under observation (usually at least 1-2 hours) to check for objective \nsigns of an allergic reaction. A detailed description of different types of tests available is \nbeyond the scope of this chapter. Routine skin testing before prescribing a beta-lactam \nantibiotic (e.g. penicillin and amoxicillin) is not needed in children or adults and should \nnot be recommended in guidelines as this is an unnecessary barrier to the use of Access \nantibiotics. \nIn settings where allergy testing, specialist advice or treatment for anaphylaxis \nare not available, then pragmatic decisions should be based on a detailed history of any \nreported possible penicillin allergy. A rapid risk assessment needs to be done, including \nthe medical importance of the infection the patient is presenting with (i.e. benefit\u2013risk \nassessment in that patient and whether an antibiotic is really needed) and the availability of \nalternative antibiotics with similar effectiveness. Please see the relevant infection chapters \nand symptomatic non-antibiotic treatment of minor infections within chapters.\nPatients with a definite history of immediate collapse, breathing difficulties or severe \nfacial swelling within a few minutes to 1\u20132 hours of taking a penicillin class of antibiotic are \nlikely to have had a true anaphylactic reaction. If any alternative antibiotics are available, they \nare preferred. Patients who have only had gastrointestinal symptoms or a rash appearing a \nfew days after receiving an antibiotic of the penicillin group and who have shown no signs \nof becoming seriously unwell are generally less likely to develop severe anaphylaxis if they \nreceive such antibiotics again in the future. Therefore, if one of these antibiotics is the most \nappropriate and available treatment option, they can be given and the patient advised to \nstop it if they develop a new skin rash, especially if the onset is rapid, the rash is raised and \nitchy and/or accompanying symptoms are present such as shortness of breath.26 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic bookPRIMARY HEALTH CARE\u00a9 WHO / Yoshi ShimizuThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 29PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n4.

Bronchitis\nPathophysiology\nAcute bronchitis is caused by tissue damage of the bronchial wall and inflammatory \nresponse triggered by the proliferation of microorganisms in the affected bronchi.\nEpidemiology \nAcute bronchitis is a very common condition that can affect people of all ages, mostly during \nthe seasons when respiratory viruses are common. Smoking and exposure to air pollution \nare risk factors. Acute bronchitis is one of the most common reasons for consultations in the \nprimary health care setting and it is associated with frequent unnecessary use of antibiotics \nboth in children and adults (39\u201341) .\nMost likely pathogens\nA causative pathogen is not identified in most cases of acute bronchitis. Most cases of acute \nbronchitis are of viral origin (Table 4.1).\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Pathogens most frequently associated with acute bronchitis (in \ndescending order of frequency)\nRespiratory viruses\nRhinovirus\nInfluenza virus (A and B)\nParainfluenza virus \nCoronavirus (including SARS-CoV-2)\nRespiratory syncytial virus \nMetapneumovirus\nAdenovirus\nOther respiratory viruses\nSARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nNote. Nearly all cases of acute bronchitis have a viral origin. Only in a very small proportion of cases, are atypical \npathogens ( Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Chlamydia pneumoniae ) involved. Atypical bacteria are intracellular and are \ncolourless with Gram staining. They also have intrinsic resistance to beta-lactams either because they lack a cell \nwall ( Mycoplasma ) and / or are intracellular pathogens ( Chlamydia ).\nClinical presentation\nWell-established clinical features of acute bronchitis include acute onset (less than 2 weeks) \nof cough lasting > 5 days with or without sputum production (of note yellow/green sputum The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 33PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n4. Bronchitis\ndoes not indicate a bacterial infection). Bronchitis is generally a mild condition with no \ntachycardia (i.e. no increased heart rate) or tachypnoea (i.e. no increased respiratory rate) \nand in most cases of acute bronchitis there is no fever. Cough usually persists for 10-20 days \n(around 1\u20133 weeks) but it can last longer.\nBecause the predominant symptoms are cough with or without fever, these \nsymptoms can overlap with the clinical picture of pneumonia. As a result, patients can be \nincorrectly diagnosed as having pneumonia in the initial assessment and are often therefore \ninappropriately treated with antibiotics. This misdiagnosis can be avoided with careful \npatient assessment to clearly differentiate the two infections.\nUsually, patients with pneumonia:\n\u2022 are clinically unwell and with systemic signs of infection (e.g. fever, increased \nheart rate, increased respiratory rate or focal chest signs),\n\u2022 are short of breath,\n\u2022 have cough with sputum production. \nPlease refer to the chapter on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) for the typical \nclinical presentation of patients with pneumonia.\nIn patients with pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), please \nrefer to the chapter on this condition.\nLaboratory tests\nPatient microbiology tests\nNo microbiology test is usually required.\nDuring the influenza season or in case of outbreaks, a nasopharyngeal swab to test \nfor influenza could be considered. Local policies should be followed as to whether during the \ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic a nasopharyngeal swab or other sample (e.g. \npharyngeal swab or saliva) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) \ntesting (nucleic acid amplification test or rapid antigen test) should be obtained. Refer to the \nlatest WHO guidelines for the management of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nOther tests\nIn the great majority of cases of bronchitis, laboratory tests are not needed.\nIn uncertain cases some experts advocate the use of biomarkers of infection \n(C-reactive protein, procalcitonin) to differentiate viral bronchitis from bacterial pneumonia, \nbut these add costs and can also result in inappropriate prescribing due to the limited \nsensitivity and specificity of these tests.34 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n4. Bronchitis\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nAs antibiotics are not recommended no routine microbiology surveillance is required. \nSurveillance of circulating respiratory viruses can be useful to predict and follow \nepidemics and outbreaks, for example, SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus and respiratory \nsyncytial virus.\nImaging\nImaging is usually not needed.\nNo antibiotic care \nPatients or parents should be informed about the natural course of acute bronchitis. It \nshould be explained that the cough can persist for several weeks, often at night, the great \nmajority of cases are self-limiting (and of viral origin) and there is no benefit from a course \nof antibiotic treatment. For symptomatic care for cold or mild influenza symptoms refer to \nTable 4.2. There is no clear evidence to support the usefulness of bronchodilators (in case of \nwheezing), or mucolytic or antitussive agents, but their use could be considered based on \nlocal practices and patient preferences.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 35PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n4.

Acute otitis media \nPathophysiology\nPathogens that infect the middle ear come from the nasopharynx through the Eustachian \ntube usually following a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. Inflammation and \noedema cause narrowing of the tube and accumulation of mucosal secretions which \nfavours growth of pathogens in the middle ear. This sequence of events triggers the typical \nsigns and symptoms of otitis media.\nEpidemiology \nAcute otitis media is very common in young children under 5 years of age with most \nexperiencing at least one episode before the age of 3 years. Acute otitis media can complicate \nupper respiratory tract infections in up to a third of cases, especially in the first year of life (43). The \nestimated global incidence of acute otitis media in 2017 was 317 million cases, for all ages and \nboth sexes combined (44). Children are more at risk of acute otitis media because their Eustachian \ntubes are narrower than those of an adult, which results in impaired drainage of fluids away \nfrom the middle ear. The incidence declines with age and adults are rarely affected. In countries \nwhere vaccination programmes against pneumococcal infection have been implemented, the \nincidence of acute otitis media among children has declined substantially (45,46) . In low- and \nmiddle-income countries, acute otitis media is still an important cause of hearing loss in children \ndue to its progression into chronic suppurative otitis media when untreated (47).\nMost likely pathogens\nSeveral bacterial and/or viral respiratory pathogens are associated with acute otitis media \n(Table 5.1) (48). Most cases of otitis media are triggered by infections with respiratory \nviruses (respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus and coronavirus), which can be complicated \nby superinfection with bacteria.\nTable 5.1 \u2013 Pathogens most frequently associated with acute otitis media (in \ndescending order of frequency)\nRespiratory viruses (most cases) Bacteria (rarely)\nRespiratory syncytial virus \nRhinovirus \nCoronavirus (including SARS-CoV-2)\nInfluenza virus (A and B)\nOther respiratory virusesStreptococcus pneumoniae\nHaemophilus influenzae\nMoraxella catarrhalis\nStreptococcus pyogenes  (group A Streptococcus )\nSARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 41PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n5. Acute otitis media \nOtitis media caused by possible antibiotic-resistant \npathogens\nAmoxicillin has good activity against most isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae . Local \npatterns of susceptibility and individual risk factors should be considered when evaluating \nthe possibility of an infection caused by isolates likely to be resistant to amoxicillin. Resistance \nis more likely in the case of recent exposure to amoxicillin (less than 3 months) or recurrent \nepisodes (more than four episodes a year) of acute otitis media. Higher doses of amoxicillin \nare still active against most resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae  and this antibiotic \nremains the treatment of choice. \nClinical presentation\nTypical signs and symptoms of acute otitis media include recent onset of ear pain (unilateral \nor bilateral), fever (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C) and at times, ear discharge.\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nIn uncomplicated cases, microbiological tests are usually not needed and cultures of pus \nfrom perforated ear drums should not be used to guide treatment. \nOther tests\nWhen acute otitis media is suspected clinically, blood tests are usually not needed (except \nin situations where complications such as mastoiditis are suspected).\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nThere is no role for routine surveillance for resistant pathogens. \nOtoscopy\nOtoscopy is required for a definitive diagnosis of acute otitis media. However, otoscopy or \nhealth care personnel with otoscopy skills may not be available in all settings.\nIn settings where otoscopy is available, classic findings include bulging, inflamed/congested \ntympanic membrane that may be opaque and show decreased mobility (Figure 5.1).42 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n5. Acute otitis media \nFigure 5.1 \u2013 Image of inflamed/congested tympanic membrane in otitis media\nSource: \u00a9 B. Welleschik, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons.\nImaging\nIn uncomplicated cases, no imaging study is needed. If available, imaging (e.g. computed \ntomography (CT) scan) may be indicated only in situations where complications such as \nmastoiditis are suspected.\nNo antibiotic care\nMost non-severe cases of acute otitis media can be managed symptomatically and do not \nrequire antibiotic treatment, especially in children older than 2 years. \nNon-severe cases usually have mild symptoms, often pain in one ear, and mild \nfever (< 39.0 \u00b0C), which improves with antipyretics. A watchful waiting approach with \nsymptomatic management (i.e. analgesics and antipyretics) is appropriate (Table 5.2). \nWatchful waiting involves careful monitoring of the child by caregivers, with instructions to \nseek care in case of worsening of fever, pain or persistence of the symptoms.\nThe great majority of cases usually resolve spontaneously over a few days with no \nneed for antibiotic treatment and the risk of complications (e.g. acute mastoiditis) is very \nlow. Reassessment could be considered if symptoms do not improve over 3 days.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 43PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n5.

Pharyngitis\nPathophysiology\nViruses and bacteria responsible for pharyngitis gain access to the mucosal cells of the \npharynx through different mechanisms and start replicating in these cells. Damage is \ncaused to the cells where pathogens are replicating.\nEpidemiology \nSore throat is one of the most common conditions in patients presenting to primary health \ncare and remains a very frequent cause of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. Up to 60% of \npatients with sore throat are given antibiotics in many high-income outpatient settings (55,56) .\nIncidence and prevalence data on sore throat are unavailable for most low- and \nmiddle-income country settings. Most cases of pharyngitis are self-limiting and of viral \norigin. Cases of sore throat caused by bacteria (mostly Streptococcus pyogenes ) are rare and \nwere responsible for about 10% of cases among patients with sore throat of all ages in a \nmeta-analysis, but severe complications can occur (57). These complications are either due \nto invasion of the organism in the pharynx (e.g. suppurative complications such as quinsy) \nor to an abnormal immunological response (e.g. acute rheumatic fever) (58,59) . Suppurative \ncomplications occur in a very small number of cases, are difficult to predict and most can be \nreadily treated (60,61) . For this reason, the prevention of suppurative complications should \nnot be considered an indication for antibiotic treatment in sore throat.\nRheumatic fever is also a rare complication due to an autoimmune inflammatory \nreaction to untreated streptococcal pharyngitis; usually less than 3% of untreated cases of \npharyngitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes  trigger rheumatic fever in settings where this \ncondition is endemic (53,62) . The incidence of rheumatic fever peaks between 5 and 15 \nyears of age and is rare in people older than 30 years. \nWhen rheumatic fever develops, it usually presents (70\u201375% of cases) as an acute \nfebrile illness with joint manifestations (e.g. pain or tenderness) and carditis. Less frequently, \nrheumatic fever can present as a predominantly neurological and/or behavioural disorder. \nSymptoms usually develop 2\u20133 weeks after the initial symptoms of pharyngitis are evident. \nUltimately, rheumatic fever can result in damage to the heart valves (rheumatic heart \ndisease). About 60% of people with rheumatic fever will develop rheumatic heart disease \nand the risk is two times higher for females than males.\nDespite the lack of data from many countries, 30 million people worldwide are thought \nto be affected by rheumatic heart disease, with an estimated 320 000 deaths in 2015 (63).\nCases of rheumatic fever are concentrated in the WHO African, South-East Asian and \nWestern Pacific regions; these regions account for about 84% of cases. With 27% of all cases \nof rheumatic fever in 2015 India has the highest burden worldwide (53). 52 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n6. Pharyngitis\nMost likely pathogens\nMost (> 80%) cases of pharyngitis are caused by a viral infection (respiratory viruses have \nbeen identified in 25\u201345% of cases; less frequently, the Epstein\u2013Barr virus or other viruses \nof the herpesvirus family or SARS-CoV-2 are the cause). A minority of cases of pharyngitis \nare caused by bacteria, mainly Streptococcus pyogenes  (group A Streptococcus ). Other \nstreptococci (group C and G) have also been implicated as causes of pharyngitis (Table 6.1). \nOther infectious causes that need to be considered are acute human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV) infection and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as syphilis and \ngonorrhoea, acute toxoplasmosis and diphtheria \u2013 consider diphtheria if fever and greyish-\nwhite membranes covering the tonsil(s) are present in a child not vaccinated against \ndiphtheria. Rarely, the cause of pharyngitis is non-infectious, for example, exposure to \npollution, allergens and smoking.\nTable 6.1 \u2013 Pathogens most frequently associated with pharyngitis (in descending \norder of frequency)\nViruses (most cases) Bacteria (rarely)\nRespiratory syncytial virus \nRhinovirus \nCoronavirus (including SARS-CoV-2)\nInfluenza virus (A and B)\nOther respiratory viruses\nOther viruses (rarely)\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus\nHIVStreptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus )\nGroup C Streptococcus\nGroup G Streptococcus\nTreponema pallidum\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae\nHIV: human immunodeficiency virus; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nPharyngitis caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens\nStreptococcus pyogenes  is still universally very susceptible to penicillin. Resistance to \npenicillin has never been reported and there is no evidence of increasing minimal inhibitory \nconcentrations. However, resistance to macrolides is common in some settings. \nClinical presentation\nPharyngitis is characterized by sore throat and painful swallowing. Typical accompanying \nsigns and symptoms can vary depending on the etiology. If the cause is viral, symptoms  The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 53PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n6. Pharyngitis\nmatch those of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, and cough, headache and myalgia \nare likely to be present. If the cause is bacterial, a more severe presentation is usually seen, \nwith fever (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C), tender cervical lymph nodes and pharyngeal exudates. Several \nclinical scoring systems have been developed to identify patients with higher likelihood of \npharyngitis being caused by Streptococcus pyogenes  (see the next section).\nScoring symptoms of pharyngitis\nThe specific cause of pharyngitis may be difficult to recognize based on symptoms alone. \nScoring systems can help differentiate a viral infection from one of bacterial origin. The \nrationale is to help health care workers standardize the therapeutic approach and decide \nwhether antibiotic treatment could be given based on the most likely etiology. However, \nscoring systems have a low specificity (i.e. high risk of incorrectly identifying patients with \nviral pharyngitis as having a Streptococcus pyogenes  infection) and can lead to unnecessary \nantibiotic treatment. Moreover, most systems have only been validated in high-income \nsettings. \nOne of the most widely used systems in the adult population is the Centor clinical \nscoring system (Table 6.2). However, even with the highest score of 4, the probability of an \ninfection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes  is only 50% (64).\nIn low- and middle-income countries, other scores could be considered that have \nbeen specifically validated in these settings (65).\nTable 6.2 \u2013 Centor score for the clinical assessment of pharyngitis\nRelevant signs and symptoms Points\nFever > 38.0 \u00b0C 1\nNo cough 1\nTender anterior cervical lymphadenitis 1\nTonsillar exudates 1\nTotal score Likelihood of Streptococcus pyogenes  infection (%)\n0 1\u20132.5\n1 5\u201310\n2 11\u201317\n3 28\u201335\ncontinues54 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n6.

In many settings no tests are routinely \navailable. The rationale for identifying cases caused by Streptococcus pyogenes  is that those \nare the cases that may benefit the most from antibiotic treatment in certain settings (mostly \nto prevent rheumatic fever). In general, most guidelines prefer rapid antigen tests to cultures \nbecause they give results more quickly. Table 6.3 summarizes the microbiology tests that \ncould be considered to diagnose pharyngitis.\nTable 6.3 \u2013 Microbiology tests that could be considered if available for the \ndiagnosis of pharyngitis as indicated in the WHO EDL (6)\nDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Settings where the test \nshould be available\nGroup A \nStreptococcus  \nantigena (RDT)To aid in the diagnosis of Group A \nstreptococcal pharyngitisCommunity settings and health \nfacilities without laboratoriesb\ncontinuesThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 55PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n6.

These tests are also assumed to be available at health care facilities with laboratories.\nIn the case of a low likelihood of Streptococcus pyogenes  as the causative pathogen \n(i.e. a Centor score of 0 to 2; see Table 6.2), rapid antigen test or throat culture are not usually \nneeded.\nIn the case of a higher likelihood of Streptococcus pyogenes  as the causative \npathogen (i.e. Centor score 3\u20134), rapid antigen test or throat culture could be considered, \nespecially in countries where rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease are important \nproblems. (Note: WHO recommends the use of a rapid antigen test as part of the strategy \nfor primary prevention of rheumatic fever through the effective treatment of streptococcal \npharyngitis (53)). \nIn children and adolescents with a Centor score of 3 or 4, a negative rapid antigen \ntest could be confirmed with a throat culture if available.\nOther tests\nWhen pharyngitis is suspected, blood tests are not usually needed unless a complication is \nthought to be present.\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nAs amoxicillin or penicillin are the recommended first line treatment and Streptococcus \npyogenes  is still universally very susceptible to these antibiotics, there is no role for routine \nsurveillance to inform empiric guidance.\nImaging\nWhen pharyngitis is thought to be the cause of clinical symptoms, imaging is usually not \nrequired unless a complication is suspected.56 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n6. Pharyngitis\nNo antibiotic care\nMost cases of pharyngitis are of viral origin and do not benefit from antibiotics. In most \ncases, including those of bacterial origin, symptoms resolve within a week.

Pharyngitis\nAntibiotic treatment \nMost cases of pharyngitis are of viral origin and do not benefit from antibiotics .\nWhen bacterial pharyngitis is suspected or proven, the decision to give antibiotic \ntreatment is usually based on the likelihood of Streptococcus pyogenes  infection and on \nthe local prevalence or patient history of rheumatic fever. Options to consider are given in \nTable 6.5. Second choice options reported in Table 6.5 should only be considered in patients \nallergic to first-choice options. In the case of clarithromycin, the prevalence of macrolide \nresistance in the setting where the patient acquired the infection should be considered \nsince macrolide resistance among Streptococcus pyogenes  is high is certain countries.\nIn general, patients will fall into one of the following two categories.\n\u2022 Patients treated in settings with a low prevalence of rheumatic fever. Antibiotic \ntreatment is not needed in most cases . Antibiotics could be considered in \nsome patients who have a high likelihood of pharyngitis caused by Streptococcus \npyogenes  (i.e. Centor score 3\u20134). However, even with a Centor score of 3 or 4, \nantibiotic treatment is not necessary in most cases. Antibiotic treatment reduces \nsore throat pain only by around 1 day and the pain can alternatively be managed \nby regular analgesia.\n Antibiotic treatment could be discussed with patients or their caregivers on a \ncase-by-case basis, weighing the benefits (e.g. reduced transmission and slight \nreduction in duration of symptoms) and risks (e.g. side-effects of antibiotics, \neffect on the intestinal microbiota) (66). Relief of symptoms or prevention of \nsuppurative complications is not considered an indication for antibiotic treatment. \nThe rationale is that most suppurative complications are not severe and can be \nreadily recognized and treated. \n\u2022 Patients treated in settings with a medium to high prevalence of rheumatic fever \nand rheumatic heart disease or patients with a history of rheumatic fever or \nrheumatic heart disease. Antibiotic treatment is usually given if the likelihood of \nStreptococcus pyogenes  pharyngitis is high (i.e. Centor score 3\u20134). The rationale is \nto prevent rheumatic fever or its recurrence.

Acute sinusitis\nPathophysiology\nNasal congestion, usually triggered by an infection of the upper respiratory tract, can lead to \nobstruction of the sinus ostia with consequent hypoxia of the sinuses and mucus retention. \nMostly the maxillary and the anterior ethmoid sinuses are involved. The inflammatory \nresponse that develops produces the signs and symptoms of acute sinusitis.\nEpidemiology \nUpper respiratory tract infections are a common reason for consultations in an outpatient \nsetting, both for children and adults. According to the 2017 Global Burden of Disease \nstudy, upper respiratory tract infections are one of the top three causes of new disease \nglobally for all ages and both sexes combined \u2013 an estimated 17.1 billion cases are \nrecorded a year (44). Acute sinusitis accounts for 0.5% of all upper respiratory tract \ninfections and is much more common in adults than in children whose sinuses are not \nfully developed. \nMost available data are from high-income settings and show that antibiotics are frequently \nprescribed in cases of acute viral sinusitis (7,41) .\nMost likely pathogens\nAcute sinusitis is usually caused by respiratory viruses; only a small percentage (usually less \nthan 2%) of cases are complicated by bacterial infection (Table 7.1).\nTable 7.1 \u2013 Pathogens most frequently associated with acute sinusitis (in \ndescending order of frequency)\nRespiratory viruses (most cases)aBacteria\nInfluenza virus (A and B)\nRespiratory syncytial virus\nParainfluenza virus\nRhinovirus\nCoronavirus (including SARS-CoV-2)\nOther respiratory virusesRarely\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\nHaemophilus influenzae\nVery rarely\nMoraxella catarrhalis\nStreptococcus pyogenes  (group A Streptococcus )\nStaphylococcus aureus\nSARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\na About 98% of cases are caused by respiratory viruses.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 67PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n7. Acute sinusitis\nSinusitis caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens\nAmoxicillin has good clinical activity against the great majority of isolates of Streptococcus \npneumoniae . However, since the introduction of anti-pneumococcal vaccines, there is \nconcern about increasing incidence of acute sinusitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae  \nand Moraxella catarrhalis  and an increased incidence of beta-lactamase production among \nthese strains that may result in amoxicillin resistance. Higher doses of amoxicillin are still \nactive against most resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae  and this antibiotic remains \nthe treatment of choice. \nLocal patterns of susceptibility and individual risk factors should be considered when \nevaluating the possibility of an infection caused by isolates likely to be resistant to amoxicillin.\nClinical presentation\nThe diagnosis of sinusitis is made based on clinical criteria and the time pattern; it is \nimportant to consider that symptoms of acute bacterial sinusitis and acute viral sinusitis \noverlap considerably. Symptoms usually last for 10\u201314 days and are self-limiting. \nThe main symptoms of acute sinusitis are purulent nasal drainage, nasal obstruction \nor congestion, unilateral dental or facial pain, and facial fullness or pressure. Cough may also \nbe present.\nThe location of pain in sinusitis depends on which sinuses are affected. For example, \npain can be localized on the forehead (frontal sinuses), over cheekbones/teeth/upper jaw \n(maxillary sinuses) or behind the nose (ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses).\nAcute bacterial sinusitis should be suspected in two situations:\n\u2022 signs and symptoms persist without improvement for more than 10 days\n\u2022 symptoms become significantly worse after an initial mild phase.\nYellow/green colour of nasal discharge alone is not a sign of bacterial infection and \nis not an indication for antibiotic treatment.\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nWhen sinusitis is suspected clinically, nasal cultures or nucleic acid tests for respiratory \nviruses are not usually needed. 68 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n7. Acute sinusitis\nOther tests\nWhen sinusitis is suspected clinically, blood tests are usually not needed.\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nAs the great majority of cases have no positive bacterial cultures, there is no role for routine \nsurveillance to inform empiric guidance.\nImaging\nWhen sinusitis is suspected clinically, imaging is not usually needed unless a complication \nor an alternative diagnosis is suspected.\nNo antibiotic care\nThe goal of treatment is to improve symptoms. Antibiotics have only minimal effect on \nthe duration of symptoms in most cases and current evidence suggests that even without \nantibiotic treatment, most cases in healthy patients resolve within 1\u20132 weeks (69). \nMost guidelines recommend using disease severity (i.e. duration and intensity of \nsymptoms) to direct treatment.\nIn case of mild to moderate presentation (less than 10 days duration and improving \nsymptoms), a watchful waiting approach with symptom relief and no antibiotic treatment is \nusually adequate. Symptoms should be managed with antipyretic and analgesic medications \n(Table 7.2). Nasal irrigation with a saline solution and topical intranasal glucocorticoids or \ndecongestants may also be used to relieve symptoms, even though their effectiveness in \nrelieving symptom is still uncertain (70). \nThe rationale of a watchful waiting approach is that in uncomplicated cases in \nadults, antibiotics (compared to no treatment) can shorten the duration of symptoms and \nimprove the course of infection (e.g. resolution of purulent nasal discharge) only in a small \npercentage of patients. However, these potential benefits must be balanced against the risk \nof adverse events from antibiotics (e.g. gastrointestinal side-effects, allergic reaction and \nrash) and of increasing bacterial resistance (69).The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 69PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n7.

Abscesses can be categorized as: \n\u2022 apical abscess, when the infection at the apex of the dental root originates from \nwithin the dental pulp. This is the most common form of dental abscess and \nusually results from untreated dental caries. \n\u2022 periodontal abscess, where there is a collection of pus between the root and \nalveolar bone usually resulting from serious gum diseases. \nAlveolar bone:  part of the jawbones which surrounds and supports the teeth.\nApical periodontitis:  inflammation (associated with pain) within the alveolar bone around \nthe apex of a tooth, often occurring as a consequence of a necrotic pulp following pulpitis, \ntooth fracture or trauma.\nDental caries:  tooth decay.\nDental pulp:  blood vessels and nerves within the inner part of the tooth.\nDry socket (alveolar osteitis):  a recognized inflammatory complication of tooth extraction \nwhich may develop a few days after extraction, last for more than a week and is extremely \npainful.\nGingivae (gums):  soft tissue covering the alveolar bone.\nNecrotic pulp:  An irreversible condition that occurs when the pulp within the tooth \nbecomes non-vital (dies) and is often associated with apical periodontitis.\nNoma (cancrum oris/gangrenous stomatitis):  an acute necrotizing disease that \ndestroys the soft tissues and bones of the mouth and face as it progresses from necrotizing \nperiodontal disease (previously known as necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis), mostly in \nmalnourished children living in extreme poverty and with weakened immune systems.\nPericoronitis:  inflammation of the gingiva (gum) surrounding a partially erupted tooth, \noften a lower wisdom tooth, which may be associated with an infection.\nPeriodontal disease:  a group of inflammatory diseases affecting the tissues that surround \nand support the teeth. This includes:\n\u2022 Gingivitis:  inflammation of the gingivae (gums).\n\u2022 Periodontitis:  chronic inflammatory disease of bacterial etiology that affects the \nsoft and hard tissues which support the tooth, including alveolar bone.\n\u2022 Necrotizing periodontal disease (previously known as necrotizing \nulcerative gingivitis):  a severe gum infection characterized by necrosis and \nulcerations caused by a bacterial infection and often accompanied by severe pain \nand a strongly unpleasant smell.74 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n8. Oral and dental infections \nPlaque:  biofilm of microbes, mainly bacteria, which grows on surfaces within the mouth \nand contributes to oral diseases such as caries and periodontal disease.\nPulpitis: inflammation of the dental pulp causing pain. This condition often occurs as a \nresult of the progression of dental caries and can lead to apical periodontitis which can then \nevolve into a dental abscess.\nSpreading infection:  development of sepsis or the spread of infection through the fascial \nspaces to vital structures of the head and neck (such as cellulitis) which can occur rapidly \nand become life-threatening.\nFigure 8.1 \u2013 Anatomy of a healthy tooth\nCrown\nRootEname l\nDentin\nPulp\nGum /uni0028.caseG ingiva)\nBone\nHealth y To othCementNeckThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book75\nPRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n8.

Oral and dental infections \nPathophysiology\nMost dental conditions relate to the oral microbiota in dental plaque and do not require \nantibiotic treatment. Dental plaque is a microbe rich biofilm that sticks to surfaces within the \nmouth, including teeth, dentures and orthodontic appliances. In the presence of free sugars, \nespecially sucrose from the diet, plaque bacteria can create an environment that favours \ntooth decay (dental caries). Acid produced by plaque bacteria in the presence of sugar causes \nthis destruction, which is reversible only when confined to the outer enamel layer. Unless it is \nremoved, the progression of caries is hard to stop once it enters the deeper parts of the tooth.\nIf dental caries progresses to reach the pulp, inflammatory pain (pulpitis) occurs \nwhich can eventually lead to pulpal necrosis and the tooth becoming non-vital. When this \noccurs, a tooth may initially be pain free or become tender to touch (apical periodontitis). If \nleft to progress further, a localized accumulation of pus (periapical abscess) may form or an \ninfection of the tooth, gums or alveolar bone supporting the tooth may spread to adjacent \nvital structures in the head and neck (e.g. cellulitis) or through the bloodstream (e.g. sepsis). \nAccumulation of dental plaque around the gingival margin of teeth (at the gumline) \nand in periodontal pockets (below the gumline) can stimulate an inflammatory response. In \nsome people this can lead to immune-mediated destruction of the periodontal structures \n(e.g. gums or alveolar bone) which support the teeth. Progressive destruction of these \nperiodontal tissues may lead to teeth becoming mobile and eventually to tooth loss. \nSome protective mechanisms to reduce plaque accumulation include saliva and the \ncleansing action of the tongue. Regular removal of plaque through oral hygiene practices, \nsuch as toothbrushing and interdental cleaning, is essential to prevent and manage dental \ncaries and periodontal disease. \nEpidemiology\nDespite being largely preventable, oral disease (including dental caries and periodontal \ndisease) is common and an important public health problem (78).\nUntreated dental caries affect almost half of the world\u2019s population (42% in 2015) \nmaking it the most prevalent of the oral conditions reported in the Global Burden of Disease \nStudy (78). \nThe prevalence of untreated caries in permanent teeth was highest in young people \naged 15\u201319 years. Periodontal disease is less common than dental caries, with an overall \nyearly prevalence of around 7%. As periodontal disease may progress through life, it is \nhighest in older people aged 55\u201359 years (78).\nCommon risk factors for dental infections include diets high in free sugars and poor \noral hygiene leading to dental caries. Poor oral hygiene, smoking or chewing tobacco, stress, \nmalnutrition and being immunocompromised are risk factors for periodontal diseases,  82 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n8. Oral and dental infections \nincluding necrotizing periodontal disease (previously known as necrotizing ulcerative \ngingivitis). Poor oral hygiene and severe malnutrition are also risk factors for noma, a \nnecrotizing disease most commonly seen in children living in low-income countries and \nwith a 90% fatality rate if left untreated.\nMost likely pathogens\nThe normal oral microbiota is richly diverse, including both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, \ntogether with fungi, especially Candida  spp.. Most dental infections are caused by conditions in \nthe oral environment which favour the growth of pathogens. For example, an abundance of free \nsugars, such as sucrose, favours cariogenic bacteria (e.g. Streptococcus mutans ) resulting in tooth \ndecay. Reduced saliva flow makes patients with a dry mouth at increased risk of dental caries \nas there is less natural protection from the saliva. Furthermore, a recent course of antibiotics is \na common cause for oral candidiasis (thrush). While the precise composition of an individual\u2019s \noral microbiota will differ between parts of the mouth and will change over time and between \nindividuals, Table 8.1 shows a typical mix of the bacteria that are part of the oral microbiota in \nhealth and disease. The oral microbiota and associated disease can be significantly different \ndepending on the precise location. For example, enamel caries is more often associated with \nStreptococcus mutans  whereas Actinomyces  spp. predominate in root caries.\nTable 8.1 \u2013 Normal resident oral microbiota and pathogens most frequently \nassociated with dental infections (in descending order of frequency)\nNormal resident oral \nmicrobiotaaBacteria associated with \ncariesbBacteria associated with \nperiodontal disease\nStreptococcus  spp.\nActinomyces  spp.\nPrevotella  spp.\nVeillonella  spp.Streptococcus  spp. (e.g. \nStreptococcus mutans )\nLactobacillus  spp.\nActinomyces  spp.Anaerobes (most cases), e.g.:\nPrevotella  spp.\nCapnocytophaga  spp.\nAggregatibacter  spp.\nPorphyromonas  spp.\na A richly diverse group of pathogens, including both aerobic bacteria and anaerobes.\nb Mostly acidogenic bacteria\nClinical presentation \nTypical signs and symptoms of selected oral conditions are described in the following \ntwo sections. Dental pain is often due to inflammation rather than infection and careful \ndiagnosis is required to ensure optimal treatment is provided and antibiotic use minimized.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 83PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n8. Oral and dental infections \nThe severity of signs and symptoms may range from mild diseases (most cases) \nthat can be safely managed in an outpatient setting to severe infections of dental origin \n(including sepsis) that require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotic treatment. Oral \nand dental infections commonly involve the lymph nodes and can also spread through \nthe fascial spaces of the head and neck to block the airway, move into the brain through \nthe periorbital area and can present as osteomyelitis. Please refer to the chapters on sepsis, \nlymphadenitis and osteomyelitis if these sequelae are suspected.\nConditions that may require antibiotic treatment\nAbscess\nAn apical abscess (Figure 8.2) is the most common type of dental abscess. It is often, but not \nalways, painful and characterized by persistent localized pain that can radiate to the ear, jaw \nand neck. Tooth tenderness (stimulated by chewing or food trapping) is common as well as \nswelling of the soft tissues adjacent to the affected tooth. \nIf an apical abscess is left untreated, there is a high risk of spread to vital structures \nof the head and neck or systemic spread of the infection that can then lead to sepsis. Signs \nthat the infection has spread include cellulitis around the eye or throat (causing difficulties \nswallowing or breathing, e.g. Ludwig angina), fever (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C), malaise, tachycardia \n(increased heart rate) and lymphadenopathy. This must be treated as a medical emergency.\nA periodontal abscess (Figure 8.2) is less common than an apical abscess. It \nis usually a localized accumulation of pus in the periodontal tissues (gums and alveolar \nbone supporting the tooth) which can be readily drained by professional cleaning of the \nperiodontal pocket or by extraction of the tooth without the need for antibiotics.\nFigure 8.2 \u2013 Periapical and periodontal abscess\nPeriapical Abscess\nPeriapical Absces\n sNecr otic pulp\nPeriapica l\nabscess\nPeriodon tal AbscessPeriodonta l\nabcess84 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n8.

It usually occurs in late adolescence and early \nadult life and can be treated by professional cleaning, saline (hot salty water) mouthwash \nand, if necessary, by draining the infection. Antibiotics are not normally required, although \nif infection is present, it should be carefully monitored as it can spread rapidly causing \ndifficulty opening the mouth, swallowing or breathing. Cellulitis of the neck (e.g. Ludwig \nangina) is a medical emergency as it can quickly become life-threatening.\nFigure 8.3 \u2013 Pericoronitis\nPericor onitisInflamed gu m\nNecrotizing periodontal disease\nNecrotizing periodontal disease (Figure 8.4), which was previously known as necrotizing \nulcerative gingivitis, is characterized by the following: severe pain and inflamed ulcerated \ngums that bleed easily; necrosis of the interdental papillae; foul breath; and a bad taste in \nthe mouth. It may also be accompanied by systemic symptoms, such as fever \u2265 38.0 \u00b0C, \nmalaise and lymphadenopathy.\nFigure 8.4 \u2013 Necrotizing periodontal disease\nNecr otizing Periodontal DiseaseNecrotic gu mThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 85PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n8. Oral and dental infections \nNoma\nNoma is a necrotizing disease that destroys the mouth and face. It begins as necrotizing \nperiodontal disease that progresses rapidly, destroying the soft tissues and bones of \nthe mouth and further progressing to perforate the hard tissues and skin of the face. \nIt mostly affects young children between the ages of 2 and 6 years suffering from \nsevere malnutrition, living in extreme poverty and with weakened immune systems. Its \nprevalence is highest in sub-Saharan Africa. Noma is fatal for 90% of the children affected. \nIf detected early, its progression can be rapidly halted, through basic oral hygiene rules, \ndiet supplementation with proteins and nutrients and with antibiotics. Early detection \nhelps to prevent suffering, disability and death. Please also refer to the WHO information \nbrochure for early detection and management of noma for more information about this \ntopic (77).\nConditions that do not require antibiotic treatment\nDental caries progression to pulpal disease\nDental caries is the localized destruction of dental hard tissue (enamel or dentine) by acid-\nproducing plaque bacteria in the presence of dietary sugar. This process can be reversible in \nearly lesions. Caries can sometimes lead to the formation of cavities (i.e. holes in the tooth) \nwhich are often hidden in the space between the teeth. Diagnosis is based on response of \nthe tooth to cold/hot stimulus and radiographic imaging. Cavities and devitalized teeth may \nappear dark in colour compared to other teeth.\nCaries develops slowly and can be pain free in the initial phase. However, if left \nuntreated, the lesion can extend to the dental pulp causing pulpitis to begin with, then \npulpal necrosis and ultimately dental abscess. Severe disease or necrosis of the dental pulp \nas a consequence of dental caries can be associated with systemic infections.\nReversible pulpitis is characterized by acute pain or discomfort initially caused by \ndrinking hot or cold beverages. It is possible to treat the problem at this stage with a simple \nrestoration.\nIf caries progresses, irreversible pulpitis (Figure 8.5) develops causing constant \nsevere pain which characteristically keeps the patient awake at night. This pain may stop \nsuddenly when progression of the disease leads to necrosis of the dental pulp.\nIf left untreated, apical periodontitis (Figure 8.5) often develops, characterized by \ndull throbbing in the surrounding area (mouth and jaw) and soreness while biting. The pain \nmay be eased by cold and made worse by heat (e.g. hot and cold beverages). Progression \nof the condition may lead to an apical abscess, and this is the most common cause of \ndental abscess.86 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n8.

It \noccurs 2\u20133 days after extraction and can last for up to 10 days. Severe pain develops a few days \nafter the dental procedure, associated with slow healing of the socket; it may be accompanied \nby an unpleasant taste. Appropriate pain control is necessary as pain may last for many \ndays. Antibiotics are not appropriate for the prophylaxis or treatment of dry socket unless \nosteomyelitis is suspected; please refer to the chapter on osteomyelitis if this is suspected. \nPeriodontal disease \nPeriodontal disease (Figure 8.6) is the term used to describe a range of conditions affecting \nthe tissues that surround and support the teeth, including gingivitis and periodontitis. As \nthese are generally immune-mediated diseases, it is usually inappropriate to use antibiotics \nfor their treatment.\nFigure 8.6 \u2013 Periodontal disease\nPeriodontal Diseas e\nPeriodontitis\n(Bone loss)Gingivitis\n(Inflamed gum)The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 87PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n8. Oral and dental infections \nGingivitis\nGingivitis is characterized by redness and swelling of the gums due to the build up of food \ndebris and microbial biofilm. It is usually painless, but bleeding when toothbrushing is \ncommon. Halitosis may be present. In its early stages, gingivitis is reversible with good oral \nhygiene. Severe forms of gingivitis are known but are rare. \nPeriodontitis\nPeriodontitis is an inflammatory disease characterized by the progressive destruction of the \nalveolar bone which supports the teeth. It is often a hidden disease as it is generally painless \nand progresses below the gums. Halitosis may be present. In case of periapical periodontitis, \nsoreness, while biting can occur due to a devitalized (dead) tooth.\nThe disease process of periodontitis occurs over time (usually years) and people \noften only become aware of it when their teeth start to move or fall out; a more aggressive \ndestruction of the bone may sometimes be seen. Oral health professionals use special \nprobes when carrying out periodontal screening to enable early diagnosis and treatment of \nperiodontitis. Addressing risk factors, including effective cleaning of the periodontal tissues \n(under the gums), smoking cessation and good diabetes control are essential. Antibiotics \nare only appropriate for the treatment of aggressively destructive conditions; antibiotics are \nnot appropriate for chronic periodontitis.\nLaboratory tests\nPatient microbiology tests\nRoutine microbiology tests are not required in most cases of dental infection but can be \nconsidered in severe cases requiring hospitalization, when culture and sensitivity testing \n(e.g. blood and/or pus aspirates for culture) can help in the selection of an appropriate \nantibiotic, for example, if cellulitis (e.g. Ludwig angina) is spreading to vital structures or if \nsepsis is suspected. Please also refer to the chapter on sepsis, if suspected.\nOther tests\nMost dental infections are bacterial, except for oral thrush (a fungal infection usually caused \nby Candida  spp.) and cold sores (a viral infection) which are easily recognizable clinically.\nAcute dental conditions are routinely diagnosed using point-of-care tests and \ninvestigations (see point-of-care tests and investigations in the following section).\nRoutine laboratory tests are not required in most cases of dental infections but may \nbe considered in severe cases requiring hospitalization. 88 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n8. Oral and dental infections \nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nRoutine microbiology surveillance of oral microbiota does not generally take place, so such \ndata are unavailable for clinical guidance. \nPoint-of-care tests and investigations to assist \ndiagnosis\nEstablishing the source of the dental pain/infection is an important element of accurate \ndiagnosis and is essential to make appropriate treatment decisions. Sensitivity of the tooth \nto a cold stimulus indicates a vital pulp; depending on the intensity and duration of the \nstimulated pain, this may indicate pulpitis. \nNo response to cold may indicate a non-vital/necrotic pulp and tenderness to \npercussion (tapping the tooth) indicates that the pain originates in the supporting bone \nand may be due to an abscess. Periodontal probing can identify a periodontal abscess if \npus exudes from a pocket greater than 3 mm or necrotizing ulcerative disease if there is \nextremely tender gingival tissue and grey sloughing.\nImaging\nIf a dental infection is suspected, imaging using dental radiographs (X-rays) should be done \nwherever possible as part of the diagnosis. Radiographs are important for differentiating \nbetween the various causes of dental pain, including how far caries (decay) has progressed \nand where tenderness to percussion is associated with a radiolucency (i.e. black area on \nradiographic image) in the alveolar bone suggesting an abscess. Location of the radiolucency \nrelative to the tooth helps differentiate between an apical or periodontal abscess.\nTreatment \nDental bacterial infections are rarely self-limiting and may rapidly become life-threatening if \nleft untreated. Most dental infection and pain are amenable to treatment by removal of the \ncause and drainage of the infection using a dental procedure, such as extraction of the tooth. \nRemoval of the cause of the infection using a dental procedure is usually the quickest and \nsafest way of resolving the problem, and is essential to avoid the risk of rapidly spreading and \npotentially life-threatening infection. Antibiotics are normally only required for the treatment \nof spreading infections.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 89PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n8. Oral and dental infections \nNo antibiotic care\nMost dental infections are characterized by some level of dental pain and, while adequate pain \ncontrol should always be offered, the prescription of medications alone is not usually appropriate.\nCaries, pulpal disease and dental abscesses are best treated with a dental procedure \nto remove the source of the problem; using painkillers alone is suboptimal as the condition \ncan progress to a life-threatening spreading infection. \nDry socket (alveolar osteitis) is an extremely painful and common occurrence \nfollowing dental extraction. It occurs 2\u20133 days after extraction and can last for up to 10 days. \nThis condition requires optimum pain management but no antibiotics are needed unless \nosteomyelitis is suspected; please refer to the chapter on osteomyelitis if this is suspected. \nIbuprofen and paracetamol are first choice painkillers for dental pain (Table 8.2). \nIn the case of severe pain, ibuprofen and paracetamol may work better when taken in \ncombination. \nCaution should be exercised as the incidence of paracetamol (acetaminophen) \noverdose in relation to dental pain is relatively high. Opioid painkillers should be avoided \nas they offer no benefit for this sort of pain and are associated with the risk of substance \nmisuse.\nTable 8.2 \u2013 Medicines to control acute dental pain\nImportant\nMedicines are listed in alphabetical order and they should all be considered equal treatment options.\nMedicine Formulation Dose and frequency\nIbuprofenaOral liquid: 200 mg/5 mL\nTablet: 200 mg; 400 mg; \n600 mgAdults : 200\u2013400 mg given every 6 to 8 \nhours (maximum dose of 2.4 g a day)\nChildren : \n\u2022 Pain control/antipyretic treatment: \n5\u201310 mg/kg given every 6 to 8 hours\n6\u2013< 10 kg: 50 mg given every 8 hours\n10\u2013< 15 kg: 100 mg given every 8 hours\n15\u2013< 20 kg: 150 mg given every 8 hours\n20\u2013< 30 kg: 200 mg given every 8 hours\n\u2265 30 kg: use adult dose\ncontinues90 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n8.

Warning: \noverdose is relatively common among people with severe dental pain.\nc In patients with hepatic impairment or cirrhosis, maximum daily dose should be 2 g.\nOral antiseptics \nRegular use of mouthwashes with an antiseptic product (e.g. chlorhexidine) is not required \nfor the control of dental infections. Such products could be considered in case of acute \nexacerbations of periodontal disease. Of note, no formulation of oral antiseptics is currently \nincluded in the EML and EMLc and rinsing with saline (salty water) is usually adequate as \nwell as being cheaper and more readily available. Caution should be exercised with the \nuse of chlorhexidine mouthwash in patients following extractions or treatment of alveolar \nosteitis (dry socket following dental extraction) as it has been associated with anaphylaxis. \nDental procedures\nDental procedures are usually the quickest and safest solutions for dental pain and infection.\nCommonly performed dental procedures are briefly described in Table 8.3.

Efforts should \nbe made to restrict the use of antibiotics only to situations when their use is strictly \nnecessary (79,80) .\nAntibiotic treatment is required only for few dental conditions . \nAntibiotics are not appropriate for inflammatory conditions (including periodontitis, \nirreversible pulpitis and dry socket treatment) because they do not prevent the development \nof severe complications and cannot replace local surgical or non-surgical treatment. \nAntibiotics should not be used before a dental procedure to: calm an infection; \ndecrease inflammation; cure toothache (pain relief is best achieved by a dental procedure \nnot a dental prescription); or prevent surgical site infections.\nEffective antibiotic treatment (along with a procedure for source control) is essential \nin patients with severe, spreading dental infections. Severe cases include those with systemic \nsigns of infection, for example, facial swelling, inability to open the mouth, fever \u2265 38.0 \u00b0C and \ntachycardia. Even when necessary, antibiotics should only be used to complement surgical \nsource control, for example, drainage of the abscess or tooth extraction. Antibiotic use could The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 93PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n8. Oral and dental infections \nalso be considered in severely immunocompromised patients (including patients with \nuncontrolled diabetes) because they have a higher risk of complications. When antibiotic  \ntreatment is considered necessary, empiric use of amoxicillin or phenoxymethylpenicillin as  \nindicated in Table 8.4 is considered appropriate. Using two antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin and \nmetronidazole) as adjunctive treatment is not necessary in the vast majority of cases and \nnoma is usually the only indication for dual antibiotic therapy (using two antibiotics such as \namoxicillin and metronidazole).\nThe AWaRe book does not include alternative antibiotic options in cases of allergy \nto first-choice antibiotics. For dental infections, only penicillin options are recommended \nby the AWaRe book, which may be considered problematic by some prescribers. However, \neven though allergies to antibiotics (particularly to beta-lactams) are frequently self-\nreported or indicated in health records, in most cases (> 95%), these patients do not have a \ntrue immunologically mediated allergy and it is very likely that they can safely tolerate the \nmedicine if re-exposed to it. Please refer to the chapter on allergies to antibiotics for more \ninformation about this aspect.\nPrevention\nDental caries does not occur without sugar, thus minimizing dietary free sugars is key to avoiding \ndental pain and infections caused by dental caries. Further information on dietary sugar can be \nfound in the WHO guidance document on sugar intake for adults and children (73).\nAs the progression of dental caries and periodontal disease may continue slowly \nfrom childhood to adulthood, the negative health effects of oral disease are cumulative. \nEven a small reduction in the risk factors early in life confers significant benefit in later life.\nStopping tobacco use, whether smoked or smokeless, should also be promoted for \nthe prevention of periodontal disease and oral cancer. \nPreventing the accumulation of dental plaque is important for preventing dental \ndiseases such as dental caries or periodontal disease.\nWhere people are unable to perform adequate oral hygiene themselves, regular \nprofessional dental cleaning may be necessary to maintain oral health.\nFluoride plays an important role in improving oral health by strengthening the \ntooth enamel and making it more resistant to dental caries. Further information on fluoride \nand oral health can be found on the WHO website (74). For prevention of dental caries in \nchildren, refer to the WHO guidance document (75).94 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n8.

Localized acute bacterial \nlymphadenitis\nThis chapter does not include severe or generalized infections or infections caused by viral, \nfungal or parasitic pathogens.\nKey messages\n\u2022 Antibiotics are not needed  for the great majority of cases of enlarged lymph nodes as \nthey are caused by viral infections.\n\u2022 A watchful waiting approach is reasonable when the patient is not severely ill and bacterial \nlymphadenitis or a malignancy is not suspected, because the condition is usually self-\nlimiting.\n\u2022 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, tuberculosis and spreading dental infection \nshould always be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n\u2022 If bacterial lymphadenitis is suspected, empiric antibiotic treatment should cover \nStaphylococcus aureus  and Streptococcus pyogenes  with Access group antibiotics.\nDefinition\nLymphadenitis is the inflammation and enlargement (> 1\u20132 cm) of one or several lymph \nnodes. It can be classified as localized (most cases) where only one lymph node region \nis affected or generalized when multiple lymph node regions are affected. Lymphadenitis \ncan also be classified based on the anatomical site of the lymph node region affected \n(e.g. cervical or axillary) and on the depth of the lymph node affected, either superficial \nor deep lymph nodes. Lymphadenitis has several infectious and non-infectious causes, \nincluding skin infections, dental infections, cancer or lymphoproliferative disorders. The \nterm lymphadenitis (i.e. enlargement of a lymph node with inflammatory signs) and \nlymphadenopathy (i.e. disease of a lymph node in which they are abnormal in size and/or \nconsistency) are often used interchangeably, although in lymphadenitis the inflammatory \ncomponent (redness, warmth and pain) is more pronounced. Infection in the lymph nodes \ncan be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. This chapter focuses on localized acute \nbacterial lymphadenitis, although most enlarged lymph nodes are caused by viral infections.96\nThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n9.

Localized acute bacterial lymphadenitis\nPathophysiology\nLymph nodes are an important part of the immune system which act as filters of lymph \nfluid. Lymphadenitis from an infectious cause is due to the immune system\u2019s response to \nlocalized or generalized inflammation and to the pathogen spreading to one or more lymph \nnode regions. \nEpidemiology\nLymphadenitis is a common condition worldwide and can occur at all ages; for example, \ncervical lymphadenitis occurs very frequently in healthy children. Lymphadenitis is usually \nassociated with benign conditions (e.g. most infectious causes); however, it can also be a \nsign of malignancy (e.g. lymphoma).\nSince lymphadenitis has many different causes, the epidemiology of the disease \nwill reflect the specific etiology. For example, in Africa, tuberculous lymphadenitis (the most \nfrequent cause of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB)) is still an important cause of persistent \nlymphadenitis, and chronic lymphadenopathy may be a sign of HIV infection (81).\nMost likely pathogens\nPathogens that can cause lymphadenitis are listed in Table 9.1.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 101PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n9. Localized acute bacterial lymphadenitis\nTable 9.1 \u2013 Pathogens most frequently associated with acute lymphadenitis (in \ndescending order of frequency)\nViruses Bacteria\nMost cases\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus\nCytomegalovirus\nRespiratory viruses\nMore rarely\nHIVMost cases\nStaphylococcus aureus  (including MRSA)\nStreptococcus pyogenes  (group A Streptococcus )\nMore rarelya\nAnaerobes\nBartonella henselae  (mostly following cat bites or scratches)\nChlamydia trachomatis  (serovars L1, L2 and L3 which cause \nlymphogranuloma venereum)\nCorynebacterium diphtheriae\nFrancisella tularensis\nHaemophilus ducreyi\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae\nRickettsia  spp.\nYersinia pestis\nMRSA: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus .\nNote. Pathogens associated with chronic lymphadenitis such as mycobacteria (including non-tuberculous) are not \nincluded in the table.\na This is not a full list but aims to show the variety of bacteria associated with localized lymphadenitis. The bacteria \nare listed in alphabetical order. Sexually transmitted infections and zoonoses need to be considered in the \ndifferential diagnosis.\nClinical presentation \nLymphadenitis is a noticeable enlargement (> 1\u20132 cm) of a lymph node. Acute onset, \nunilateral involvement, fluctuance and fluid that drains from the lymph node to the skin \nsuggest a bacterial cause. Tenderness and inflammation are frequently associated with \ninfectious causes. Fever (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C) and other signs and symptoms of systemic disease may \nbe present, accompanied by cellulitis. Viral respiratory infections, infectious mononucleosis \n(caused by Epstein\u2013Barr virus or cytomegalovirus), (acute) HIV infection and mycobacterial \ninfections (mostly TB) always need to be considered when diagnosing the cause of acute \nlymphadenitis based on clinical history and findings. As the first step, it is important \nto identify the cause of the enlargement. Location of the enlarged lymph node and \naccompanying signs and symptoms of infection (e.g. symptoms of a dental infection, skin \nlesions, pharyngitis and signs and symptoms of an STI) can help establish the diagnosis. \nHistory and physical examination (including palpation of lymph nodes) usually help in the \ndiagnosis and guide the investigation and treatment.102 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n9. Localized acute bacterial lymphadenitis\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nRoutine microbiology testing is usually not needed because in most cases with an infectious \ncause, identifying the etiologic agent will not change the initial management. However, HIV \ninfection and tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis and adequate \ntesting should be done when these diseases are suspected.  \nOther tests\nRoutine laboratory testing is usually not needed. However, it may be considered in certain \ncases, for example, persistent lymph node enlargement for more than 4 weeks or the \npresence of warning signs such as important weight loss.\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nRoutine surveillance is not helpful to inform empiric guidance. \nBiopsy\nAn excisional biopsy of the lymph node could be considered if a malignancy is suspected. \nAn alternative technique that can be used is fine needle aspiration, another type of biopsy \ntechnique where a very thin needle is inserted into the mass under examination for \nsampling of cells/tissue.\nImaging\nRoutine imaging is usually not needed to begin with. An ultrasound can be considered to \nconfirm lymph node involvement, to measure the size of the enlargement and to detect \nthe presence of an abscess. However, ultrasound cannot reliably rule out malignancies; in \nsuspected cases an excisional biopsy should be performed.\nAntibiotic treatment\nIn certain cases, a watchful waiting approach without antibiotics is indicated when follow-up \nis feasible and the patient is not severely ill or a malignancy is not suspected. This approach \nis reasonable because the condition is frequently self-limiting \u2013 for example, mild cervical \nlymphadenitis is usually caused by a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, especially \nin children but could also be associated with a dental infection. \nIf symptoms are consistent with a bacterial infection (e.g. fever, and painful, \ntender and inflamed lymph node), empiric treatment against Staphylococcus aureus  and \nStreptococcus pyogenes  is indicated.

Bacterial eye infections \n(excluding trachoma)\nNote\nSee separate chapter on trachoma.\nKey messages\n\u2022 Conjunctivitis  is mostly self-limiting and of viral origin. Allergies and toxic irritants should \nbe included in the differential diagnosis. Topical antibiotics can be considered if a bacterial \ninfection is suspected. Sexually transmitted infections should be included in the differential \ndiagnosis in sexually active people and in newborns of infected mothers.\n\u2022 Keratitis  is mostly caused by bacteria and viruses in high-income countries and fungi \npredominate in low- and middle-income countries. Risk factors include eye trauma and \nprolonged contact lens use; in the latter case, Acanthamoeba , a parasite, or Pseudomonas \naeruginosa  should be considered as potential causes of the infection. Topical antibiotics are \nindicated as infectious keratitis is a potentially blinding condition. \n\u2022 Endophthalmitis  mostly occurs after a penetrating eye trauma (including eye surgery) \nor dissemination to the eye of a distant infection (e.g. endocarditis). It can be caused by \nbacteria or fungi. Treatment ideally requires both intravitreal and intravenous antibiotics as it \nis a potentially blinding condition.\n\u2022 Periorbital (or preseptal) cellulitis  is usually a mild condition more common in children. \nIt can be treated with oral antibiotics active against Gram-positive pathogens from the skin \n(e.g. Staphylococcus aureus ). It is very important to distinguish periorbital (or preseptal) from \norbital cellulitis (deeper more severe infection) because the management is different.\nOther relevant WHO resources (please check regularly for updates)\n\u2022 Pocket book of hospital care for children: guidelines for the management of common \nchildhood illnesses, 2013 (31).\nDefinition\nPathogens can infect most ocular structures and present with many combinations of signs \nand symptoms.

Bacterial eye infections (excluding trachoma)\nbecause the most probable causative pathogens may differ, with implications for treatment. \nIn addition, eye infections can be acquired in different ways (e.g. exogenous or endogenous, \nsee the pathophysiology section for more information on transmission) and this also has \nimplications for treatment and helps determine the most likely causative pathogens.\nIt should be noted that many conditions presented in this chapter could also be of \nnon-infectious origin (e.g. systemic inflammatory diseases affecting other parts of the body \nor, in the case of conjunctivitis, allergies or toxic irritants), but non-infectious eye conditions \nare beyond the scope of this chapter.\nThis chapter focuses on eye infections of bacterial origin presented in \nalphabetical order .\nInfections not addressed in the AWaRe book (because they are rare) include: \ncanaliculitis (infection of the lacrimal canaliculi) and dacryocystis (infection of the lacrimal sac).\nFigure 10.1 \u2013 Eye anatomy and locations of common eye infections\nOptic ne rve\nScleraRetinaFovea\nOrbital cellulitis\nLens/uni2022.case Ocular muscle s\nPreorbital cellulitis\n/uni2022.case Eyelid\nConjunctivitis\n/uni2022.case Conjuctiva/uni2022.case Fat\nEndophth almiti s\n/uni2022.case Vitr eous humour\nKeratitis\n/uni2022.case Cornea/uni2022.case Aqueous humour\nUveitis\n/uni2022.case Pupil\n/uni2022.case Iris\n/uni2022.case Ciliary  body\n/uni2022.case Chor oidThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book107\nPRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n10.

Bacterial eye infections (excluding trachoma)\nPathophysiology\nEye infections can result either from external contamination through direct inoculation of the \npathogen into the eye/s (exogenous transmission) or from dissemination of the pathogen \nthrough the bloodstream from a distant site of infection (endogenous transmission). \nExogenous transmission can occur by contact with infected secretions (mostly by rubbing \nthe eye/s with contaminated hands), or as a result of a penetrating eye injury, which \nincludes eye surgery where bacteria from the flora could be introduced. The use of contact \nlenses and eye contact with water (e.g. during swimming) are also risk factors for exogenous \ntransmission. In addition, certain STIs (e.g. gonococcal and chlamydial infections) can be \ntransmitted from infected mothers to their child during vaginal delivery. Endogenous \ntransmission occurs when pathogens are spread through the bloodstream from other sites \nof infection (e.g. in the case of endocarditis, UTIs, abdominal abscesses, meningitis and \nindwelling catheters), mainly in high-risk patients, such as immunocompromised patients \nand people who inject drugs.\nBlepharitis\nDefinition\nBlepharitis is an infection of the eyelid margin. It can be anterior (less common than \nposterior blepharitis and characterized by inflammation at the base of the eyelashes) or \nposterior (more common, characterized by inflammation of the inner portion of the eyelid \nat the level of the meibomian glands). \nHordeolum (stye) is a common acute bacterial infection of one or more eyelid glands.\nEpidemiology\nBlepharitis is a chronic condition and most cases are not due to infections but to a \ndysfunction of oil glands in the eyelids. In posterior blepharitis (the most common form), \nchronic infections may also play a role. The bacteria that comprise the flora in posterior \nblepharitis are the same as those found on the skin but are present in greater numbers (82).\nMost likely pathogens\nThe most common causative pathogens of blepharitis are shown in Table 10.1.118 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n10. Bacterial eye infections (excluding trachoma)\nTable 10.1 \u2013 Pathogens most frequently associated with blepharitis (in descending \norder of frequency)\nType of organism Pathogen\nBacteria Staphylococcus aureus\nCoagulase-negative Staphylococcus\nMites Demodex folliculoruma\nDemodex brevisb\nNote. Blepharitis does not usually have an infectious origin.\na Demodex folliculorum  has been identified in 30% of patients with chronic anterior blepharitis but is also found \nwith about the same prevalence in asymptomatic people. However, this organism is clearly a contributing factor in \nsome patients as evidenced by the improvement seen in response to eradication therapy.\nb Demodex brevis  has been associated with posterior blepharitis. \nClinical presentation \nPatients with blepharitis typically present with inflamed eyelids that are red, swollen and \nitchy with crusts at the base of the eyelid and on the eyelashes mostly in the morning. \nUsually both eyes are affected and most cases are chronic.\nBlepharitis is more common in adults than in children, but children can have severe \nepisodes of anterior and/or posterior blepharitis, often characterized by more conjunctival \nand corneal findings (83,84) .\nBlepharitis related to Demodex  infestation characteristically presents with cylindrical \ndandruff or \u201csleeves\u201d on the eyelashes (85). Patients with hordeolum usually present with a \ntender swelling of the eyelid/s with a lash at its apex.\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nMicrobiology tests are not usually needed.\nOther tests\nLaboratory tests (other than microbiology) are not usually helpful.\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nRoutine surveillance is not helpful to inform empiric guidance.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 119PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n10. Bacterial eye infections (excluding trachoma)\nImaging\nImaging is usually not needed.\nAntibiotic treatment \nAntibiotic treatment is not usually needed. Good eyelid hygiene is the most important \ntreatment and cases usually resolve without further measures. Warm compresses 5 to 10 \nminutes two to four times per day, lid massage and washing, and use of preservative-free \nartificial tears four to eight times per day can also help. \nPatients with severe or refractory symptoms may require additional therapies but \nthis is beyond the scope of this chapter. \nConjunctivitis\nDefinition\nConjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva, the mucosa that covers the inside part of \nthe eyelids and the outer surface of the eye \u2013 the sclera. \nEpidemiology\nConjunctivitis is the most frequent eye infection and most cases are of viral origin in both \nchildren and adults. Bacterial cases, although less common, can occur, especially in children. \nNon-infectious causes (mostly allergies but sometimes also toxic irritants) should always be \nconsidered in the differential diagnosis (86). Most cases of conjunctivitis are exogenous and \ninfection is mostly acquired by touching the eye with contaminated hands.\nMost likely pathogens\nPathogens most frequently associated with conjunctivitis (86) are shown in Table10.2.120 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n10.

They often describe a feeling of \u201csand in the eye\u201d with no pain (if there is \npain, this usually indicates corneal involvement) and they have normal vision. In cases of \nbacterial infection, a thick purulent discharge from the eye is usually present. Patients may \nrefer to all discharge as pus; however, in bacterial conjunctivitis, the complaint of discharge \npredominates, while in viral and allergic conjunctivitis, patients report a burning and gritty \nfeeling or itching and the eye usually presents with a watery discharge. In most cases, \nconjunctivitis is a mild self-limiting condition. \nA severe form of conjunctivitis is hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis which is mostly \ncaused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . It is characterized by severe purulent discharge and decreased \nvision. Usually, eyelid swelling, pain on palpation and preauricular adenopathy are present (86). \nIn neonates, conjunctivitis can be caused by a range of pathogens. In general, \ngonococcal or staphylococcal infection is more likely to present early with symptoms in the \nfirst 5 days of life, with chlamydial infection generally presenting later (> 5 days after birth).The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 121PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n10.

In patients with typical presentation of bacterial conjunctivitis \n(i.e. red eye with purulent discharge and normal vision), antibiotic treatment could be \nconsidered to shorten the duration of symptoms (88) based on the patient\u2019s preferences. \nIn these cases, antibiotic treatment is usually topical (eye drops or eye ointment) and \nprescribed empirically (Table 10.3) based on local availability. Systemic antibiotic treatment \nis only required in cases of systemic infections, for example, conjunctivitis in the context of \nan STI (Table 10.3). Steroid eye drops (alone or in combination with antibiotic drops) are not \nusually needed for the treatment of conjunctivitis; in fact, steroids might even make the \ncondition worse if it is caused by herpes virus infection or the cornea is affected.\nUrgent referral of the patient to an ophthalmologist, if available, should be considered \nwhen hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis (mostly caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae ) is \nsuspected because of the risk of rapid progression to corneal perforation.122 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n10.

Endogenous cases of \nendophthalmitis are rare but can occur because of bacteraemia or fungaemia from \ndistant sites of infection, most often endocarditis and liver abscess depending on the \nsetting (90,91) . Injection of drugs is a common risk factor in patients with endogenous \ninfections. Endophthalmitis refers to bacterial or fungal infection within the eye, \nincluding involvement of the vitreous and/or aqueous humours. Endophthalmitis is not \ncaused by viruses or parasites; infections due to these organisms are included in the \nterm uveitis (92).\nMost likely pathogens\nTable 10.4 shows the most common causative pathogens associated with endophthalmitis.124 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n10.

Most cases are exogenous \nand typically occur after eye surgery (usually within days or a few weeks) or trauma. In rare \ncases, endophthalmitis can result from the haematogenous spread of pathogens from distant \nsites of infection, such as endocarditis and liver abscess. In these cases, signs and symptoms \nof bacteraemia can be present although in most cases ocular symptoms occur first.\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nMicrobiology tests to consider when endophthalmitis is suspected are shown in Table 10.5.\nA positive culture of aqueous or vitreous humour in the presence of compatible \nsigns and symptoms could confirm the diagnosis.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 125PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n10.

Urgent referral of \nthe patient to an ophthalmologist, if available, should be considered when endophthalmitis \nis suspected because this condition could potentially threaten the patient\u2019s sight.\nWith bacterial endophthalmitis, the cornerstone of treatment is intravitreal injection \nof antibiotics. There are two common approaches:\n\u2022  \u201ctap and inject\u201d: first a sample of vitreous humour is collected for culture (through \nvitreous aspiration) and then antibiotics are injected into the vitreous\n\u2022 vitrectomy is performed \u2013 that is, eye surgery to remove some or all the inflamed \nvitreous from the eye as a form of source control \u2013 and during the procedure, the \nantibiotic is injected into the vitreous.126 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n10. Bacterial eye infections (excluding trachoma)\nSystemic antibiotics (in combination with intravitreal antibiotics) should also be \nconsidered given the severity of this condition, especially when referral to an ophthalmologist \nis not readily available (Table 10.6). In cases of endogenous infections, systemic antibiotics \nshould always be given. However, evidence of their added benefit (e.g. on visual acuity) \ncompared to intravitreal treatment alone is still controversial. The ability to rapidly reach \nadequate concentrations of antibiotics in the eye varies by antibiotic (95). \nThere is limited evidence of the benefit of additive treatment with intravitreal steroid \ntherapy compared to antibiotics alone (96).\nTable 10.6 \u2013 Empiric antibiotic treatment for bacterial endophthalmitis\nType of bacterial \nendophthalmitisAntibiotic treatment Total treatment \nduration\nExogenous Intravitreal injection\n Vancomycin  1 mg AND\n Ceftazidime  2.25 mg\nSystemic antibiotics alone are not effective in \ntreating bacterial exogenous endophthalmitis. \nWhether systemic antibiotics provide any benefit \nin these cases as adjunctive therapy to intravitreal \nantibiotics is still debatable.Intravitreal \nantibiotics: single \ndose.

Bacterial eye infections (excluding trachoma)\nKeratitis\nDefinition\nKeratitis is an infection of the cornea, the transparent covering of the eye.\nEpidemiology\nKeratitis is common and the estimated number of cases is more than 2 million per year (97). The \nhighest (epidemic) burden is in South, South-East and East Asia (97), especially in rural settings \namong male workers in high-risk professions as eye trauma is the predominant risk factor (98). \nIn high-income countries, the number of cases of keratitis has increased over time, probably \nbecause of the increased use of contact lenses; their use is currently the most common risk factor \nin this setting. The disease is rare in children, but it is also harder to diagnose, mostly because it is \nmore difficult to obtain a clinical history and to collect a sample for microbiology tests. \nMost likely pathogens\nThe most common pathogens causing keratitis (97,98)  are shown in Table 10.7.\nTable 10.7 \u2013 Pathogens most frequently associated with keratitisa (in descending \norder of frequency)\nType of organism Pathogen\nFungi Mostly\nFusarium  spp.\nAspergillus  spp.\nBacteria Pseudomonas  spp. (contact lenses)\nStaphylococcus epidermidis\nStaphylococcus aureus\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\nViruses Mostly\nHerpes simplex virus (usually type 1)\nVaricella zoster virus\nParasites Acanthamoeba  (contact lenses)\na Bacteria and viruses are the most common causes of keratitis in high-income countries, while fungi predominate \nin low- and middle-income countries. Global variations in etiology largely reflect patient-based risk factors such \nas population demographic, occupation, contact lens use, concomitant ocular and systemic illness, as well as \nenvironmental factors such as geographical location, climate and virulence of causative organisms. For example, \nPseudomonas  spp. and Acanthamoeba  spp. are often associated with the use of contact lenses and fungal keratitis \nmust be considered after any traumatic corneal injury, notably from vegetable matter. In the paediatric population, \nthere appears to be a higher incidence of atypical infections, for example, due to Acanthamoeba  (97).128 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n10. Bacterial eye infections (excluding trachoma)\nClinical presentation \nPatients with keratitis generally present with a painful eye, decreased vision, more tears and \ncorneal oedema. They often describe a feeling of \u201chaving something in the eye\u201d and have \ndifficulty keeping the affected eye open. A discharge from the eye may be seen depending \non the causative pathogen. Most infectious cases are of bacterial origin, although in low-\nand middle-income countries, fungal infections are common, for example, as a result of \ntrauma from plants or sand or mud in rural settings (97). Reactivation of herpes simplex \nvirus could also cause keratitis, especially in patients with HIV infection or in patients \nwith other forms of immunosuppression. Ophthalmologic examination with a slit lamp is \nusually needed to visualize the cornea and confirm the diagnosis: focal white infiltrates in \nthe corneal stroma with an epithelial defect and underlying tissue loss are the critical sign \nof keratitis.\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nA positive culture in the presence of compatible signs and symptoms could confirm the \ndiagnosis (Table 10.8).\nTable 10.8 \u2013 Microbiology tests to consider when keratitis is suspected as \nindicated in the WHO EDL (6)\nDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Settings where the test \nshould be available\nMicroscopy (Gram stain) \nand culture of corneal \nscrapings or corneal \nbiopsy materialMicrobial morphology and \ndetection and identification of \nbacterial and fungal species \nfor selection of appropriate \nantimicrobial regimensHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\nEDL: WHO Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics.\nNote.

Bacterial eye infections (excluding trachoma)\nImaging\nImaging is usually not needed. Specialist eye examination may be considered.\nAntibiotic treatment \nPatients should stop wearing contact lenses. Topical antibiotic treatment is indicated even \nthough consensus on the most effective treatment is lacking (Table 10.9) (99). Cycloplegic eye \ndrops (cyclopentolate 1% or atropine 1%) can be used for comfort, to reduce photophobia \nfrom ciliary spasm and to reduce the formation of pupillary adhesions to the lens. \nOral antibiotics can be considered in selected cases (e.g. scleral extension or \nimpending perforation) or in case of gonococcal infection. With viral keratitis, topical and \noral antiviral treatment is usually indicated (but management of viral infections is beyond \nthe scope of this chapter).\nNote\nInfectious keratitis is an ocular emergency as it is a potentially blinding condition for which the \nprospect of visual restoration is often poor.\nTable 10.9 \u2013 Empiric antibiotic treatment for bacterial keratitis\nAntibiotic treatment Total treatment duration\nChildren and adults\n Ofloxacin  a (eye drops): 0.3%, 1 drop in the \naffected eye every hour for 48 hours then every \n4 hours until healed2 weeks but duration is often \npersonalized to the individual based on \nclinical improvement.\na A fluoroquinolone is usually given to patients who wear contact lenses because Pseudomonas aeruginosa  is often \nthe causative pathogen. For most patients, hourly treatment is indicated for the first 24 to 48 hours. Drops are \npreferred because ointments have poor corneal penetration. However, ointments may be used at bedtime to allow \nthe patient to sleep through the night, but only after a positive response has been demonstrated to the initial \nintensive eyedrop treatment.\nLegend: ACCESS antibiotics are indicated in green, WATCH antibiotics in orange and RESERVE antibiotics in red. 130 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n10.

The eyelids are usually swollen, red, warm and tender. Sometimes fever \nis present (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C). These findings are also present in cases of periorbital (or preseptal) \ncellulitis (see next section); however, in addition to these symptoms, patients with orbital \ncellulitis present with restricted extraocular motility with pain on attempted eye movement, \nconjunctival chemosis (i.e. swelling) and hyperaemia (i.e. redness) as critical signs. Usually this \ncondition is accompanied by protrusion of the eye (i.e. proptosis) and loss of vision may be \npresent (101) . Signs of optic neuropathy (e.g. afferent pupillary defect and dyschromatopsia) \nmay be present in severe cases. In neglected cases, orbital cellulitis may lead to cavernous \nsinus thrombosis, brain abscess or even death.\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nBlood cultures and cultures of samples collected can be considered (Table 10.11).\nTable 10.11 \u2013 Microbiology tests to consider when orbital cellulitis is suspected as \nindicated in the WHO EDL (6)\nDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Settings where the test \nshould be available\nMicroscopy (Gram stain), \nculture and antimicrobial \nsusceptibility testing of \nabscess materialMicrobial morphology and detection \nand identification of bacterial and \nfungal species for selection of \nappropriate antimicrobial regimensHealth care facilities \nwith clinical laboratories\nBlood cultures \nand antimicrobial \nsusceptibility testingTo detect bacterial and fungal \nbloodstream infectionsHealth care facilities \nwith clinical laboratories\nEDL: WHO Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics.\nOther tests\nLaboratory tests (other than microbiology) are usually not helpful.\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nRoutine surveillance is not helpful to inform empiric guidance. 132 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n10.

Most \npatients with uncomplicated orbital cellulitis can be treated with antibiotics alone (102,103) .\nSurgery for source control (e.g. drainage of purulent collections) may be needed \nin severe and complicated cases (e.g. in cases of abscess) in combination with systemic \nantibiotic treatment (104,105) . Surgery is almost always indicated in patients with intracranial \nextension of the infection.\nPeriorbital (or preseptal) cellulitis\nDefinition\nPeriorbital (or preseptal) cellulitis is an infection of subcutaneous eyelid tissues anterior to \nthe orbital septum; in this case, the globe and the tissues within the bony orbit are not \ninvolved.\nEpidemiology\nThis is usually a mild condition that most commonly affects children. Most cases are \nexogenous and result from adjacent infection (hordeolum, dacryocystitis, infection of the \nperiorbital sinuses, severe dental infection) or follow animal and insect bites or trauma of the \neyelid. Periorbital (or preseptal) cellulitis is much more common than orbital cellulitis (106) .\nThe most common pathogens associated with periorbital (or preseptal) cellulitis are \nshown in Table 10.12.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 133PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n10.

Bacterial eye infections (excluding trachoma)\nImaging\nA CT scan of the orbits and sinuses (axial, coronal, and parasagittal views, with contrast if \npossible) could be considered. The reason for doing a CT scan is to assess the presence or \nabsence of orbital involvement when the diagnosis is uncertain and the presence of possible \ncomplications is suspected, for example, subperiosteal or orbital abscess, cavernous sinus \nthrombosis, or intracranial extension. \nAntibiotic treatment\nSystemic antibiotic treatment is indicated and is usually given empirically based on the most \nlikely causative pathogens because cultures are difficult to obtain and blood cultures when \nperformed are usually negative (Table 10.13). Empiric treatment of MRSA may be considered \nin certain cases based on individual risk factors (e.g. known MRSA colonization) and on the \nlocal prevalence of community-acquired MRSA.

Bacterial eye infections (excluding trachoma)\nInfectious uveitis\nDefinition\nUveitis is an infection of the uvea, which is composed of:\n\u2022 iris \u2013 the coloured ring-shaped part of the eye behind the cornea\n\u2022 ciliary body \u2013 the part that extends around the iris, has a muscular component \nand produces the aqueous humour that keeps the eye in a pressurized state\n\u2022 choroid \u2013 a vascular layer.\nEpidemiology\nInfectious uveitis can be caused by a large number of pathogens and most cases are \nassociated with systemic infections, but it may also occur as an isolated condition. Therefore, \nthe epidemiology depends on the underlying infection. In general, certain factors can \nincrease the risk of specific infections, for example, cytomegalovirus is mostly associated \nwith uveitis in immunocompromised patients. \nMost likely pathogens\nTable 10.14 shows the most common causative pathogens of uveitis.\nTable 10.14 \u2013 Pathogens most frequently associated with uveitisa (in alphabetical \norder)\nType of organism Pathogen\nBacteria Bartonella henselae  (with cat-scratch disease)\nMycobacterium tuberculosisb\nTreponema pallidum  (with neurosyphilis)\nParasites Toxoplasma gondii\nViruses Cytomegalovirus\nHerpes simplex virus\nVaricella-zoster virus\na Usually in the context of infectious or autoimmune or inflammatory systemic conditions. Therefore consider \nindividual risk factors and presentation to identify the most likely causative pathogen.\nb Ocular tuberculosis usually results from haematogenous dissemination of the infection from pulmonary or extra-\npulmonary sites.138 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n10. Bacterial eye infections (excluding trachoma)\nClinical presentation \nThe symptoms of uveitis are non-specific and depend on the portion of the uveal tract \nthat is involved. Findings also differ depending upon the location of the involvement, and \nvisual loss may occur with anterior, intermediate or posterior involvement. Anterior uveitis \nis about four times more common than posterior uveitis (108) . Patients with uveitis usually \nhave a painful red eye and decreased vision. Infectious forms of uveitis are mostly of viral \norigin (e.g. herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus) or they may occur as a reactivation of \ntoxoplasmosis.\nWhen uveitis is suspected, patients should be seen by an ophthalmologist, if \navailable, because the list of potential conditions associated with uveitis is large and, in \nsome cases, uveitis is a potentially sight-threatening condition.\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nThe need for microbiology tests should be guided by the type of eye infection suspected \n(see Table 10.15 for tests to consider). \nTable 10.15 \u2013 Microbiology tests to consider when uveitis is suspected as indicated \nin the WHO EDL (6)\nDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Settings where the test \nshould be available\nMicroscopy (Gram \nstain) and cultureaMicrobial morphology and detection \nand identification of bacterial species \nfor selection of appropriate antibiotic \nregimensHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\nEDL: Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics.\nNote. Nucleic acid amplification testing (i.e. polymerase chain reaction) for viral etiology (e.g. herpes simplex virus) \ncould be considered based on clinical presentation and individual risk factors.\na Depending on the type of infection, consider conjunctival swabs, corneal scrapings or corneal biopsy, aqueous or \nvitreous humour aspirate.\nOther tests\nLaboratory tests (other than microbiology) are usually not helpful.\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nRoutine surveillance is not helpful to inform empiric guidance.

Trachoma\nPathogen\nTrachoma is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , a Gram-negative obligate intracellular \nbacterium. There are several strains of Chlamydia trachomatis , some associated with \ntrachoma and some associated with sexually transmitted urogenital diseases. Strains \nassociated with trachoma are serovars A, B, Ba and C.\nPathophysiology\nChlamydia trachomatis  infection spreads via the hands through direct contact with \ncontaminated people or objects. Flies can also spread the infection by transporting \ncontaminated eye and/or nose secretions from infected to non-infected people. Chronic \ninflammation of the conjunctiva caused by repeated infections over the years can cause \ninversion of the eyelashes that can lead to permanent corneal damage through formation of \nscars on the cornea (the transparent front part of the eye). This can eventually lead to vision \nimpairment and blindness (113) .\nEpidemiology\nTrachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness in the world and is responsible for \nabout 1% of cases of blindness. According to the most recent WHO estimates, more than \n137 million people worldwide live with trachoma (109) . The infection is a public health \nproblem in over 40 countries, most of which are in Africa (109) . \nRisk factors of trachoma include living in overcrowded conditions and poor \nsanitation, and most transmission occurs within families. Active disease (i.e. conjunctivitis) \nis more common in young children living in endemic areas. Children younger than 10 years \nand those with intense inflammatory trachoma probably represent the main source of ocular \nChlamydia trachomatis  infection in endemic communities (114) . Corneal scars are mostly seen \nin adults because repeated infections over time need to occur before permanent corneal \ndamage is established. Individuals with corneal scars are at increased risk of blindness.\nIn 1993, WHO adopted the SAFE strategy for the elimination of trachoma: \n\u2022 Surgery to treat advanced diseases,\n\u2022 Antibiotics to clear infection,\n\u2022 Facial cleanliness and\n\u2022 Environmental improvement to reduce transmission.\nIn 1996, WHO established the alliance for the global elimination of trachoma, whose \ngoal was to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020 (Box 11.1). In addition, in  144 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n11. Trachoma\n1998, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution on trachoma to urge WHO Member \nStates to implement measures to target the elimination of trachoma (110) . As of July 2020, \n13 out of 30 countries that are implementing the SAFE strategy have achieved the WHO \nelimination targets. As part of the elimination strategy, data reported to WHO for 2019 \nindicate that about 92 000 people had corrective surgery for trichiasis and 95 million people \nreceived antibiotic treatment, that is, 57% of people needing antibiotics for trachoma \nreceived them (109) .\nBox 11.1 \u2013 World Health Organization definitions related to trachoma\nWHO defines trachoma as a public health problem when:\n\u2022 the prevalence of follicular trachoma in children aged 1\u20139 years is \u2265 10% (see the section \non clinical presentation for the classification of trachoma), or \n\u2022 the prevalence of trachomatous trichiasis in people aged \u2265 15 years is at least 1%.\nWHO criteria for defining elimination of trachoma as a public health problem are (115) :\n\u2022 the prevalence of follicular trachoma in children aged 1\u20139 years is < 5% or\n\u2022 the prevalence of trachomatous trichiasis in people aged \u2265 15 years is < 0.2% and\n\u2022 there is evidence that the health system can identify and manage cases of trachomatous \ntrichiasis.\nClinical presentation\nTrachoma diagnosis is based on clinical signs. Trachoma presents as an active disease (i.e. \nconjunctivitis) with symptoms such as redness of the eye, eye discomfort, mucopurulent \ndischarge and light sensitivity. \nThe other presentation is the advanced disease where there is conjunctival scarring, \nsigns of chronic conjunctival inflammation and eyelashes turned inwards. \nThe WHO trachoma grading system is used in field assessments to evaluate the \nextent of disease during examination (111) . \nThe grading system includes:\n\u2022 Trachomatous inflammation, follicular \u2013 five or more follicles of > 0.5 mm on a \nspecific area of the upper tarsal conjunctiva \n\u2022 Trachomatous inflammation, intense \u2013 papillary hypertrophy and inflammatory \nthickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva obscuring more than half the deep \ntarsal vessels The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 145PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n11.

Community-acquired pneumonia \u2013 mild\nPathophysiology\nCAP occurs when microbial pathogens (usually inhaled in the upper airways) reach the \nlower respiratory tract and proliferate in the alveoli. Less frequently, these pathogens can \nalso reach the alveoli via the blood or by direct spread, for example, from an infection of the \npleural or intra-abdominal space. Once in the alveoli, host immune defences are activated \nto eliminate the pathogens. Only when these defences fail, pneumonia manifests itself \nbecause of the tissue damage and inflammatory response triggered by the proliferation of \nmicroorganisms in the affected lung(s).\nEpidemiology \nCAP is common worldwide and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with an \nespecially high burden in low-income countries (120) . According to the Global Burden of \nDisease study, in 2017 there were an estimated 471 million new cases of lower respiratory \ntract infections globally among all ages and sexes combined. This number included \nCAP cases but also a majority of cases of viral bronchitis \u2013 therefore caution is needed in \ninterpreting this number (44). The incidence of CAP varies with age and a country\u2019s income \nlevel. The most common causative pathogens worldwide are Streptococcus pneumoniae  and \nviruses (see the following section); viral\u2013bacterial coinfections may occur. \nIn low-income countries, lower respiratory tract infections (including CAP) were the \nleading cause of death in 2016, with a crude yearly attributable mortality of about 75 per \n100 000 population (121) . In general, the incidence of CAP is highest in children younger \nthan 5 years in these countries. In 2015, an estimated 0.9 million children younger than 5 \nyears died of pneumonia and of these, about 0.5 million occurred in sub-Saharan Africa \n(122) . Undernutrition, HIV infection, exposure to smoke and air pollution are common \nrisk factors for severe CAP in children younger than 5 years. As a result of better access to \nmedical care, better nutrition and greater vaccination coverage, global mortality rates in \nchildren have declined by more than 30% since 2000. In high-income countries, CAP mainly \naffects adults 65 years and older and, in general, the incidence of CAP and risk of death \nincrease with age (123) . \nMost likely pathogens\nIn neonates and young infants aged up to 2 months , pneumonia is mainly caused by \nStreptococcus pneumoniae , group B Streptococcus , Enterobacterales or Staphylococcus aureus . \nIn children aged 2 months to 5 years , pneumonia is more likely to be of viral \norigin, for example, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza and parainfluenza virus. The most \nimportant bacterial pathogen in children younger than 5 years is Streptococcus pneumoniae . 154 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n12. Community-acquired pneumonia \u2013 mild\nIn older children  Streptococcus pneumoniae  is still common but atypical bacteria such as \nMycoplasma pneumoniae  and Chlamydia pneumoniae  may be the cause. So-called atypical \nbacteria have intrinsic resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and cannot by visualized by \nGram staining. Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis  and Staphylococcus aureus  also \ncause CAP in some children (Table 12.1). \nIn adults , viruses are common causes of CAP , either by directly causing pneumonia \nor by favouring superinfection with bacteria. Among bacteria, the most common causative \nagents are Streptococcus pneumoniae , followed by atypical bacteria (see definition in the \nparagraph above) such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Chlamydia pneumoniae  and Legionella \npneumophila . Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis  and Staphylococcus aureus  are \nalso quite common (Table 12.1). \nHowever, determining the cause of bacterial pneumonia is difficult in all age groups \nand no causative pathogen is identified in most cases, even if extensive microbiological \ntests are performed, which is usually not the case for mild cases. Furthermore, there may \nbe important geographic differences in the cause of pneumonia; for example, Burkholderia \npseudomallei  is a cause of CAP in South-East Asia, while Coxiella burnetii  is more common in \nregions where exposure to livestock is common.\nTable 12.1 \u2013 Pathogens most frequently associated with community-acquired \npneumonia (in descending order of frequency)\nTypical bacteria Atypical \nbacteriabRespiratory viruses Other pathogens \nto consider in \nspecific settings\nStreptococcus \npneumoniaea\nHaemophilus \ninfluenzae\nMoraxella catarrhalis\nStaphylococcus aureus\nEnterobacterales \n(e.g. Escherichia coli , \nKlebsiella pneumoniae )Mycoplasma \npneumoniaeb\nChlamydia \npneumoniaeb \nand Chlamydia \npsittacib\nLegionella  spp.\nCoxiella burnetiiInfluenza virus (A and B)\nRespiratory syncytial virusc\nMetapneumovirus\nParainfluenza virus \nCoronavirus (including \nSARS-CoV-2)\nAdenovirus\nRhinovirus\nOther respiratory virusesBurkholderia \npseudomallei (South-\nEast Asia, Australia)\nMycobacterium \ntuberculosis\nPneumocystis \njirovecii  (in people \nwith HIV or other \ntypes of cellular \nimmunosuppression)\nHIV: human immunodeficiency virus; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2.\na The most common bacterial cause of community acquired pneumonia in all age groups (beyond the first week of \nlife) is Streptococcus pneumoniae .\nb Atypical bacteria remain colourless with Gram staining. They also have intrinsic resistance to beta-lactams. \nMycoplasma pneumoniae  and Chlamydia  spp. are more frequent in children > 5 years (compared with younger \nchildren) and in young adults. Risk factors for Chlamydia psittaci  include exposure to birds.\nc Up to 50% of cases of pneumonia in children < 5 years are caused by a virus, most commonly respiratory syncytial virus.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 155PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n12. Community-acquired pneumonia \u2013 mild\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia caused by \nantibiotic-resistant pathogens\nAMR is a potential problem with all pathogens associated with CAP . However, clinically \nrelevant high-level beta-lactam resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae  is still rare globally. \nResistance to macrolides in Streptococcus pneumoniae  and Mycoplasma pneumoniae  is \nhighly prevalent in some settings (124,125) .\nNote\nCAP caused by low-level and intermediate-level pneumococcal penicillin resistance can be \nsuccessfully treated with higher oral doses of the Access antibiotics amoxicillin or penicillin in \nchildren and adults.\nThere is no evidence of improved clinical outcomes in patients with pneumococcal \npneumonia in the primary health care setting treated with oral cephalosporins, \namoxicillin+clavulanic acid or macrolides compared to amoxicillin and penicillin, and these \nantibiotics are associated with higher rates of toxicity. \nClinical presentation\nNearly all respiratory diseases can mimic the symptoms of CAP . Based on clinical features \nalone it is often impossible to distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia or from other non-\ninfectious causes. Local epidemiology and laboratory tests may help.\nWell established clinical features of CAP include a combination of new onset (less \nthan 2 weeks) of symptoms, worsening cough with or without sputum production, dyspnoea \n(difficulty in breathing), tachypnoea (abnormal respiratory rates to diagnose rapid breathing \nvary with age), reduced oxygen saturation, crepitations on lung auscultation, or chest pain or \ndiscomfort without an alternative explanation. Fever \u2265 38.0 \u00b0C for 3\u20134 days is usually present \nbut may be absent, especially in elderly people. Extrapulmonary features such as confusion \nor disorientation may be the main symptoms in elderly people, immunocompromised \npatients and malnourished children. The severity of signs and symptoms may range from \na mild disease that can be safely managed in an outpatient setting with oral antibiotic \ntreatment to severe pneumonia with respiratory distress, sepsis requiring intensive care and \nintravenous antibiotic treatment, and a high associated mortality.\nIn children, WHO defines fast breathing pneumonia as a child with a high respiratory \nrate for their age (> 50 breaths/minute in children 2\u201311 months of age; > 40 breaths/minute \nin children aged 1\u20135 years). They may or may not have chest indrawing.  156 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n12. Community-acquired pneumonia \u2013 mild\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nIn mild cases that can be managed in the outpatient setting, microbiology tests are usually \nnot needed. Tests for COVID-19 and influenza can be considered if clinically indicated and \navailable. The TB lipoarabinomannan rapid antigen urinary test should be considered in \npatients living with HIV who are severely immunocompromised and who present with signs \nand symptoms of TB.\nFor more information on this topic, the interested reader can refer to the 2019 WHO \npolicy update: Lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay (LF-LAM) for the diagnosis of active \ntuberculosis in people living with HIV: policy update 2019 (126) .\nOther tests\nIn mild cases, laboratory tests are usually not needed. If available, point-of-care testing for \nC-reactive protein could be considered in adult patients if there is diagnostic uncertainty.\nIn general, C-reactive protein has good negative predictive value, and a negative \ntest can be used to help rule out bacterial pneumonia, unless the pre-test probability is high \nor the clinical presentation is severe.\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nThe great majority of episodes of CAP in the primary care setting are caused by pneumococcal \nisolates that clinically respond to oral penicillins. Therefore, routine clinical microbiology \nsurveillance of CAP does not help to inform local empiric guidance. \nImaging\nWhen mild CAP is suspected clinically, a chest X-ray is usually not necessary.\nScores to determine disease severity and guide \ntreatment decisions\nWHO recommends that children who meet the criteria of severe pneumonia should be \nadmitted to hospital (see the hospital facility section for the management of severe cases). \nAs a general rule for children, hospitalization is indicated in cases of severe illness \n(e.g. cough and severe respiratory distress, marked tachypnoea and tachycardia) and/or if \nthe child is unable to take oral therapy. The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 157PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n12. Community-acquired pneumonia \u2013 mild\nIn children , severe pneumonia is characterized by signs of pneumonia (fast \nbreathing with or without chest indrawing) plus a general danger sign, such as inability to \nbreastfeed or drink, convulsions, lethargy or a reduced level of consciousness (118) .\nIn adults , several scores exist that measure severity and help predict 30-day \nmortality. These scores, in addition to clinical judgement, can be used to determine the need \nfor hospitalization in immunocompetent adults diagnosed with CAP . In view of its simplicity, \none of the more frequently used scores is the CURB-65 (127) , or its modification, CRB-65, \nwhich does not require laboratory values for its calculation (Table 12.2). However, it should \nbe noted that these scores have not been extensively validated in low-income settings and \nfor this reason there is no clear consensus about their use in these settings (128) . As well \nas severity scores, other factors, such as severe comorbid illnesses (e.g. HIV infection) or \ninability to maintain oral therapy, should always be taken into account in determining the \nneed for hospital admission.\nTable 12.2 \u2013 CURB-65 criteria and scoring, and treatment decisions for community-\nacquired pneumonia\nCriterion Points\nPresence of confusion (new onset) 1\nUrea > 19 mg/dL (or > 7 mmol/L)a1\nRespiratory rate > 30 breaths/min 1\nSystolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg (< 12 kPa) \nor diastolic blood pressure \u2264 60 mmHg (\u2264 8 kPa)1\nAge \u2265 65 years 1\nCURB-65 score/CRB-65 score Where to treat\n0\u20131 Candidate for outpatient treatment\nLow 30-day mortality risk (< 1.5%)\n2 Consider inpatient treatment\n30-day mortality risk \u2248 10%\nConsider adding clarithromycin (see \nCommunity-acquired pneumonia \u2013 severe)\nIf tests are available, consider testing for \natypical pathogens (e.g. Legionella  spp., \nMycoplasma  spp.)\ncontinues158 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n12.

The CURB-65 score is not validated in low-and middle-income countries.\na Urea is not required for the calculation of the CRB-65 score, a modification of the CURB-65 score that does not \nrequire laboratory tests.\nRuling out tuberculosis\nTB is a cause of subacute lower respiratory tract infection and should be considered in \nsettings endemic for TB, especially in high-risk patients (e.g. children or adults with HIV), \nwith a slow onset of symptoms and persistent cough, or those who do not respond to the \ninitial antibiotic treatment. In such cases, specific investigations for TB should be done. A \nrapid molecular test (GeneXpert\u00ae MTB/RIF assay) performed on a single sputum specimen \nis currently the preferred first-line diagnostic test for pulmonary TB and to detect rifampicin \nresistance in both children and adults. When this rapid test is not available, microscopy \nexamination of sputum smears could be considered for the detection of acid-fast bacilli \n(129) .

Available vaccines are active against \npneumococcal infection, Haemophilus influenzae  type b disease and influenza, and several \nvaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are available. Vaccines are never 100% effective and because \nthey are serogroup-specific, they do not protect against all strains of bacteria or viruses. \nDuration of protection is also variable. As a result, even vaccinated people can develop \nCAP . Haemophilus influenzae  type b conjugate vaccines and pneumococcal conjugate \nvaccines should be included in all routine infant immunization programmes as they have \nbeen very successful in reducing invasive disease and in many countries, in reducing rates \nof pneumococcal resistance. Countries should consider the inclusion of yearly seasonal \ninfluenza vaccination for high-risk populations (pregnant women, elderly people, patients \nwith chronic medical conditions and health care workers) in their vaccination plan.162 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n13.

Exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nPathophysiology\nExacerbations of COPD are a worsening of the existing underlying chronic inflammation \nof the respiratory tract and are caused in most cases by irritants (e.g. pollution, smoking, \ndusts and chemicals) or respiratory tract infections. Exacerbations can accelerate a decline in \nlung function (i.e. disease progression). The frequency of exacerbations of COPD is variable \namong individuals with COPD but they occur more often in cases of severe COPD (135) .\nEpidemiology \nAccording to the Global Burden of Diseases study, in 2017, there were 299 million prevalent \ncases of COPD and 3.19 million deaths caused by COPD (44,136) . In 2014, more than 90% of \ndeaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries (137) .\nCOPD includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. The most prevalent risk factor \nis exposure to tobacco smoke and indoor household air pollution (138) . The incidence of \nexacerbations increases with age, especially in smokers, and mortality is higher in severe \nepisodes.\nMost likely pathogens\nExacerbations of COPD are triggered by viral infections in most cases when a pathogen is \nidentified (Table 13.1). However, in most cases of exacerbation of COPD, no pathogen is \nidentified (139,140) .\nTable 13.1 \u2013 Pathogens most frequently associated with exacerbations of chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease (in descending order of frequency)\nRespiratory viruses (most cases) Bacteria (less frequently)\nInfluenza virus (A and B)\nRespiratory syncytial virus\nParainfluenza virus\nRhinovirus\nCoronavirus (including SARS-CoV-2)\nOther respiratory virusesHaemophilus influenzae\nMoraxella catarrhalis\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\nGram-negative bacteria, including \nPseudomonas aeruginosa  (including \nmultidrug-resistant strains such as those \nproducing ESBL and carbapenemases)\nESBL: extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.166 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n13. Exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nClinical presentation\nAn exacerbation of COPD should be suspected in cases of recent and sustained worsening \nof dyspnoea and cough with increased sputum production compared with the baseline of \npatients with COPD, that is, chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Symptoms can overlap with \nthose of pneumonia; however, tachycardia, tachypnoea at rest and crepitations that persist \n(i.e. that do not clear) after coughing suggest pneumonia.\nThe decision to hospitalize a person with an exacerbation of COPD should be guided \nby the severity of symptoms, assessment of comorbidities and availability of home support.\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nWhen an exacerbation of COPD is suspected clinically, sputum Gram stain and culture are \nnot recommended routinely. In people with COPD, the respiratory tract may for example \nbe colonized with Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis  \nand Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and a positive culture may indicate colonization rather than \nacute infection.\nOther tests\nWhen exacerbations of COPD are suspected clinically, certain laboratory tests could be \nconsidered, in particular tests that can help identify patients with bacterial infections and \nthat can help assess the severity of the exacerbation. The rationale is that these patients \nwould benefit the most from antibiotic treatment. For example, C-reactive protein (141,142) , \nprocalcitonin, and complete blood count and blood gas analysis may be useful. However, \nthere is no clear consensus across guidelines about which tests should be performed \nroutinely in the hospital setting and such tests may not be available in many settings. \nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nRoutine surveillance of clinical isolates from patients presenting with exacerbations of COPD \nis not helpful to inform local or national prescribing guidance. \nImaging\nA chest X-ray could be considered in patients requiring hospitalization in order to exclude \nother diagnoses (e.g. pneumonia, pulmonary oedema) or in outpatients if pneumonia is \nsuspected and chest radiography is available. The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 167PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n13. Exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nNo antibiotic care\nThe core treatment of an exacerbation episode consists of supplementary oxygen and \nshort-acting inhaled beta-2-agonists (with or without anticholinergics). Most guidelines \ncurrently recommend using systemic steroids because they help improve lung function and \nshorten time to recovery. \nA detailed discussion of non-antibiotic management of COPD is beyond the scope \nof this chapter. Additional information can be found on the WHO website (132) .\nAntibiotic treatment\nMost exacerbations of COPD are not triggered by bacterial infections, therefore only certain \ncases will benefit from antibiotic treatment.\nNote\nAntibiotic treatment is not required in the great majority of cases of acute exacerbations of \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nAntibiotics are not needed for most cases. Their use could be considered in \nsevere exacerbations of COPD. Most guidelines suggest antibiotic treatment for patients \nhospitalized because of an acute exacerbation of COPD, especially if an increased volume \nand purulence of sputum is present, because these cases are more likely to be caused by \na bacterial infection. Severe exacerbations benefit more from antibiotic treatment (see \nTable 13.2 for antibiotic options). Current evidence suggests that the benefit in terms \nof reduced short-term mortality and reduced treatment failure is limited to hospitalized \npatients in intensive care units (143) . Previous colonization of the respiratory tract (e.g. \nwith Pseudomonas aeruginosa ) needs to be taken into account when choosing empiric \ntreatment. Patients with frequent episodes of COPD exacerbations may have received \nmultiple courses of antibiotic treatment during the year and have a higher risk of infections \ncaused by multidrug-resistant pathogens.168 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n13.

Acute infectious diarrhoea/gastroenteritis\nDefinition\nAcute diarrhoeal disease (also known as gastroenteritis) is a disease characterized by acute \nonset (usually defined as a duration of < 14 days) of diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is defined as the \npassage of unusually loose or watery stools occurring at least three times a day (or more \nfrequently than is normal for the individual). Consistency (how liquid/runny) rather than \nfrequency (how often) is the most important factor to consider and frequent passing of \nformed stool is not diarrhoea. In breastfed babies, frequent loose pale-coloured stools are \nnot considered diarrhoea (145) . Most cases of acute diarrhoea have an infectious origin, but \nnon-infectious causes are also possible, for example: adverse effects of medicines, including \nantibiotics and cytotoxic chemotherapy; endocrine diseases; inflammatory bowel diseases; \nand irritable bowel syndrome. Acute diarrhoea can be further subclassified as watery  \ndiarrhoea or bloody  diarrhoea (i.e. presence of visible blood in the stool).The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book171\nPRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n14.

Acute infectious diarrhoea/gastroenteritis\nPathophysiology\nAcute diarrhoeal diseases can be acquired through ingestion of food or water contaminated \nwith viral or bacterial pathogens (rarely protozoal or fungal pathogens) or through direct \ncontact with someone carrying the pathogen. Establishment of an enteric infection depends \non the capacity of the pathogen to invade the mucosa and overcome the host defences. It \nis dependent on several factors, including the inoculum, the virulence of the organism and \nthe status of host defences. Production of enterotoxins (i.e. bacterial proteins that act on the \nhost\u2019s intestinal cells) is a frequently encountered mechanism of disease.\nEpidemiology \nIn 2017, 6.2 billion episodes of diarrhoeal disease were estimated to have occurred \nworldwide, including 500 000 incident cases of intestinal/non-invasive/diarrhoeal non-\ntyphoidal Salmonella  disease (44).\nChildren younger than 5 years are often affected. About 1.7 billion cases of acute \ndiarrhoeal disease occur each year in this age group where it is an important cause of death \n(about 450 000 deaths in 2016). Acute malnutrition, living in or travelling to areas with \nlimited access to safe drinking-water and adequate sanitation are the leading risk factors for \nacute diarrhoeal diseases (146,151) . \nMost likely pathogens\nMost cases of community-acquired acute watery diarrhoeal disease have a viral origin. \nHowever, bacteria and parasites can also be causes (152) . For returning travellers, it is \nimportant to consider travel-associated diarrhoea. Table 14.1 and Table 14.2 give the \npathogens most frequently associated with acute diarrhoeal disease (in children and adults \nrespectively), and Table 14.3 the pathogens associated with chronic or persistent diarrhoea.176 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n14.

Nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain and \ncramping may also be present. In most cases, the disease is self-limiting. Since some \ncausative pathogens can be endemic in certain settings and absent in others, it is always \nimportant to consider where the patient became infected (including history of recent travel) \nand recent consumption of potentially unsafe food (e.g. raw meat or unpasteurized milk \nproducts). Recent antibiotic use (past 3 months), cytotoxic chemotherapy or the presence \nof immunosuppression (e.g. HIV infection) also need to be investigated. \nFive common clinical presentations can help identify cases that require specific \ntreatment and management (145) .\n1. Patients with watery diarrhoea . In these patients, the most likely cause is viral, \nmostly rotavirus and norovirus. A mild fever and vomiting may also occur. The \nmain risk is severe dehydration and management is symptomatic (e.g. fluid \nreplacement).\n2. Patients with bloody diarrhoea  (dysentery or invasive diarrhoea with damage \nto the intestinal mucosa). In these patients, the most likely cause are bacteria, \nmostly Shigella  spp., Campylobacter  spp., intestinal/non-invasive/diarrheal \nnon-typhoidal Salmonella  or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli . These cases may \nbenefit from antibiotic treatment. In addition to dehydration, these infections \ncan be complicated by sepsis and malnutrition. Entamoeba histolytica  can rarely \nalso cause bloody diarrhoea weeks or months after the infection; often these \ninfections are responsible for chronic rather than acute bloody diarrhoea. Other \nprotozoal parasites and very rarely Schistosoma  can also cause bloody diarrhoea; \nonly Schistosoma mansoni  and Schistosoma japonicum , the intestinal species.178 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n14. Acute infectious diarrhoea/gastroenteritis\n3. Patients with persistent diarrhoea  (symptoms lasting > 14 days). In these \npatients, a parasite is often implicated (e.g. Giardia intestinalis , Entamoeba \nhistolytica ) and the main risks are malnutrition and dehydration.\n4. Diarrhoea with severe malnutrition . In these patients, malnutrition is both a \ncause and consequence of diarrhoea.\n5. Diarrhoea with recent antibiotic exposure  (Clostridioides difficile ). This \ncondition is mostly hospital-acquired; please refer to the chapter on Clostridioides \ndifficile  infection if this is suspected.\nPatients may present with varying degrees of dehydration and this should be \npromptly assessed, especially in children and elderly people. In children, the degree of \ndehydration can be rated on a scale of three as indicated in Table 14.4 (146) .\nTable 14.4 \u2013 Classification of dehydration\nSeverity of dehydration Signs\nSevere dehydration: at least two signs \nfrom the list on the right must be \npresent\u2022 Lethargy and/or unconsciousness\n\u2022 Sunken eyes\n\u2022 Inability to drink \n\u2022 Skin pinch goes back very slowly (\u2265 2 seconds)\nSome dehydration: at least two signs \nfrom the list on the right must be \npresent\u2022 Restlessness, irritability\n\u2022 Sunken eyes\n\u2022 Drinks eagerly, is thirsty\nNo dehydration Too few signs to classify as some or severe \ndehydration\nSource: WHO Pocket book of hospital care for children (31).\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nRoutine stool testing is not needed since most cases are self-limiting and knowing the \ncausative agent would not alter management. Testing may be done for infection control \npurposes, if there is a high risk of spreading the disease in specific settings.\nHowever, in certain cases and based on local availability, a stool test (e.g. stool \nmicroscopy, stool culture, antigen testing and nucleic acid amplification tests) could be \nconsidered (Table 14.5), but only when identifying the causative pathogen may benefit the The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 179PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n14.

However, for severe cases, electrolytes \nshould be checked if available.\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nTargeted clinical microbiological surveys of cases of acute bloody diarrhoea in the primary \ncare setting in children and adults, specifically focusing on quinolone and macrolide \nresistance rates in Shigella  and intestinal/non-invasive/diarrhoeal non-typhoidal Salmonella , \nmay be helpful to inform local empiric antibiotic guidance. 180 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n14. Acute infectious diarrhoea/gastroenteritis\nImaging\nRoutine imaging is not needed for acute diarrhoeal disease.\nNo antibiotic care\nRehydration is the main treatment for acute diarrhoeal disease (oral or intravenous). In \nchildren, treating any diarrhoea with oral rehydration therapy using a low-osmolarity oral \nrehydration solution to prevent dehydration is recommended (145) . In addition, zinc tablets \n(10\u201320 mg/day) for 10\u201314 days are usually recommended to shorten the duration and \nseverity of symptoms (31,145) . \nIn adults, an oral rehydration solution is not usually needed, and fluid losses can be \ncompensated by drinking adequate fluids. However, in severely dehydrated adult patients, \nan oral rehydration solution can be given. Antidiarrhoeal and antiemetic medicines are not \nroutinely needed because they do not prevent dehydration and do not improve nutritional \nstatus (145) .\nAntibiotic treatment\nAntibiotics are not needed  in most cases of acute diarrhoeal disease because they are \nof viral origin and the illness is usually self-limiting regardless of the causative pathogen. \nRehydration is the main treatment for acute diarrhoeal disease (145) . Even in cases with \nsevere dehydration, antibiotic treatment is not routinely needed. \nHowever, in patients with significant acute bloody diarrhoea and in severely \nimmunocompromised patients, antibiotics may be given (see Table 14.6 for empiric \noptions based on the risk of fluoroquinolone resistance). Bloody diarrhoea could be \ncaused by certain strains of Escherichia coli  (Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli  also \nknown as enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli ). In these cases (mostly in children), the use \nof antibiotics is controversial because there is a theoretical concern that it could worsen \nsymptoms of haemolytic uraemic syndrome, characterized by haemolytic anaemia, \nrenal injury and low platelets.

Enteric fever\nPathogen\nEnteric fever is caused by Salmonella enterica  serotypes Typhi or Paratyphi A, B or C, a Gram-\nnegative bacterium. Non-typhoidal Salmonella  is not a cause of enteric fever but may cause \ninfectious gastroenteritis, bloodstream infections, meningitis or bone and joint infections. \nPlease refer to the relevant chapters if these infections are suspected. \nPathophysiology\nEnteric fever is acquired through ingestion of food or water contaminated with Salmonella  \nTyphi or Paratyphi or through direct contact with someone carrying the pathogen. Humans \nare the only source of these bacteria. Once the pathogen is ingested, it invades the intestinal \nmucosa primarily through the distal ileum. Once there, host immune defences are activated \nto eliminate the pathogen. However, these white cells can also act as carriers of the infection \nthrough the lymphatic system to the liver, spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes, and \nultimately to the bloodstream. Natural infection does not provide complete protection so \nrecurrent illness is possible (155) .\nEpidemiology \nMost cases of enteric fever are caused by Salmonella  Typhi (70\u201380% of cases). Even though \nthe absolute number of new cases of enteric fever has declined by 45% and the number \nof deaths by 41% since the 1990s, the disease is still endemic, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa \nand in South Asia. Based on available data, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are the countries \nwith the highest incidence of enteric fever with > 500 cases per 100 000 population in 2017. \nIn 2017, about 14.3 million cases of enteric fever occurred worldwide. In endemic countries, \nchildren are affected the most with almost 60% of cases occurring in children younger than \n15 years. Based on the data available, when appropriately treated with antibiotics, the case \nfatality rate for enteric fever is about 1% (156) . Complications (e.g. intestinal perforation) in \nhospitalized cases are estimated to occur in 20\u201330% of cases, with a higher risk in people \npresenting for care after having had symptoms for more than 10 days (157) .\nClinical presentation\nSymptoms of enteric fever are often non-specific, making it difficult to distinguish enteric \nfever from other febrile illnesses. As a result, misdiagnosis of cases can occur. In patients \nwith enteric fever, protracted fever (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C for more than 3 days) is the main symptom. \nHeadache is often present as well as loss of appetite and nausea. Gastrointestinal symptoms \nmay not be present, and diarrhoea is seen more frequently in children and in people with \nHIV. The clinical presentation can vary from mild illness with a low-grade fever and malaise \nto severe disease presenting with septic shock and peritonitis because of intestinal bleeding The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 189PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n15. Enteric fever\nand perforation. Encephalopathy can also occur in severe cases. Of note, clinical features are \nalso not useful to distinguish infections caused by Salmonella enterica  serotype Typhi from \nthose caused by Salmonella enterica  serotype Paratyphi.\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nIn patients with suspected enteric fever, the diagnosis is largely dependent on the clinical \npresentation and detection of the pathogen in blood cultures, even though the sensitivity is \nlow, especially when antibiotic treatment has already been started. A blood culture should \nbe taken in all possible cases with fever requiring hospitalization, ideally before \nstarting antibiotic treatment . Bone marrow cultures is the most sensitive diagnostic \nmethod, but these cultures are very rarely done because they are more difficult to perform \nand invasive. Stool cultures are usually negative in the early phases of the infection and \ntherefore they are of limited diagnostic use (Table 15.1). Widal serology is still widely used \nin low- and middle-income countries; however, it is not a reliable method to diagnose \nacute illness because a positive result may represent a previous infection, and in returning \ntravellers, vaccination prior to travel affects the results. Ideally the Widal serology requires \ntwo samples taken 10 days apart to demonstrate a four-fold rise of anti- Salmonella  Typhi \nantibodies and this is not practical in many low-resource settings. \nTable 15.1 \u2013 Microbiology tests to consider when enteric fever is suspected as \nindicated in the WHO EDL (6)\nDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Setting where the test \nshould be available\nBlood culturesa \nand antimicrobial \nsusceptibility testingTo detect bacterial and fungal bloodstream \ninfections (sepsis)Health care facilities \nwith clinical \nlaboratories\nBone marrow cultureb \nand antimicrobial \nsusceptibility testingInitial step in detection and identification of \nbacterial and fungal species for selection of \nappropriate antimicrobial regimensHealth care facilities \nwith clinical \nlaboratories\nStool culturec \nand antimicrobial \nsusceptibility testingInitial step in detection and identification \nof bacterial species for selection of \nappropriate antibiotic regimensHealth care facilities \nwith clinical \nlaboratories\nEDL: Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics.\na Often the mainstay of diagnosis.

Enteric fever\nOther tests\nRoutine laboratory testing is not always needed but could be considered in severe cases (i.e. \nroutine haematology and biochemistry).\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nTargeted clinical microbiological surveys of enteric fever-related bloodstream infection \nfocusing on Salmonella enterica  serotype Typhi and Paratyphi resistance rates may help \ninform local and national empiric antibiotic guidance. \nImaging\nRoutine imaging is not needed.\nAntibiotic treatment\nAntibiotic treatment options are shown in Table 15.2. In cases of enteric fever, antibiotic \ntreatment should be started promptly because delays are associated with higher risk of \ncomplications and severe disease. In general, antibiotic treatment is given to shorten the \nduration of symptoms and to reduce the risk of complications, such as intestinal perforation \nand chronic carriage. Chronic carriers are asymptomatic people who continue to harbour \nthe pathogen for months or even years after their initial infection and can transmit the \ninfection. Fever usually decreases slowly, after around 3\u20135 days of effective treatment. \nMild cases can be treated as outpatients with oral treatment, while severe cases should be \ntreated as inpatients with systemic intravenous treatment. \nThe choice of oral antibiotic, if possible, should be based on the sensitivity \nof the isolated pathogen. When choosing empiric treatment, the local prevalence of \nfluoroquinolone resistance should be considered because of the increasing number of \nresistant isolates, mostly in Asia (158) . In these settings, a third-generation cephalosporin \nor azithromycin are appropriate options because resistance to these antibiotics is still \nlow in most settings; < 5% for ceftriaxone and only sporadic cases with resistance to \nazithromycin. Of note, antibiotics that were widely used in the 1980s and 1990s but fell \ninto disuse because of resistance or toxicity concerns (e.g. ampicillin, chloramphenicol \nand sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim) are again effective in some settings, mostly in Asia. \nHowever, the empiric use of these older options for treatment is discouraged because it \ncould prompt a rebound of multidrug-resistant organisms. \nIn recent years, outbreaks of enteric fever caused by extensively antibiotic-resistant \nSalmonella  Typhi have been reported, for example, in Pakistan since 2016 (159) . These extensively \nantibiotic-resistant isolates are resistant to ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim, \nchloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins and represent a public \nhealth threat including the risk of travel/migration-related spread to other countries and regions.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 191PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n15.

Enteric fever\nd In settings where ceftriaxone-resistance is increasing, azithromycin should be prioritized. Outbreaks of enteric \nfever caused by extensively antibiotic-resistant Salmonella  Typhi have been reported, for example, in Pakistan since \n2016 (159)  and in travel-related cases across the world (162\u2013164) . In general, when ceftriaxone is used, changing \nto oral treatment could be considered when there is symptomatic improvement. If available, the choice of oral \noptions to use could be guided by results of susceptibility testing, including the possibility of using certain first-\nchoice options that were used in the past.\nLegend: ACCESS antibiotics are indicated in green, WATCH antibiotics in orange and RESERVE antibiotics in red.\nCombination treatment\nCurrently, a single antibiotic regimen is recommended. However, the combination of a third-\ngeneration cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) and azithromycin has been reported to reduce the \nduration of symptoms. This approach is suggested in some guidelines for severe cases (160,161) .\nPrevention\nAccess to safe water and adequate sanitation, health education, appropriate hygiene among \nfood handlers and typhoid vaccination are all effective strategies for prevention and control \nof enteric fever. For updated information on vaccines to prevent enteric fever, please refer to \nthe 2018 WHO position paper on typhoid vaccines (154) . Vaccination should be prioritized \nin countries with the highest burden of enteric fever (especially where antibiotic resistance \nis high) and in response to confirmed outbreaks. Single-dose typhoid conjugated vaccines \nare also available that can be used in younger children (from the age of 6 months onwards) \nand confer prolonged duration of protection.

Skin and soft tissue infections \u2013 mild bacterial impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis\nof deep subcutaneous tissue and/or severity of disease (complicated or uncomplicated). \nFurther classifications are based on the origin of the infection (bites, burns; see corresponding \nchapters) or host characteristics (e.g. immunosuppression, diabetes).\nA more recent definition by the United States Food and Drug Administration uses \nthe term acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) to include a subset \nof conditions such as cellulitis and erysipelas, wound infections and major cutaneous \nabscesses, provided the area of the skin surface affected is at least 75 cm2. This definition \nwas introduced \u201cto assist sponsors developing drugs for the treatment of skin infections\u201d \nand has limited clinical applicability outside trials (165) .\nThis chapter focuses on the mild superficial forms of skin infections that do not affect \ndeeper tissue layers: impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis. For the more severe forms of skin \nand soft tissue infections, please refer to the corresponding chapters: necrotizing fasciitis, \npyomyositis, burn wounds and severe infections with sepsis.

Skin and soft tissue infections \u2013 mild bacterial impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis\nPathophysiology\nDamage of the skin can lead to infections of the deeper layers beneath the epidermis. When \nsuch damage occurs, both endogenous pathogens (i.e. that naturally reside in the body) \nand exogenous pathogens (i.e. that enter the body from the environment) can penetrate \nthe epidermis and spread to deeper structures through the lymphatic system. Depending \non the depth of the infection, different clinical diseases can occur: impetigo and erysipelas \n(infections of the upper layer of the skin) and cellulitis (infection of the deep dermis and \nsubcutaneous tissue) (Figure 16.1). Cellulitis of the face can also occur as a consequence \nof local spreading of a dental infection, for example, dental abscess spreading to the \nsurrounding soft tissue can result in cellulitis.\nFigure 16.1 \u2013 Anatomy of the skin and locations of common infections\nEpidermis\nDermis\nSubcutaneous tissu e\nMuscleFasciaCellulitis,\nLymphangitis\nNecr otizing\nfasciitisImpetigo ,\nErysipelasDept h of in fectio n Skin la yers\nEpidemiology\nBacterial skin infections occur worldwide and can affect all age groups; erysipelas is more \nfrequent in children and elderly patients. In 2013, skin diseases (not limited to bacterial \ninfections) were the fourth leading cause of non-fatal diseases (166) . Cellulitis, the most \ncommon skin infection, accounted for 0.04% (4 in 10 000) of the overall burden of all \ndiseases combined in 2013. It was the only skin condition that showed a significant \ndecrease (\u201313.2%) between 2005 and 2013 in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a proxy \nfor morbidity and mortality. This decrease was attributed to reduced mortality (166) . In 2017, \nthe Global Burden of Disease study reported 43 million new cases of cellulitis worldwide (44). \nDiabetes, peripheral arterial disease, HIV infection and other causes of immunosuppression \nare risk factors for severe skin infections.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 199PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n16.

In a minority of cases \n(mostly in young children), vesicles develop to form larger bullae (bullous form).\nFigure 16.3 \u2013 Case of impetigo on the chin\nSource:\u00a9 James Heilman, MD, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia CommonsThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 201PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n16. Skin and soft tissue infections \u2013 mild bacterial impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis\nErysipelas\nErysipelas is characterized by acute onset of a red skin lesion with well defined indurated \nmargins, usually on the face or legs (Figure 16.4). Bullae may be present or develop in the \nfirst few days. The lesion is usually painful. Fever (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C) and other signs of systemic \ninfection (e.g. tachycardia, leukocytosis) may be present.\nFigure 16.4 \u2013 Case of erysipelas on the cheek\nSource: CDC Public Health Image Library/Dr Thomas F. Sellers, Emory University\nCellulitis\nWhile erysipelas affects only the superficial skin layers and has clearly demarcated borders, \ncellulitis also affects subcutaneous tissues. Cellulitis is characterized by an acute onset of \na skin lesion presenting with a combination of redness, swelling and induration, warmth \nand pain (or tenderness) of the affected area (see Figure 16.5). The condition can occur \nanywhere on the body, but predominantly affects the skin of the lower part of the legs and \nfeet or the face. \nIn patients with cellulitis, fever (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C) and other signs of systemic infection (e.g. \ntachycardia, leukocytosis) may be present. Skin redness alone may not indicate an infection, \nfor example, redness is often present in patients with chronic venous stasis \u2013 bilateral versus \nunilateral involvement may indicate a non-infectious etiology, although bilateral cellulitis \ncan occasionally occur. The severity of the infection should always be carefully assessed, \nespecially to exclude the possibility of involvement of the muscular fascia (fasciitis). Facial \nand neck cellulitis, commonly arising from dental infection, can lead to potentially fatal \ndeep space infections such as Ludwig angina. Cellulitis of the face can spread to the brain 202 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n16.

These are medical \nemergencies but are overall rare.\nFigure 16.5 \u2013 Case of cellulitis in the lower leg\nSource: John Campbell, CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0), via Flickr\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nMost mild cases of impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis do not require routine microbiology \ntests. Surface swabs of intact, unbroken skin should not be taken in cases of erysipelas \nor cellulitis to avoid detecting pathogens that colonize the skin leading to unnecessary \nantibiotic treatment.\nTissue swab cultures can be considered in certain cases (Table 16.3). For example, \ncultures could be done for lesions that are clearly purulent (therefore most likely due \nto Staphylococcus aureus ) to diagnose or exclude the presence of methicillin-resistant \nStaphylococcus aureus  (MRSA). However, in many settings doing tissue swab cultures is not \nstandard practice outside of the operating theatre. When swabs are taken, the lesion should \nalways be cleaned and debrided before sample collection to identify the pathogens causing \nthe infection and not colonizing organisms. For a correct interpretation of cultures, it is very \nimportant that the origin of the culture (exact location, superficial swab or intraoperatively \nobtained culture) is adequately documented.\nCultures can be considered for chronic lesions such as diabetic foot infections \n(not covered in this chapter) to exclude the presence of multidrug-resistant organisms, for \nexample, those producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs).The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 203PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n16.

However, \ninitial imaging (e.g. ultrasound, X-ray) may be considered if an abscess or subdermal involvement \nare suspected. In these cases, management often requires a surgical approach, for example, \nincision and drainage in case of abscess and management of the primary dental cause.\nTopical treatment (only for localized non-bullous \nimpetigo)\nFor localized non-bullous impetigo, topical treatment could be considered as an alternative \nto oral antibiotics. This treatment can be as effective as oral antibiotic treatment and has the \nadvantage that the risk of adverse events is minimal because of less systemic absorption (168) . \nOf the different topical treatments available, mupirocin ointment (2%) could be \nconsidered for a short course of treatment (5 days). However, widespread use of mupirocin \ncan rapidly increase resistance to mupirocin in Staphylococcus aureus  and limit its usefulness \nfor targeted preventive purposes in carriers of Staphylococcus aureus ; mupirocin is active \nagainst both methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus  and MRSA. Alternative treatments \nare available but they are not included in the EML and EMLc (8,9) . These alternatives are \nfusidic acid and hydrogen peroxide cream (1%). Topical corticosteroids should not be used \nroutinely in these cases.204 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n16. Skin and soft tissue infections \u2013 mild bacterial impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis\nAntibiotic treatment (for widespread impetigo, \nerysipelas and cellulitis)\nIn most cases of mild infections, oral antibiotic treatment is adequate (Table 16.4). Empiric \nantibiotic options need to have good activity against the most likely pathogens ( Streptococcus  \nspp. and Staphylococcus aureus ). Empiric treatment against community-acquired MRSA may \nbe considered in certain cases (e.g. clearly purulent lesions) based on individual risk factors \n(e.g. known MRSA colonization) and on the local prevalence of community-acquired MRSA. \nIn these cases, the literature suggests using clindamycin or sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim; \nthese options are however not currently listed in the EML and EMLc for this indication.\nTable 16.4 \u2013 Empiric antibiotic treatment for mild skin infections\nImportant\nWhere more than one antibiotic is recommended for an infection, they are listed in alphabetical \norder and they should be considered equal treatment options, unless otherwise indicated.\nNote\nCloxacillin and cefalexin have a narrower spectrum of antibacterial activity compared to \namoxicillin+clavulanic acid with good efficacy in mild skin and soft tissue infections.

Burn wound-related infections\nPathophysiology \nBurns predispose to infection because they allow entry of pathogens from the patient\u2019s \nown skin microbiota and the environment into the wound. Burns can also cause \nimmunosuppression that allows rapid bacterial colonization and proliferation. Sepsis and \nseptic shock are a frequent complication of severe burns.\nEpidemiology\nBurn wounds are an important public health problem in low- and middle-income countries \nwhere they are among the leading causes of DALYs lost. An estimated 180 000 deaths \nevery year are caused by burns and most occur in low- and middle-income countries \n(170) . Infections (including but not limited to the skin) are the most frequent complications \nencountered in patients with burn injuries and are the leading cause of death in patients \nwith severe wounds. Skin infections (e.g. cellulitis) are in general the first infections to occur, \nusually in the first week of the injury.\nMost likely pathogens\nTable 17.1 gives the pathogens that often infect burn wounds. In most cases, infection is \ncaused by several pathogens. Multidrug-resistant organisms are a major concern in burn \npatients often because of prolonged hospitalization and frequent antibiotic exposure (171) . \nTable 17.1 \u2013 Pathogens most frequently associated with infected burn wounds (in \ndescending order of frequency)\nTime infection acquired Bacteria Fungi\nSoon after the injury Streptococcus  spp. \nStaphylococcus aureus  (including \nMRSA)\nStaphylococcus  spp. other than \nStaphylococcus aureus\nEnterobacterales (including \nmultidrug-resistant strains such \nas those producing ESBL and \ncarbapenemases)Infrequent\ncontinuesThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 211PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n17.

For this reason, burn \nwounds should be monitored for signs of infection, such as increased pain and redness or \nswelling of the area surrounding the wound. Redness alone may represent inflammation \nand does not necessarily indicate infection. Signs of invasive infection (e.g. change in the \ncolour of the wound, signs of sepsis) should also be carefully monitored. Please also refer \nto the chapter on sepsis if suspected. Patients with burn injuries may also develop other \ncomplications dependent on their supportive care such as pneumonia, UTIs or catheter-\nrelated infections. \nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nIn mild cases of infection of a burn wound where there are no signs of systemic infection, \nroutine testing (including wound cultures) is not required. These tests are not needed \nbecause identifying the causative pathogen in mild cases will not benefit the patient as it \nwill not change management. In severe cases, blood cultures can be considered. Please also \nrefer to the chapter on sepsis if suspected.\nOther tests\nRoutine testing in mild cases with no signs of systemic infection is not required. In addition, \nbecause of the inflammatory response associated with the burn itself, results of laboratory \ntests (e.g. biomarkers of infection) may be of limited help.\nIn severe cases, certain laboratory tests can be considered to make an initial \nassessment of the patient and to help guide the duration of antibiotic treatment. Please also \nrefer to the chapter on sepsis if suspected.212 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n17. Burn wound-related infections\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nTargeted clinical surveys of bloodstream infection isolates at a local unit level may be helpful \nto inform empiric guidance. Empiric guidance should not usually be informed by routine \nsurface skin swabs.\nImaging\nRoutine imaging is not required unless a complication is suspected.\nManagement\nIrrigation and debridement of necrotic tissue to prevent infection of the burn wound is suggested. \nAppropriate daily cleaning and dressing of the wound are the cornerstone of treatment.\nInfection control procedures should be meticulously observed to prevent \ntransmission of multidrug-resistant organisms.\nTopical treatment\nLocal antiseptics could be considered based on local protocols.\nPreventive antibiotic use \nRoutine use of antibiotics to prevent infection in burn wounds should be avoided if there \nare no signs of systemic infection or in otherwise healthy patients. Use of antibiotics as \na preventive treatment is controversial because there is no clear evidence that it can \nprevent infection (172,173) . In addition, such use can lead to colonization with resistant \nmicroorganisms, so caution is needed. \nAntibiotic treatment\nEmpiric treatment of mild infections should include antibiotics with good activity against \nthe most likely pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus  and Streptococcus  spp. Antibiotic options \nare shown in Table 17.2. Empiric treatment against community-acquired MRSA may be \nconsidered and should be based on local prevalence of invasive isolates and individual \npatient risk factors (e.g. known MRSA colonization). \nIt is important to note that because hospital-acquired multidrug-resistant organisms are \nfrequently found in burn units, the results of microbiology cultures should where possible \nguide antibiotic treatment. Empiric use of RESERVE group antibiotics should, however, \ngenerally be avoided unless there is a high suspicion of the infection being caused by \nmultidrug-resistant organisms.

Wound and bite-related infections\nPathophysiology\nSkin wounds predispose to infection because they facilitate entry of pathogens from the \npatient\u2019s own skin microbiota and the environment into the wound. With bites, pathogens \nfrom the oral cavity of the biting animal can also penetrate the skin.\nEpidemiology\nTraumatic wounds\nRoad traffic injuries occur worldwide but the majority of deaths (> 90%) occur in low- and \nmiddle-income countries. Overall each year about 1.3 million people die as a result of road \ntraffic incidents with many more suffering from non-fatal injuries (between 20 and 50 million \npeople) (177,182) . In people younger than 30 years, this is the leading cause of death. \nIn 2016, the Global Burden of Disease study reported about 251 000 deaths from \nfirearm injuries globally (outside of war settings), the majority caused by homicides (64%), \nfollowed by suicides (27%) and unintentional firearm deaths (9%). Overall, the global age-\nstandardized rate of firearm deaths decreased by about 0.9% a year between 1990 and 2016 \nwith differences between countries. Most firearm injury deaths occur among people aged \n20 to 24 years (183) .\nBite wounds\nHuman and animal bites occur worldwide; most cases are caused by animals (dogs in > 90% \nof cases) (184) . Less frequently, bites are caused by other mammals such as cats, rodents \n(e.g. rats, mice) and bats. In certain countries (e.g. in Africa and in South-East Asia), snake \nand monkey bites are also frequently reported. Children are more likely to have animal bites \n(185) . The risk of developing a bacterial infection from a dog bite is unclear and depends on \nmany different factors related to the patient (i.e. the person bitten), the characteristics of \nthe bite (depth, location) and the initial management of the bite. However, available data \nsuggest that in 10\u201320% of cases of dog bites, the wound will become infected (185,186) . \nIn comparison, wounds caused by cat bites have a higher risk of becoming infected (up to \n50%) because of the deeper penetration of their teeth (185,186) .\nAnimal bites are a significant risk factor for transmission of rabies, especially in \nsettings where prophylaxis with rabies vaccine in domestic and wild animals is not routinely \ngiven. The Global Burden of Disease study estimated 13 400 new cases of rabies worldwide \nin 2017 (44). Deaths from rabies and dog bites are a problem mostly in low- and middle-\nincome countries where post-exposure treatment and appropriate access to health care \nmay be lacking (184) . 222 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n18. Wound and bite-related infections\nSmall rodents are vectors of numerous pathogens and are a reservoir for many \nzoonotic diseases. Rodents (mostly rats) are also responsible for an appreciable proportion \nof bites to humans (187) . Rat bites primarily affect people (mostly children < 5 years) living \nin poorer conditions in rat-infested environments, including in high-income countries. Most \nbites occur on the face and hands and usually occur at night while sleeping. Although \nrare, rat bites can cause severe infections, such as rat-bite fever, caused by Streptobacillus \nmoniliformis  or Spirillum minus . Tetanus infection can also be caused by bites and it should \nbe considered in patients who have not been immunized against the infection. In 2019, \nalmost 15 000 cases of tetanus were reported globally (188) .\nMost likely pathogens\nTraumatic wounds\nIn most cases, infections from traumatic wounds are polymicrobial with a mix of human skin \nmicrobiota and environmental organisms (Table 18.1).\nTable 18.1 \u2013 Pathogens most frequently associated with traumatic skin wounds (in \ndescending order of frequency), except bites, see Table 18.2\nMost casesaMore rarely \nStreptococcus  spp.\nStaphylococcus aureus  (including \nMRSA)Anaerobes\nEnterobacterales \nEnterococcus  spp.\nClostridium tetani  (soil contaminant)\nMRSA: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus .\na Mostly Gram-positive pathogens from the skin microbiota.\nBite wounds\nIn infections from bites, causative pathogens may also be from the animal/human oral \nmicrobiota with differences among species (Table 18.2) (187) .The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 223PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n18.

Wound and bite-related infections\nClinical presentation (only mild cases are covered)\nWounds range in severity from minor superficial abrasions to deep wounds with \ninvolvement and destruction of the deep tissues. An infection may or may not be present at \nthe time of clinical evaluation. Usually, signs and symptoms of infection appear > 12 hours \nafter the injury. Superficial infections may manifest with signs and symptoms of cellulitis \ncharacterized by redness, swelling, warmth, lymphangitis and pain of the area surrounding \nthe wound. Fever (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C) may be present. Patients should also be carefully monitored \nfor signs of invasive infection, for example, change in colour of the wound due to necrosis \nand signs of sepsis.\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nIn mild cases with no signs of systemic infection, routine testing, including wound cultures, is \nnot required. These tests are not needed because identifying the causative pathogen in mild \ncases is rare even when microbiology tests are performed, most infections are polymicrobial \nand microbiology results will not affect management of the condition in most cases. \nOther tests\nRoutine testing in mild cases with no signs of systemic infection is not required.\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nRoutine surveillance is not helpful in informing empiric guidance. \nImaging\nRoutine imaging is not required. Imaging may be considered in certain cases based on the \nsize and depth of the wound, particularly if a complication, such as development of an \nabscess or necrotizing infection, is suspected.\nNo antibiotic care\nInitial management of wounds\nIt is important to provide rapid and appropriate treatment of a wound after an injury has \noccurred to minimize the risk of infection. For prevention and management of wound \ninfections, please refer to the 2013 WHO guidance publication (174) .226 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n18. Wound and bite-related infections\nAdequate cleaning and debridement are the cornerstone of initial treatment. It \nis important to thoroughly wash and flush the wound for about 15 minutes with soap \nor detergent and a lot of clean water, followed by debridement and immobilization of \nthe wound. \nPost-exposure prophylaxis\nTraumatic wounds\nAfter any wound, the risk of tetanus needs to be promptly evaluated to provide adequate \npost-exposure prophylaxis by vaccination with or without passive immunization using \ntetanus immunoglobulin when needed according to local/international recommendations.\nFor tetanus post-exposure prophylaxis, please refer to the WHO tetanus vaccines \nposition paper (178) . \nBite wounds\nWith animal bites, in addition to the risk of tetanus, the risk of rabies needs also to be rapidly \nevaluated based on the exposure category to provide adequate post-exposure prophylaxis \nwhen needed (Table 18.3). \nFor rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, please refer to the WHO rabies vaccines \nposition paper (179) .\nWith human bites, the risk of hepatitis B and C virus and HIV transmission also needs \nto be evaluated and post-exposure prophylaxis offered when applicable (180,181) . \nTable 18.3 \u2013 Risk of rabies exposure according to the type of contact with the \nanimal suspected of having rabies (179)\nCategoryaType of contact Risk of exposure\nI Touching or feeding animals, animal licks on intact skin No exposure\nII Nibbling of uncovered skin, minor scratches or \nabrasions without bleedingExposure\nIII Single or multiple transdermal bites or scratches, \ncontamination of mucous membrane or broken skin \nwith saliva from animal licks, exposures due to direct \ncontact with batsSevere exposure\na The category of exposure determines the indicated post-exposure prophylaxis procedure.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 227PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n18. Wound and bite-related infections\nPreventive antibiotic use \nRoutine use of antibiotics to prevent infection of the wound is not required in most cases \n(unless there are systemic signs of infection in which case antibiotics would be used as \ntreatment and not as prophylaxis) and should be discouraged. \nPreventive antibiotic use may be considered in very few specific cases where the \npotential risk of infection is judged to outweigh the risk of overusing antibiotics. \nThese cases include:\n\u2022 Wounds in high-risk clinical areas (e.g. face, hands, areas near a joint)\n\u2022 Severely immunocompromised patients.\nHowever, there is no clear evidence that use of antibiotics can prevent infection after \na wound has occurred, including bite wounds. In addition, such use exposes the patient to \nthe negative effects of antibiotics, for example, alteration of the intestinal microbiota, and \nselection of resistant microorganisms. \nAntibiotic treatment\nIf signs and symptoms of infection are present, empiric treatment should include antibiotics \nwith good activity against the most likely pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus  and Streptococcus  \nspp. and anaerobic organisms. With animal bites, the type of animal should also be considered \n(see Table 18.2), but in general, empiric treatment against both aerobic and anaerobic \nbacteria is required, since most infections are caused by multiple pathogens (polymicrobial \ninfections). Empiric treatment against community-acquired MRSA is usually not required. If \ncellulitis around the wound develops, refer to the chapter on bacterial impetigo, erysipelas \nand cellulitis. Antibiotic options for empiric treatment are given in Table 18.4.\nNote\nOnly infected wounds should be treated with antibiotics.228 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n18.

Sexually transmitted infections \u2013 chlamydial urogenital infection\nPathogen\nChlamydial urogenital infection is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , an intracellular \nGram-negative bacterium. There are several strains of Chlamydia trachomatis  and not all \nare associated with STI (see the chapter on trachoma). Chlamydial urogenital infections \nassociated with STI are caused mostly by genital tract biovars (serovars D to K) and, more rarely, \nlymphogranuloma venereum biovar (serovars L1, L2, L3). Lymphogranuloma venereum is \nan ulcerative disease extending to regional lymph nodes (often the inguinal and anorectal \narea) and is more common in men (see the paragraph on lymphogranuloma venereum later \nin this chapter). This disease is endemic in many tropical and sub-tropical regions; in other \nsettings, the infection is most commonly seen among men who have sex with men.\nPathophysiology\nChlamydia trachomatis  infects the mucosa of the urogenital tract during sexual contact \nand produces a local inflammatory response that causes vaginal, urethral or anal discharge. \nInvasive infections caused by more invasive serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis  can also \nspread to regional lymph nodes.\nEpidemiology\nChlamydial urogenital infection is one of the most common STIs worldwide, including in \nlow-income settings where it is probably under-reported (194,195) . Young sexually active \nadults are at particularly high risk. Undiagnosed and untreated, chlamydial urogenital \ninfections can lead to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (infection of the \nupper female reproductive tract), ectopic pregnancy and infertility in women (196,197) . \nMaternal infection can cause serious health problems to the child, such as preterm birth, low \nbirth weight or conjunctivitis. The 2021 WHO global progress report on HIV, viral hepatitis \nand STIs reported an estimated 128 million new chlamydial infections in 2020 among adults \naged 15 to 49 years (193) .\nClinical presentation\nSigns and symptoms of chlamydial infection mostly overlap with those of gonococcal infection.\nIn most cases, the infection is asymptomatic, and it is therefore impossible to determine how \nlong a person has been infected. Even in the absence of symptoms, infected individuals can \ntransmit the infection.\nWhen symptoms occur (usually 1\u20132 weeks after being infected), particularly in men, the \nmost common clinical presentation is acute urethritis characterized by profuse usually \nclear urethral discharge and dysuria. Most women with chlamydial cervical infection are  234 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n19. Sexually transmitted infections \u2013 chlamydial urogenital infection\nasymptomatic. The ones who may be symptomatic have vaginal discharge, dyspareunia \n(painful intercourse) and dysuria. Some women may have lower abdominal pain or pelvic \ntenderness because of ascending infection, causing pelvic inflammatory disease.\nIn both sexes (but in males more than females), symptoms of acute proctitis with pain, pruritus, \ndischarge and bleeding of the rectum may occur. Pharyngitis (mostly manifesting as a mild \nsore throat) and conjunctivitis are other conditions that usually coexist with genital infection.\nLymphogranuloma venereum  is characterized by inguinal or femoral lymphadenopathy \n(usually unilateral) with or without an associated primary lesion. The classic lesion is a \ntransient, ulcerative lesion or a papule usually located on the genitalia or rectum. In many \ncases, the lesion may remain unnoticed; for example, the infection may be completely \nasymptomatic in women when located on the cervix or can sometimes present with \nsymptoms of acute urethritis in men. Rectal exposure can cause proctitis with pain, pruritus, \ndischarge and bleeding of the rectum.\nLaboratory tests\nPatient microbiology tests\nMolecular testing has greatly improved the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis  (and \nNeisseria gonorrhoeae ) among both symptomatic and asymptomatic men and women. \nMolecular testing has become the recommended reference standard technology to \ndiagnose and screen populations for Chlamydia trachomatis  and Neisseria gonorrhoeae . \nTable 19.1 indicates the types of specimens that can be used for this purpose.\nFor more comprehensive information on the diagnosis of chlamydial infection, please refer \nto the most recent (2013) WHO guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of STIs (192) . Please \ncheck the WHO website regularly for possible updates.\nPatients with chlamydial urogenital infection should be offered testing for HIV and other \nSTIs, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, gonococcal infection and syphilis. Test of cure (i.e. \ntesting after the end of treatment) could be considered in pregnant women 3\u20134 weeks \nafter the end of treatment.\nTests to consider when chlamydial infection is suspected are listed in Table 19.1. Additional \ntests for other STIs that could be considered when chlamydial urogenital infection is \nconfirmed or suspected are shown in Table 19.2. Surveillance, including etiologic studies of \nSTI syndromes, will be important to inform local and national guidance. \nIf symptoms persist at review, partner notification and treatment history should be checked. \nPeople with recurrent or persistent infection should be referred to a centre with laboratory \ncapacity to diagnose Neisseria gonorrhoeae , Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma genitalium  \nand Trichomonas vaginalis  and to test for antibiotic-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae  and \nMycoplasma genitalium .The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 235PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n19.

An endocervical \nswab can also be an alternative but requires a speculum. First-catch urine is another option, but the sensitivity and \nspecificity tend to be lower in women. Among men, possible specimens are first-catch urine or urethral swabs. \nAnorectal and pharyngeal samples are also adequate. For anorectal samples among men who have sex with men, \nChlamydia  genovar testing for lymphogranuloma venereum should be done to guide the appropriate treatment \nregimen for this condition.\nc Possible specimens are urethral swabs, endocervical swabs, vaginal swabs, rectal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs \nand conjunctival swabs. Note. Urine samples are not good specimens for microscopy and culture.\nd Consider culture if symptoms persist despite adequate treatment: note, urine samples are not good specimens \nfor culture. Processing Chlamydia trachomatis  for culture requires highly experienced laboratories and technicians \nand is too complex, laborious and time-consuming to be of economic value. It is rarely performed in middle- or \nhigh-income countries nowadays except for special purposes.236 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n19.

Sexually transmitted infections \u2013 gonococcal infection\nDefinition\nGonococcal infection is an STI caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae .\nPathogen\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae , the organism causing gonorrhoea, is a Gram-negative bacterium.\nThe bacterium easily develops resistance to antibiotics, which has led to infections that \nare difficult to treat. As a result, resistance to antibiotics used for treatment (including third-\ngeneration cephalosporins) is a serious problem worldwide. Therefore, in 2012, WHO launched a \nglobal action plan to control the spread and impact of resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae  (201) .\nData on Neisseria gonorrhoeae  resistance are collected through the WHO Global \nAntimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) and the WHO Global Gonococcal \nAntimicrobial Surveillance Programme (GASP network) and are regularly published (202\u2013205) . \nPathophysiology\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae  usually enters the mucosa (mostly of the genital tract) during \nsexual contact. Because of its many virulence factors, this bacterium can adapt to the \nlocal environment, evade immune response mechanisms and proliferate causing local \ninflammatory response and disease and, more rarely, systemic infection (i.e. gonococcal \nbacteraemia). If left untreated, or if it is inappropriately treated, complications may occur. \nIn particular in women, pelvic inflammatory disease (i.e. an infection of the upper female \nreproductive tract) with inflammation of the uterine tubes (i.e. salpingitis), endometrium \n(i.e. endometritis) or abscess formation in the ovary/ovaries and tubes can occur. In men, \ncomplications include epididymitis and periurethritis with abscess formation. These \ncomplications can lead to infertility. \nDisseminated gonococcal infection can occur as a result of bacteraemia secondary \nto mucosal infection (mostly of the genital tract) and can lead to arthritis, skin manifestations \nand other complications.\nInfants of mothers with gonococcal infection can be infected at delivery, resulting \nin neonatal conjunctivitis which manifests as purulent ocular discharge and swollen eyelids. \nUntreated conjunctivitis may lead to scarring and blindness.\nEpidemiology\nGonococcal infection is one of the most common STIs worldwide. \nThe 2021 WHO global progress report on HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs reported an \nestimated 82 million new gonococcal infections in 2020 among adults aged 15 to 49 years (193) .246 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n20. Sexually transmitted infections \u2013 gonococcal infection\nThe highest incidence of gonococcal infection is in the Africa and Western Pacific \nregions; this includes China and Australia among others (206) . Gonococcal infection \nincreases the risk of HIV infection two- or three-fold.\nRisk factors for gonococcal infection include HIV infection, young age, having \nmultiple sexual partners or a new sexual partner, having partners with STIs, having had \nprevious gonococcal infection and/or other STIs and several socioeconomic factors, such \nas low socioeconomic or educational level or substance abuse. Infection does not induce \nprotective immunity therefore reinfection is possible. Resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae  \nto antibiotics used to treat the infection is a concern; see the pathogen section for more \ninformation about resistance (204) .\nClinical presentation\nSigns and symptoms of gonococcal infection vary in men and women and overlap with \nthose of chlamydial infection. Some people with gonococcal infection may be asymptomatic \neven though they can still transmit the infection. When symptoms occur (usually a few days \nafter being infected), the most common clinical presentation in men is acute urethritis \ncharacterized by profuse mucopurulent urethral discharge and dysuria; testicular discomfort \ncan also be present. In women, mucopurulent vaginal discharge and dysuria are the most \ncommon symptoms. Several women may have lower abdominal pain because of ascending \ninfection causing pelvic inflammatory disease. Gonorrhoea causes cervical infection that \npresents with cervical discharge, cervical ectopy and friability and easy bleeding on contact. \nIn both sexes (but in males more than females), symptoms of acute proctitis with pain, \npruritus, discharge and bleeding of the rectum may occur. Pharyngitis (mostly manifesting as a \nmild sore throat) and conjunctivitis are other conditions that usually coexist with genital infection.\nRarely, the infection can disseminate (i.e. gonococcal bacteraemia) and this can \ntypically lead to localized infection in one or more joints (i.e. gonococcal arthritis). Please \nrefer to the chapter on septic arthritis for more information on this topic.\nIn pregnant women, the infection can be transmitted to the child during vaginal \ndelivery. In newborns, gonococcal infection can present with acute ocular infection (i.e. \nconjunctivitis) or pharyngitis which manifest a few days after birth. Disseminated infection \nwith septic arthritis (usually with multiple joints involved) can also occur in newborns.\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nMolecular testing has greatly improved the detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae  and \nChlamydia trachomatis  among both symptomatic and asymptomatic men and women. \nMolecular testing has become the recommended gold standard technology to diagnose  The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 247PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n20. Sexually transmitted infections \u2013 gonococcal infection\nand screen populations for Neisseria gonorrhoeae  and Chlamydia trachomatis . Table 20.1 \nindicates the types of specimens that can be used for this purpose.\nCulture of Neisseria gonorrhoeae  is still the standard method for performing antibiotic \nsusceptibility testing. However, this organism is not easy to grow in the laboratory and \nrequires special training and a special culture medium. For this reason, culture of Neisseria \ngonorrhoeae  is not routinely performed as part of managing people with gonococcal \ninfection in resource-limited settings. \nNeisseria gonorrhoeae  can also be identified by light microscopy of Gram-stained \nsamples and a presumptive diagnosis can be made if intracellular Gram-negative diplococci \nare observed in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, best seen when there is a urethral discharge. \nGram-stained smears from the cervix are also considered positive for the presumptive \ndiagnosis of gonorrhoea in women if intracellular Gram-negative diplococci are observed \nin polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Gram stain of urethral samples among women has low \nyield and may not be cost-effective. \nFor more comprehensive information on the diagnosis of gonococcal infection, \nplease refer to the most recent (2013) WHO guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of STIs \n(192) . Please check the WHO website regularly for possible updates. Patients with gonococcal \ninfection are also usually evaluated for other STIs, such as chlamydial infection, hepatitis B, \nhepatitis C, HIV infection and syphilis.\nTests to consider when gonococcal infection is suspected are listed in Table 20.1. \nAdditional tests for other STIs that could be considered when gonococcal infection is \nconfirmed or suspected are shown in Table 20.2.\nTable 20.1 \u2013 Microbiology tests to consider when gonococcal infection is \nsuspected as indicated in the WHO EDL (6)\nDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Settings where \nthe test should \nbe available\nQualitative test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae  and \nChlamydia trachomatis  infections (i.e. nucleic \nacid amplification test)a,b\nThis is the recommended reference \nstandardTo diagnose \ngonorrhoeal and/or \nchlamydial urogenital \ndisease and extragenital \ninfectionHealth care \nfacilities \nwith clinical \nlaboratories\nMicroscopy (Gram stain)cTo assess microbial \nmorphology, and \npresence or absence of \nwhite blood cellsHealth care \nfacilities \nwith clinical \nlaboratories\ncontinues248 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n20.

Because of increasing antibiotic resistance to azithromycin in \nNeisseria gonorrhoeae  and Mycoplasma genitalium  and reduced susceptibility of Neisseria \ngonorrhoeae  to cephalosporins, WHO is currently revising treatment recommendations \nand dosages (please check the WHO website regularly for possible updates) .\nAll people (including pregnant women) diagnosed with gonorrhoea should receive \nadequate antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic treatment options are shown in Table 20.3. \nWhen choosing treatment, local resistance data should determine the choice of the \nmost appropriate therapy. If data are not available, dual therapy (i.e. two antibiotics) should \nbe given. If symptoms do not resolve within about 5 days of adequate antibiotic treatment, \na resistant infection should be suspected, or an alternative diagnosis sought.\nTable 20.3 \u2013 Antibiotic treatment for gonococcal infection as indicated in the 2016 \nWHO guidelines for the treatment of gonorrhoea (89)\nImportant\nWHO is currently revising treatment recommendations and dosages (please check the WHO \nwebsite regularly for possible updates). \nWhere more than one antibiotic is recommended for an infection, they are listed in alphabetical \norder and they should be considered equal treatment options, unless otherwise indicated.\nType of gonococcal \ninfectionTreatment Total treatment \nduration\nGenital and anorectal \ninfections ( dual therapya)First choice\n Ceftriaxone  (IM): 250 mg AND\n Azithromycin  (oral): 1 g\nSecond choice\n Cefixime  (oral): 400 mg AND\n Azithromycin  (oral): 1 gSingle dose\nGenital and anorectal \ninfections ( single therapy ), \nif local resistance data \nconfirm susceptibility to the \nantibiotic Cefixime  (oral): 400 mg\nOR\n Ceftriaxone  (IM): 250 mgb\nOR\n Spectinomycin  (IM): 2 gSingle dose\ncontinues252 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n20.

Syphilis \nis one of other treponematoses, that is, diseases caused by spirochaetes of the species \nTreponema pallidum . Other Treponema pallidum  subspecies causing human diseases \ninclude subspecies pertenue , the causative pathogen of yaws (212) , subspecies endemicum , \nthe causative pathogen of endemic syphilis or bejel, and subspecies carateum , the causative \npathogen of pinta (213) . This chapter will only address disease caused by Treponema pallidum  \nsubspecies pallidum  (syphilis). Information about other treponematoses is available on the \nWHO website (212) .\nSyphilis can be classified as early or late based on the time since becoming infected. \nUsually infections of \u2264 2 years duration are defined as early and infections of > 2 years are \ndefined as late. Furthermore, infections can be classified as primary, secondary or tertiary \nbased on the clinical presentation (210) . There is usually a long latent phase with no clinical \nmanifestations between secondary and tertiary infection; the tertiary phase only develops \nin untreated or inadequately treated infections. Overlap between these definitions exists, \nwith early infection including primary and secondary syphilis and late infection including \nthe latent phase and tertiary syphilis. \nThe latent phase can also be divided into two phases \u2013 early latent and late latent. \nEarly latent syphilis is usually defined as infection of < 2 years, whereas late latent syphilis is \ndefined as the presence of the disease of \u2265 2 years (210) .

Sexually transmitted infections \u2013 syphilis\nPathogen\nSyphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum  subspecies pallidum , a bacterium of the phylum \nSpirochaetes; other members of this phylum include Leptospira  and Borrelia . \nTreponema pallidum  is characterized by slow growth, difficulty in culturing in vitro, \nand its thinness \u2013 0.2 \u03bcm compared to about 0.5 \u03bcm for a bacterium like Escherichia coli  \u2013 \nwhich makes it difficult to see with conventional microscopy.\nResistance to penicillin has not yet been reported and therefore it remains the \nantibiotic of choice for the treatment of syphilis. Resistance to azithromycin has been \nreported in some settings (214) .\nPathophysiology\nSyphilis is usually acquired through sexual contact with infectious lesions on the mucosa or \nskin or, much more rarely, through the bloodstream. The infection can also be transmitted \nfrom the mother to her fetus because Treponema pallidum  subspecies pallidum  can cross \nthe placenta and cause fetal death and congenital infection.\nWith sexual transmission, once Treponema pallidum  subspecies pallidum  enters the \nsubcutaneous tissue, infection develops within 2\u20136 weeks (usually about 3 weeks) with \nformation of an ulcerative lesion that occurs at the site of inoculation. Usually, the immune \nsystem is able to control the early infection and, even if left untreated, the primary ulcerative \nlesion (i.e. chancre) resolves. However, dissemination of Treponema pallidum  through the \nbloodstream can occur at the time of primary infection and this can result over time in \nsecondary or tertiary syphilis in the absence of adequate treatment. In particular, tertiary \nsyphilis has a long incubation period (up to years or decades after the initial infection) and \ndevelops in about a third of patients with untreated syphilis. In 2017, 370 000 prevalent cases \nof tertiary syphilis were reported worldwide but this number is probably an underestimation \nof the true burden of the disease (44).\nCongenital syphilis can occur as a result of vertical transmission of the pathogen \nfrom an infected mother to the fetus. The risk of transmission depends on a combination of \nfactors, including maternal titres of non-treponemal tests (see Table 21.1 for an explanation \nabout tests), timing, adequacy of maternal treatment and stage of maternal infection. The \nestimated total number of cases of congenital syphilis worldwide in 2016 was 661 000, or \n473 per 100 000 live births (215) .\nEpidemiology\nSyphilis is a common curable STI and its incidence is increasing globally. WHO estimates \nthere were 7 million new cases in 2020 (193) . Other bacterial STIs occur more frequently, for The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 259PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n21. Sexually transmitted infections \u2013 syphilis\nexample, in 2020 more than 82 million new cases of gonorrhoea and about 128 million new \ncases of chlamydial infection were reported (193) . However, syphilis has an important public \nhealth impact because of the potential serious consequences if left untreated, including \nmaternal transmission to the fetus resulting in congenital syphilis and fetal death, and \ncomplications such as neurosyphilis and cardiovascular syphilis.\nMoreover, as with other STIs, syphilis affects quality of life and increases the risk \nof transmitting or acquiring other STIs including HIV infection. This HIV risk is of particular \nconcern because STIs characterized by the presence of ulcerative lesions have the highest \nrisk of HIV transmission (216) .\nThe risk factors for syphilis include: having multiple sexual partners or a new sexual \npartner; having partners with STIs; having had a previous STI; and several socioeconomic factors, \nsuch as low socioeconomic or educational level, substance abuse and young age (217,218) . \nLack of access to adequate prenatal care is an important risk factor for congenital syphilis.\nClinical presentation\nSigns and symptoms of syphilis vary depending on the stage of the disease, early or late.\nEarly syphilis has the following signs and symptoms.\n\u2022 Primary infection (localized disease). This is characterized by the presence of a \nlocalized non-painful ulcerative lesion (i.e. chancre) with indurated margins, \nusually associated with local lymphadenopathy. The lesion is usually located on \nthe genitalia, mouth or rectum but other locations are possible depending on the \nsite of inoculation. The lesion is often asymptomatic and can remain unnoticed, \nparticularly among women. If left untreated, the lesion usually resolves within a \nfew weeks without leaving a scar.\n\u2022 Secondary infection (disseminated disease). This is characterized by skin and \nmucosal manifestations. Generally, a maculopapular non-irritant rash appears \nwhich is usually diffuse and extends bilaterally over the trunk and the extremities. \nA characteristic feature is the involvement of the palms of the hands and soles \nof the feet. The mucous membranes of the mouth and perineum can also show \nlesions (mostly flat lesions) that are highly infectious. Systemic manifestations (e.g. \nfever \u2265 38.0 \u00b0C, generalized lymphadenopathy and malaise) are usually present. \nNeurological manifestations (e.g. meningitis), hepatitis and ocular involvement \ncan also occur in this phase.\nLate syphilis has the following signs and symptoms.\n\u2022 Tertiary syphilis (disseminated disease). This can occur as the result of an untreated \nearly syphilis after a period of latency, with no clinical manifestations, that may last  260 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n21. Sexually transmitted infections \u2013 syphilis\nyears. Usually tertiary syphilis develops more rapidly in patients with HIV. In this \nphase, different organ systems can be affected, particularly: the cardiovascular \nsystem (typically with signs and symptoms of aortitis); the skin, soft tissues and \nbones (typically with granulomatous or nodular lesions also known as gummas); \nand the central nervous system (typically with symptoms of progressive dementia, \npsychiatric syndrome and tabes dorsalis, which is characterized by problems with \ncoordination of movements, pain radiating from the spine and impaired response \nof the pupils to light).\nCongenital syphilis infection during pregnancy can lead to spontaneous abortion or \npremature birth. Most babies with congenital syphilis are asymptomatic at birth but when \nsymptoms are present, they usually develop days or weeks after birth. These symptoms often \ninclude anaemia, thrombocytopenia, rash (maculopapular, desquamative rash particularly \nover the palms, soles, mouth and anus), generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and \njaundice, nasal discharge (that may turn bloody), painful osteitis (mostly in long bones) and \nteeth abnormalities. The cerebrospinal fluid is abnormal, indicating neurological disease, in \nup to half of all babies. Of note, neurological consequences can be expressed later in life and \nthis should always be considered with congenital syphilis.\nLaboratory tests \nFor more comprehensive information on diagnosis of syphilis, please refer to the most \nrecent (2013) WHO guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of STIs (192) . Please check the \nWHO website regularly for possible updates.\nPatient microbiology tests\nIn patients with suspected syphilis, microbiology tests can support the diagnosis (Table \n21.1). Certain microbiology tests are also used to screen asymptomatic pregnant women. \nFor screening during pregnancy, please refer to the most recent (2017) WHO guideline on \nsyphilis screening and treatment for pregnant women (211) .\nDirect detection methods \nThese methods can be used to detect the pathogen in specimens obtained from skin or \ntissues lesions (Table 21.1). Direct detection methods include: dark-field microscopy where \nTreponema pallidum  from lesions of primary syphilis can be observed (of note, a negative \ndark-field result does not exclude syphilis); and nucleic acid amplification tests to detect \nDNA sequences specific to Treponema pallidum . Direct detection is considered the gold \nstandard but it is much less frequently used today because it is more time-consuming than \nserological tests.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 261PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n21. Sexually transmitted infections \u2013 syphilis\nSerological tests\nTwo types of serological test can be used, treponemal and non-treponemal. \n\u2022 Treponemal tests detect antibodies to treponemal antigens and usually remain \npositive after infection even after successful treatment. These tests include: \nfluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test; Treponema pallidum particle \nagglutination  assay; and Treponema pallidum  haemagglutination assay. Treponemal \nrapid diagnostic tests for syphilis are available and prequalified by WHO.\n\u2022 Non-treponemal tests detect antibodies that react to lipids, for example, \ncardiolipin released during cellular damage that occurs in response to Treponema \npallidum . These are qualitative and quantitative tests that can also be used to \nmonitor response to treatment because their titres tend to decline after adequate \ntreatment and may become negative (i.e. non-reactive) over time. These tests \ninclude: rapid plasma reagin test and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test.\nInitially, a two-step approach is used to test for syphilis and both types of tests \u2013 \ntreponemal and non-treponemal \u2013 need to be positive to confirm the diagnosis. In order to \nincrease access to testing and ensure same-day treatment, WHO recommends the use of a \nrapid treponemal test followed (if positive) by a non-treponemal test. \nHowever, starting with a non-treponemal test and confirmation of positive results \nwith a treponemal test is also appropriate. \nAll serological tests for syphilis (non-treponemal and treponemal tests) are negative \nin the early phase of primary syphilis and take 1\u20134 weeks after the chancre appears to \nbecome reactive. Both treponemal and non-treponemal tests are reactive in secondary or \ntertiary syphilis.\nNon-treponemal tests can rarely give false positive results, for example, during \npregnancy or during an acute febrile illness. Figure 21.1 and Figure 21.2 and Table 21.2 can \nbe used to help with the interpretation of the results of serological tests.\nAdditional tests for other STIs that could be considered when syphilis is confirmed \nor suspected are shown in Table 21.3.262 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n21.

These tests are also assumed to be \navailable at health care facilities with laboratories.\nc If neurosyphilis is suspected (this can occur at any stage of infection including in the first few months), the VDRL \ntest can also be used on the cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of a positive syphilis serology. The test has a high \nspecificity (i.e. few false-positive results) but a low sensitivity (i.e. many false-negative results). Examination of the \ncerebrospinal fluid is recommended where there is clinical evidence of neurological involvement. It is also highly \ndesirable in all patients with syphilis of more than 2 years duration or of uncertain duration in order to evaluate the \npossible presence of asymptomatic neurosyphilis (219) .\nd Treponemal tests usually remain positive after the infection has been cleared.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 263PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n21.

Serological response to treatment can be assessed by repeating a \nnon-treponemal quantitative test \u2013 ideally the same type of non-treponemal test used at \nthe time of diagnosis \u2013 to detect a reduction in titre. A four-fold reduction, or higher, in titres \nshould be seen to confirm an adequate response to treatment for early syphilis.

Sexually transmitted infections \u2013 trichomoniasis\nPathogen\nTrichomoniasis is caused by Trichomonas vaginalis , an anaerobe flagellated protozoan. \nPathophysiology\nTrichomonas vaginalis  infects the mucosa of the urogenital tract during sexual contact and \nproduces a local inflammatory response that causes vaginal or urethral discharge.\nEpidemiology\nTrichomoniasis is the most prevalent STI worldwide with an estimated 156 million new \ncases in 2020 as reported by WHO (193) . \nThe infection most commonly affects women older than 40 years. As with other STIs, the \nrisk of acquiring or transmitting HIV is higher in cases of trichomoniasis and the infection \nis associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy, such as preterm delivery, premature \nrupture of membranes and low birth weight (220) . If left untreated, trichomoniasis can \npersist for months or years and in pregnant women, it can be transmitted to the baby during \ndelivery. Common risk factors for infection include multiple sex partners, a history of having \nother STIs (e.g. HIV infection) and substance abuse.\nClinical presentation\nMost cases of trichomoniasis are asymptomatic, especially in men, or have mild symptoms. \nIn women, symptoms include acute onset of vaginal inflammation and discharge (usually \ncharacterized by a bad smell and with a frothy appearance), dysuria and pelvic pain. In \nmen, symptomatic infection usually presents with urethral discharge, dysuria, and testicular \ndiscomfort or pain. Epididymitis and prostatitis can also occur in a minority of cases.\nLaboratory tests \nFor more comprehensive information on the diagnosis of trichomoniasis, please refer to the \nmost recent (2013) WHO guideline on the laboratory diagnosis of STIs (192) . Please check \nthe WHO website regularly for possible updates.\nPatient microbiology tests\nAll people with trichomoniasis are also usually evaluated for other STIs, such as chlamydial \ninfection, gonococcal infection, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, HIV infection and syphilis.274 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n22. Sexually transmitted infections \u2013 trichomoniasis\nTests to consider when trichomoniasis is suspected are indicated in Table 22.1.\nMolecular assays such as nucleic acid amplification tests have the highest sensitivity \nof all diagnostic methods to detect Trichomonas vaginalis  but they are not currently widely \navailable as rapid point-of-care tests. However, if available, they should be used. Vaginal \nswabs are the samples of choice, but endocervical samples and urine can be used for some \nassays. \nHistorically, trichomoniasis has been diagnosed by performing wet mount \nmicroscopy. Although this is not the gold standard technique, a wet mount is frequently \nused because it is quick, inexpensive and easy to perform. However, to have a good chance \nof successfully identifying the motile trichomonads, the slide should be read within 10 \nminutes of collection of the sample since trichomonads quickly lose their motility. Non-\nmotile cells cannot be diagnosed as trichomonads due to possible misidentification; for \nexample, a non-motile trichomonad is difficult to differentiate from the nucleus of a vaginal \nepithelial cell.\nCulture of Trichomonas vaginalis , which has a higher sensitivity than the wet mount \nmicroscopic examination, was the cornerstone for detecting this organism before the \nadvent of point-of-care antigen tests and nucleic acid amplification tests. Although a culture \nmedium is commercially available, cultures of samples from women with trichomoniasis are \nusually positive in the first 3 days of inoculation, but they have to be incubated for up to 7 \ndays to rule out infection. Routine culture methods detecting Trichomonas vaginalis  are no \nlonger widely performed.\nAdditional tests for other STIs that could be considered when trichomoniasis is \nconfirmed or suspected are shown in Table 22.2.\nTable 22.1 \u2013 Microbiology tests to consider when trichomoniasis is suspected as \nindicated in the WHO EDL (6)\nDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Settings where the test \nshould be available\nMicroscopya,bTo assess microbial morphology \nand presence or absence of \nwhite blood cellsHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\nCulturebInitial step to detect and identify \nbacterial species for selection of \nappropriate antibiotic regimensHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\nEDL: Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics.\na If available, nucleic acid amplification tests for Trichomonas vaginalis  could be considered, especially if the \nmicroscopy examination is negative.

These infections are often classified as either complicated or \nuncomplicated based on the presence of risk factors that make them more difficult to treat.\nComplications can occur with lower UTIs because of certain patient-related risk \nfactors. While there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a complicated \nUTI, lower UTIs in individuals with certain conditions of the urinary tract (e.g. anatomical \nanomalies and kidney stones) are generally complicated. Infections in pregnant women \nare also usually included in this category. Examples of factors that may increase the risk of a \ncomplicated lower UTI are shown in Box 23.1 but should not be considered a complete list.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 279PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n23.

Lower urinary tract infection\nPathophysiology\nLower UTIs occur when pathogens (usually ascending the urethra from the perineal area) \nreach the bladder and overcome the host defences, which leads to parenchymal damage and \nan inflammatory response. Microorganisms in the urine do not inevitably lead to infection. \nInfection will depend on the interaction between the organism (for example, because of \nvirulence factors of the pathogen), the patient (who may have more infections because of \nunderlying diseases) and the environment (for example, the presence of a urinary catheter).\nEpidemiology \nLower UTIs are very common worldwide and can affect people of any age. According to the \nGlobal Burden of Disease study, in 2017 there were an estimated 274 million new cases of \nUTIs (lower and upper) globally, combining all ages and both sexes (44). \nThe incidence of UTIs is highest in women and increases with age (e.g. UTIs increase \nafter menopause) and frequency of sexual activity. These infections are particularly common \nin women because of the anatomy of their lower urinary tract; women have a shorter urethra \nthan men and so microorganisms colonizing the skin of the perineal area can more easily \nreach the bladder. However, after 65 years of age, rates of lower UTIs in men and women \ntend to be more similar (223) . It is estimated that more than 50% of women experience at \nleast one episode of lower UTI in their lifetime. After a first episode, the risk of recurrence \nin young women has been estimated to be about 70% within a year (224) . Risk factors for \nUTIs include anatomical and functional abnormalities of the urinary tract, for example, \nconditions that predispose to incomplete emptying of the bladder, renal insufficiency and \nurinary incontinence. Defective host immune factors (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes or \nneutropenia) and instrumentation of the urinary tract (e.g. urinary catheters and stents) are \nalso predisposing factors. \nMost likely pathogens\nLower UTIs are usually caused by bacteria that are part of the human intestinal microbiota, \nmost frequently Escherichia coli . In clinical practice a causative pathogen is usually only \nidentified in more severe cases when urinary cultures are obtained. Pathogens that most \nfrequently cause UTIs are shown in Table 23.1. Data on causative organisms from low- and \nmiddle-income countries are limited; however, if a difference exists in the proportion of \nless common pathogens, it is unlikely to affect management. In Africa and the Middle East \nSchistosoma haematobium  can present with haematuria and signs of a UTI, particularly \nin children.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 285PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n23.

In women, vaginal discharge or irritation \nshould be excluded before concluding a diagnosis of lower UTI. In elderly patients with \npre-existing urinary symptoms (e.g. urinary incontinence), the evaluation may be more \ndifficult. However, the most reliable symptoms in these cases are still acute urinary changes \ncompared with the baseline. Atypical symptoms, such as falls and altered mental status, are \nunreliable. In addition, cloudy urine and smelly urine alone are not reliable signs of a UTI. \nIn children, symptoms can include vomiting, low-grade fever, increased urgency and \nfrequency, dysuria, new incontinence, smelly urine, or lower abdominal pain and discomfort. \nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nIn symptomatic patients at a higher risk of complications and in children, a urine culture may \nbe performed (Table 23.2). The rationale is to confirm the diagnosis and to adjust empiric \ntreatment based on susceptibility results.286 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n23. Lower urinary tract infection\nIn children, a clean catch specimen is difficult to obtain but is preferred to a \nspecimen obtained with a urine collection bag. Positive urine cultures in patients without \nsymptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria) are frequent and not indicative of bacterial cystitis. \nExcept for very select cases (for example, pregnant women, or before invasive urological \ninterventions), asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antibiotics.\nTable 23.2 \u2013 Microbiology tests to consider for diagnosis of lower urinary tract \ninfections as indicated in the WHO EDL (6)\nDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Settings where the test should \nbe available\nUrine culturea \nand antimicrobial \nsusceptibility testingInitial step to detect and identify \nbacterial and fungal species \nfor selection of appropriate \nantimicrobial regimensHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\nEDL: Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics.\na A positive urine culture in an asymptomatic patient indicates bacterial colonization and does not \nrequire treatment except in pregnant women or in patients undergoing urological procedures in which \nbleeding is anticipated . Bacterial colonization of the urine is a common finding, especially in women, the elderly \n(both sexes) and individuals with underlying urological abnormalities. Of note, the absence of urine leukocytes has \na good negative predictive value but the positive predictive value of leukocyturia is poor.\nOther tests\nIn patients with symptoms of a UTI, a urinalysis (dipstick or microscopy) may be done to detect \nthe presence of bacteriuria and pyuria (Table 23.3), while blood tests are not generally used \nto confirm infection \u2013 tests results would be normal in case of lower UTI. In a symptomatic \npatient, leukocyturia (> 10 leukocytes/\u03bcL, 0.01 x 109/L), the presence of leukocyte esterase \nand/or positive nitrites are indirect signs of infection. Of note, leukocyturia or the presence of \nleukocyte esterase without symptoms is not an indication for antibiotic treatment.\nTable 23.3 \u2013 Laboratory tests to consider for diagnosis of lower urinary tract \ninfections as indicated in the WHO EDL (6)\nDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Settings where the test should \nbe available\nUrinalysis test strips To detect urinary tract infections Community settings and health \nfacilities without laboratoriesa\nEDL: Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics.\na Community and health settings without laboratories are settings such as health posts and centres, doctors\u2019 offices, \noutreach clinics and ambulatory care. These tests are also assumed to be available at health care facilities with laboratories.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 287PRIMARY HEALTH CARE   \uf067\n23. Lower urinary tract infection\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nEmpiric treatment would ideally be guided by recent clinically relevant local microbiology \nsurveillance data, however these data are not routinely available. This would include clinical \nmicrobiology surveys of urine culture data from patients with lower UTI in the primary \ncare/community setting, not hospital outpatient clinic data which likely over-estimate the \nprevalence of resistance. These surveys would ideally include information on the current \nand previous recent antibiotic treatment, clinical disease severity, patient risk factors and \nclinical outcomes. The focus would be on significant urine bacterial isolates resistant to \nantibiotics recommended in the EML and EMLc, such as nitrofurantoin. \nImaging\nInitial imaging (e.g. ultrasound) of the urinary tract is not needed to diagnose a lower UTI. \nImaging to investigate possible underlying abnormalities of the urinary tract could be \nconsidered, mostly in children and male patients.\nNo antibiotic care\nAnalgesic treatment should be complementary to antibiotic treatment to relieve pain \nassociated with lower UTIs (Table 23.4). In young women who are not pregnant, clinically \nwell, with a mild infection and who may wish to avoid or delay antibiotic treatment, \nsymptomatic treatment alone (with a back-up antibiotic prescription) could be considered.288 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n23.

Lower urinary tract infection\nAntibiotic treatment \nAntibiotic treatment is usually given empirically if there are compatible signs and symptoms \nof a UTI AND  a positive test (urinalysis or urine culture). If diagnostic tests cannot be \nperformed, treatment may be given based on clinical presentation alone. If a urine culture is \nperformed, empiric treatment should be reassessed once the results of susceptibility testing \nare available. \nClinical improvement should be within 48\u201372 hours of starting treatment. In \ngeneral, antibiotics shorten the duration of symptoms by about 2 days (225) . Efforts to \nreduce patient self-medication with antibiotics should be made as self-medication is still \nvery common in some settings (226) .\nLocal patterns of AMR, mostly to Escherichia coli , should be considered when \navailable but interpreted with caution. In most cases, the summary prevalence of resistance \nreported by hospital microbiology laboratories will probably not be representative of first \ninfections in the primary health care setting and may overestimate the true prevalence \nof resistance for lower UTIs because of selection bias. Most urine cultures are done on \npatients who have relapsed after their first empiric treatment and are being re-treated or \nhave underlying reason for a higher risk of resistant infections. Most lower UTIs in patients \nwho are not at risk of complications are still caused by pathogens that are susceptible to \ncommonly used antibiotics. However, patterns of resistance based on good quality local \ndata when available and on individual risk factors (e.g. previous urine culture results and \nrecent antibiotic exposure) should be considered (227\u2013229) . In particular, Escherichia coli  \nmay have varying levels of resistance to first-choice antibiotics (230)  and resistance is \nassociated with higher rates of clinical failure (15). \nNitrofurantoin for 5 days is the main antibiotic recommended for acute cystitis. \nHowever, the paediatric formulation (syrup) may not be widely available and is currently \nexpensive, even in high-income settings. Nitrofurantoin still has activity against most \nisolates producing ESBL (231) .\nDifferent empiric antibiotic options for treating lower UTIs are shown in Table 23.5.\nTreatment duration is influenced by the antibiotic used, the age and sex of the \npatient, and for women by the presence of pregnancy. 290 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  PRIMARY HEALTH CARE\n23.

Sepsis in adults (including septic \nshock)\nKey messages\n\u2022 Sepsis is an acute life-threatening condition characterized by organ dysfunction due to \na dysregulated host response to infection. Its most severe form \u2013 associated with high \nmortality \u2013 is septic shock.\n\u2022 Usually signs and symptoms are non-specific, the presence of any danger signs of severe \nillness should always be assessed to guide clinical management.\n\u2022 Antibiotic treatment should be started as soon as possible when sepsis is suspected. \nHowever, not every patient with an infection has sepsis and the term sepsis should therefore \nbe used carefully.\n\u2022 Diagnostic tests and imaging should not delay treatment and should be guided by the \nsuspected site of primary infection.\n\u2022 Antibiotic treatment should be regularly re-evaluated including the possibility to simplify or \nstop antibiotics.\nOther relevant WHO resources (please check regularly for updates)\n\u2022 Sepsis \u2013 fact sheet (234) .\n\u2022 Global report on the epidemiology and burden of sepsis: current evidence, identifying gaps \nand future directions (235) .\n\u2022 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in infants and children under 5 years of age: WHO \nposition paper \u2013February 2019 (35).\n\u2022 Typhoid vaccines: WHO position paper \u2013 March 2018 (154) .\n\u2022 Meningococcal A conjugate vaccine: updated guidance, February 2015 (236) .\nDefinition\nIn some patients with infection, a dysregulated host immune response to the infection \ncontributes to the severity of the disease and organ dysfunction.

Sepsis in adults (including septic shock)\nThe definition of sepsis has remained a challenge because sepsis is not a single entity (the \npathogens and primary sites of infection causing sepsis, for example, vary widely) but a \ncontinuum of many different clinical presentations.\nBecause of the serious clinical consequences of sepsis (see section on epidemiology), \nmany attempts have been made to provide clinicians with simple and easy-to-use criteria \nfor identifying patients with sepsis.\nNote\nSepsis in adults was last defined in 2016 by the Third International Consensus Definitions for \nSepsis and Septic Shock, known as SEPSIS-3 (237) . According to this definition, sepsis is a life-\nthreatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.\nCompared with previous definitions (SEPSIS-1 in 1991 and SEPSIS 2 in 2001), \nSEPSIS-3 removed the criteria for \u201csystemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)\u201d from \nthe definition because the criteria lacked specificity. SIRS referred to an exaggerated \ninflammatory response of the body to a noxious cause characterized by a combination \nof symptoms such as fever or hypothermia, increased heart and/or respiratory rate and \nincreased white blood cell count. SEPSIS-3 also dropped the term severe sepsis because \nthe concept of non-severe sepsis was not helpful \u2013 all sepsis is a severe disease \u2013 and could \nbe misleading and divert attention from providing rapid and effective treatment. Instead, \nSEPSIS-3 differentiates only between sepsis and septic shock. Septic shock is defined as a \ntype of sepsis in which underlying circulatory and cellular and/or metabolic abnormalities \nare severe enough to substantially increase mortality. Patients with septic shock have \npersistent hypotension that requires vasopressor medication to maintain a mean arterial \npressure of 65 mmHg or more and a level of serum lactate more than 2 mmol/L (> 18 mg/\ndL) in the absence of hypovolaemia (238) .\nIt should be noted that the definition of sepsis does not include the detection of \nbacteria in blood cultures (i.e. bacteraemia). See Box 24.1 for terms and definitions related \nto bloodstream infections.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 297HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n24. Sepsis in adults (including septic shock)\nBox 24.1 \u2013 Bacteraemia\nBacteraemia (i.e. the detection of bacteria in blood cultures) is not part of the definition of sepsis. \nWhile many patients with sepsis have bacteraemia, this is not a universal finding and most \npatients with bacteraemia do not meet sepsis criteria. The term septicaemia should be avoided. \nThe terms bacteraemia and bloodstream infection, are often used interchangeably. However \nbloodstream infections can also be caused by pathogens other than bacteria (e.g. fungi).\nThe Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) uses the following definition \nof suspected bloodstream infection (239) : \nPresence of two or more of the following clinical signs in an adult patient:\n\u2022 Hyperthermia (> 38.0 \u00b0C) or hypothermia (< 36.0 \u00b0C)\n\u2022 Respiratory rate \u2265 20 breaths/minute\n\u2022 Heart rate > 90 beats/minute.\nA confirmed bloodstream infection requires the isolation of a clinically relevant pathogen from \na blood sample of a patient (all ages) seeking health care at a health care facility.\nThe criteria to identify sepsis according to SEPSIS-3 are difficult to apply in low- and \nmiddle-income countries because severity is based on criteria and tests that may not be \nroutinely available in these settings, for example, the use of inotropes, and determination \nof arterial oxygen partial pressure, bilirubin levels, creatinine concentrations and platelet \ncounts. Furthermore, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (see Table 24.1) \nhas been validated mostly in high-income settings. Its performance in low- and middle-\nincome countries, where causes of sepsis rarely encountered in most high-income settings \n(e.g. dengue and malaria) are frequent and HIV infection is more prevalent, is unclear.\nTo implement the SEPSIS-3 definition, clinical and laboratory signs are graded to \ngive an overall SOFA score, and an acute change of two or more points in the baseline \nscore is proposed to identify organ dysfunction due to infection and predict the short-term \nmortality risk (237) . \nThe SOFA score (range 0\u201324) includes six parameters \u2013 two clinical and four \nlaboratory ones. Each parameter can have a value from 0 to 4 (Table 24.1). The baseline SOFA \nscore can be assumed to be zero in patients with no known pre-existing organ dysfunction.298 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n24.

A retrospective analysis of cohort studies conducted in \n17 hospitals in 10 low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the \nAmericas found that a high qSOFA score identified patients with infections who were at an \nincreased risk of death (beyond the risk they had based on their baseline risk factors), with \nsome variability among cohorts (241) .\nTable 24.2 \u2013 Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score\nParameter Value\nRespiratory rate \u2265 22 breaths/min\nAltered mental status Glasgow coma scale < 15a\nSystolic blood pressure \u2264 100 mmHg (\u2264 13.3 kPa)\na The Glasgow come scale is a clinical scale used to measure a person\u2019s level of consciousness based on the \nassessment of three parameters: eye opening response (maximum 4 points assigned), best verbal response \n(maximum 5 points assigned) and best motor response (maximum 6 points assigned).

Sepsis in adults (including septic shock)\nPathophysiology\nSepsis is a serious and complex clinical condition caused by a complicated interplay \nbetween an infectious agent and a dysregulated systemic immunological response by the \npatient, which could potentially result in multiple organ dysfunction and possibly death. \nRisk factors for sepsis mostly overlap with those that predispose patients to infection, for \nexample, being very old or very young, immunosuppression due to HIV infection, cancer, on \nmedications, cirrhosis, alcohol abuse, poorly controlled diabetes, indwelling catheters and \nmalnutrition. Genetic factors are also implicated in the likelihood of developing sepsis in \npatients with an infection (242) .\nEpidemiology\nSepsis is an important global health problem that can be difficult to diagnose and manage, \nespecially in low-income settings (234,243) . According to the Global Burden of Disease \nstudy, about 49 million new cases of sepsis occurred worldwide in 2017, a decrease of \nalmost 19% compared with 1990 (244) . The most common underlying cause of sepsis is still \ndiarrhoeal disease \u2013 9 million attributable cases in 2017. Since 2017, the number of sepsis-\nrelated deaths has decreased worldwide (a 29% decrease compared with 1990) but deaths \nwere still high (11 million in 2017) with the highest burden in sub-Saharan Africa. The most \ncommon underlying cause of sepsis-related death was lower respiratory tract infections, 1.8 \nmillion attributable deaths in 2017. Children were more affected by sepsis than adults; in \n2017, 20 million new cases of sepsis were in children < 5 years of age (see the chapter on \nsepsis in children and neonates). However, a second peak in incidence in older adults was \nreported. About one in four cases of sepsis is estimated to be hospital-acquired with high \nmortality rates (245) .\nSepsis can also develop during pregnancy or in the first weeks after delivery. This \nform of sepsis is called maternal sepsis. In 2017, about 12 million new cases of maternal \nsepsis were reported (244) . In the period 2003\u20132009, sepsis was the third leading cause \nof maternal death worldwide (10.7% of all maternal deaths or about 260 000 deaths) after \nhaemorrhage and hypertensive disorders (246) . Based on results of the global maternal \nsepsis study of more than 700 facilities in 52 countries, 70 pregnant women per 1000 live \nbirths in the study cohort were hospitalized with an infection, mostly of bacterial origin \n\u2013 77% of those where a pathogen was identified (247) . Infections with severe maternal \noutcomes (e.g. death) were frequent (11 per 1000 live births); however, large variations \nexisted across countries \u2013 15 per 1000 live births in low- and middle-income countries and \n0.6 per 1000 in high-income countries. Infections originated most often from the genital \n(endometritis and chorioamnionitis) or urinary tract followed by skin, respiratory and \nabortion-related infections (247) .The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 305HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n24. Sepsis in adults (including septic shock)\nInfections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria are an increasingly important cause of \nsepsis worldwide with important implications for the management, especially in settings \nwith limited resources. Antibiotic resistance can affect patient outcomes, increasing short-\nterm mortality, mostly because in these cases effective antibiotic treatment active against \nthe resistant pathogen may not be available or given late. In a 2015 European study, 170 \nDALYs per 100 000 population were due to infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, \nof which about 70% were caused by bloodstream infections (248) . \nIn 2017, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution on sepsis to urge WHO \nMember States to implement measures to reduce the burden of sepsis by increasing \nefforts to improve sepsis prevention, diagnosis and treatment, including through increased \nresearch, training of health care professionals and public awareness campaigns (234,249) .\nMost likely pathogens\nSepsis can originate from any type of infection (bacterial, viral, fungal and protozoal) in any \norgan system. Infections can be community-acquired or hospital-acquired (or health care-\nassociated). The bacterial pathogens associated with sepsis will vary widely depending on \nthe primary site of infection, geography and place of acquisition (community or hospital, \nsee Table 24.3).\nPathogens other than bacteria should be considered according to the local \nepidemiology. For example, certain settings are endemic for Plasmodium  spp., the \npathogen causing malaria, and this should always be considered where appropriate, \nincluding after travel to endemic areas. Many other pathogens, including viruses causing \nviral haemorrhagic fevers or respiratory viruses such as the influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 \nand fungal infections, also need to be considered where appropriate (community- and \nhospital-acquired infections).\nThe mortality from sepsis is higher with infections caused by multidrug-resistant \nbacteria, which are commonly identified in hospital-acquired infections.306 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n24.

Sepsis in adults (including septic shock)\nClinical presentation\nNote\nPresenting symptoms and signs and the clinical course of sepsis are highly variable and depend \non the underlying pathogen, the main organ affected and the host response. Early recognition \nand treatment of sepsis is essential and can affect mortality. Therefore, signs of severe infection \nand organ dysfunction should be identified promptly.\nPatients with sepsis usually present with non-specific signs and symptoms. The most \nfrequent symptoms include fever (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C) or hypothermia (< 36.0 \u00b0C), some degree of \nrespiratory distress (e.g. increased respiratory rate), tachycardia, acute altered mental status \n(e.g. disorientation and agitation) and hypotension. Oliguria (i.e. reduced urine output) may \nalso be present.\nSepsis may be more difficult to diagnose in countries where vector-transmitted \ndiseases (e.g. malaria and dengue) are endemic; therefore, sepsis should always be \nconsidered if there are any signs and symptoms of sepsis in these settings.\nAs outlined earlier, bacteraemia (i.e. the detection of bacteria in blood cultures) \nmay be present depending on the type of pathogen, the primary site of infection and \nwhether antibiotic treatment was administered before obtaining blood cultures. However, \nbacteraemia is not always found in patients with sepsis and most patients with bacteraemia \ndo not have sepsis.\nNote\nAccurate identification of patients with sepsis is difficult and no single gold standard test exists. \nTherefore, adoption and use of internationally accepted case definitions (e.g. the SEPSIS-3 \ndefinition) is critical to avoid over-diagnosis and overtreatment. Not every patient with an \ninfection has sepsis, in fact, only a very small proportion of patients with infection have sepsis. \nThe term sepsis should therefore be used carefully.\nSepsis of unknown origin . The treatment of this type of sepsis is based on the \nmost probable clinical situation. Patients should be carefully examined to localize a source \nof infection, including pressure ulcers, deep-seated abscesses and indwelling vascular and \nurinary catheters. In patients with central lines, the possibility of a central line-associated \nbloodstream infection should be considered with a positive blood culture and no other \napparent source of infection. Bloodstream infections can also be associated with peripheral \nvascular lines.308 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n24. Sepsis in adults (including septic shock)\nLaboratory tests\nPatient microbiology tests\nNote\nDiagnostic tests should be guided by the suspected primary site of infection. Tests, and \nmanagement, which are outlined in the following paragraphs, will be different for suspected \npneumonia, intra-abdominal infection, urinary tract infection, meningitis or sepsis of unknown \norigin. Please also refer to specific chapters of the AWaRe book based on the suspected \nunderlying infection.\nMicrobiology tests help establish a definitive diagnosis of sepsis and identify the causative \npathogen and underlying infection. Isolating a pathogen from a normally sterile body site \n(e.g. blood, cerebrospinal fluid) that is compatible with the clinical signs and symptoms \nusually confirms the diagnosis. However, the causative pathogen is not identified in a \nsubstantial proportion of cases, especially in patients pretreated with antibiotics.\nTests to consider when sepsis of bacterial origin is suspected include those listed in \nTable 24.4. Ideally, these tests should be done before starting antibiotic treatment.\nTable 24.4 \u2013 Microbiology tests to consider when sepsis of bacterial origin in \nsuspected depending on the most likely source of infection as indicated in the \nWHO EDL (6)\nSuspected \nunderlying \ninfectionDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Settings where \nthe test should \nbe available\nAll cases \nwhere sepsis is \nsuspected Blood cultures \nand antimicrobial \nsusceptibility \ntestingTo detect bacterial \nbloodstream infectionsHealth care \nfacilities \nwith clinical \nlaboratories\nLower respiratory \ntract infectionSputum \nmicroscopy (Gram \nstain)To assess microbial \nmorphology and \nadequacy of the \nspecimen for culture by \nidentifying white blood \ncells and squamous \nepithelial cellsHealth care \nfacilities \nwith clinical \nlaboratories\ncontinuesThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 309HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n24.

Sepsis in adults (including septic shock)\nUsing microbiology surveillance data \nEmpiric guidance given by the AWaRe book could be reviewed and adapted based on local \nclinically relevant microbiology surveillance data. \nImaging\nNote\nImaging studies should be guided by the suspected primary site of infection. Please also refer \nto specific chapters of the AWaRe book for the suspected underlying infection.\nWhen sepsis is suspected and respiratory distress is present, a chest X-ray (or lung ultrasound) \nis indicated to confirm a lower respiratory tract infection. If an abdominal source of infection \nis suspected, in settings where it is available, a CT scan of the abdomen could be considered, \nfor example, to confirm an intra-abdominal infection. A low-dose CT scan is an acceptable \noption, including in pregnant women (253) . However, because abdominal ultrasound is \nmore widely available, it can be a very helpful alternative depending on the exact site of \ninfection. If sepsis caused by an infection of the urinary tract is suspected, initial imaging \n(e.g. ultrasound) of the urinary tract or during follow-up could be considered if an outflow \nobstruction (e.g. because of urolithiasis) or an abscess are suspected. If a dental infection is \nsuspected, then X-rays are recommended, as detailed in the corresponding chapter.\nTreatment\nTreatment of sepsis includes treatment of the underlying infection, source control and life-\nsaving interventions such as fluid resuscitation and vital organ support which are beyond \nthe scope of the AWaRe book. For more specific guidance on treating sepsis, please refer to \nthe 2016 international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock (254) . Please \nalso consult a 2016 review on the pathophysiology and clinical management of sepsis (255) .\nAntibiotic treatment (if bacterial sepsis is suspected)\nNote\nIntravenous antibiotic treatment should be started as soon as possible when sepsis of bacterial \norigin is suspected. Taking laboratory and microbiology tests or waiting for the results should \nnot delay administration of the first dose of antibiotic treatment.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 313HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n24. Sepsis in adults (including septic shock)\nWhen selecting empiric antibiotic treatment, several factors should be considered, such \nas the most likely site of primary infection, the infecting pathogens and the local pattern \nof AMR. Comorbidities of the patient, including malnutrition and immunosuppression \n(e.g. due to HIV infection or neutropenia) and other factors, such as known colonization \nand/or previous infection with multidrug-resistant organisms, are also important factors \nto consider. Many variables must be considered to provide the best treatment to patients \nwith sepsis. \nTable 24.7 outlines suggested empiric treatment regimens for common primary sites \nof infection. In many infections (e.g. necrotizing fasciitis and intra-abdominal infections), \nsource control (e.g. drainage of an abscess, surgical debridement) is essential.\nIf the pathogen causing the infection is identified and once its antibiotic \nsusceptibilities are known, antibiotics should be reviewed and modified accordingly. \nHowever, even if enough suitable samples have been obtained and tested, a pathogen is \nidentified only in a minority of patients with sepsis (256) . When no pathogen is identified, \nantibiotic treatment should be guided by available laboratory results and clinical response. \nIf an alternative cause of a non-bacterial cause of sepsis has been identified, the possibility \nto stop treatment should be evaluated.\nTreatment duration is often decided on an individual basis according to clinical \nresponse and, if available, changes in laboratory markers of infection.\nSimplify  empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called \nde-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or based on rapid clinical \nimprovement when no microbiology test results are available. In general, the intravenous \nroute is preferred for the initial phase of treatment.\nStep-down  to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms, signs of \ninfection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home \nwhen clinically appropriate.\nIn patients with suspected sepsis of bacterial origin, a risk assessment based \non clinical factors needs to be done, followed by appropriate tests and investigations to \nchoose the best empiric antibiotic treatment. Patient-level and setting-level risk factors for \ninfections caused by resistant bacteria need to be carefully considered.\n\u2022 Low-risk patients : patients with no clinical risk factors for adverse outcomes. \nThese patients have a low risk of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.\n\u2022 High-risk patients : patients with major pre-existing comorbidities or \nimmunocompromised and/or previous colonization or infection with a resistant \npathogen. These patients have a higher risk of infections caused by multidrug-\nresistant bacteria.314 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n24.

Sepsis in neonates (< 28 days) and children (28 days\u201312 years)\nDefinition\nBecause of differences in the microbiology, sepsis in children is often classified as neonatal \nsepsis (newborns < 28 days) and paediatric sepsis (28 days\u201312 years).\nNeonatal sepsis\nThere is no universally accepted definition of neonatal sepsis and definitions vary among \nstudies (258) . However, the term is used to describe a serious systemic condition of infectious \norigin (most commonly bacterial) associated with a combination of clinical and laboratory \nsigns that occurs in the first month of life. \nNeonates are much more likely to have a primary bloodstream infection with no \nunderlying source of infection identified. Furthermore, because of differences in the host \n(neonates have reduced immune responses) and the way the pathogen can be acquired \n(e.g. exposure to maternal pathogens at birth or in utero), the sepsis definitions currently \nused for adults and older children are not specifically designed for use in young infants \n(259,260) . \nNeonatal sepsis has historically been categorized based on either the timing \nof clinical disease onset (early-onset sepsis or late-onset sepsis) or based on where the \ninfection was likely acquired (community-acquired infection or hospital-acquired infection) \n(Box 25.1). The aim of these categorizations is to predict the most likely causative pathogens \nand guide empiric treatment. However, these categorizations have become less helpful as \nmore infants worldwide are born in health care facilities and are exposed to multidrug-\nresistant pathogens in the early neonatal period, either acquired from their mother or \nthrough nosocomial acquisition in the health facility or hospital.\nBox 25.1 \u2013 Commonly used categorizations of neonatal sepsis\nBy timing of onset\n\u2022 early onseta (occurring \u2264 3 days after birth, often acquired vertically from the mother or in \nthe peripartum period)\n\u2022 late onset (occurring > 3 days after birth, often hospital acquired)\nBy setting of acquisition\n\u2022 community setting\n\u2022 hospital setting\naA range of different postnatal ages have been used to define early onset sepsis, including less than 3, 5 or 7 days \nof life.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 321HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n25. Sepsis in neonates (< 28 days) and children (28 days\u201312 years)\nIn settings with limited access to any laboratory tests, an alternative clinical definition \nused by the WHO is: possible serious bacterial infection (261,262) . This definition is based on the \npresence of multiple clinical signs (Box 25.2). If at least one of the signs is present, the neonate \nor young infant requires prompt treatment with antibiotics. Relevant signs to consider include \ndifficulty feeding, history of convulsions, movement only when stimulated, respiratory rate > \n60 breaths/minute, severe chest retractions and temperature \u2265 38.0 \u00b0C or < 35.5 \u00b0C.\nBox 25.2 \u2013 Definition of possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI)\nA young infant is classified as having PSBI when any one or more of the following signs is \npresent:\n\u2022 Not able to feed since birth or stopped feeding well (confirmed by observation) \n\u2022 No movement or movement only on stimulation\n\u2022 Convulsions \n\u2022 Fast breathing (60 breaths per minute or more) in infants younger than 7 days of age\n\u2022 Severe chest in-drawing \n\u2022 Fever (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C) \n\u2022 Low body temperature (< 35.5 \u00b0C)\nClinical signs and symptoms are important predictors of neonatal sepsis, as well as \nperinatal risk factors, such as prematurity/gestational age. Several scores exist that measure \nseverity of sepsis and help predict short-term mortality, but these are almost all derived in \nthe high-income setting. Scores are used to promptly identify neonates who would benefit \nthe most from optimal antibiotic treatment and supportive care.\nBecause of its simplicity, one of the most frequently used scores is the Score for \nNeonatal Acute Physiology\u2013II (SNAP-II score) (263) . This score was developed in 2001 to \npredict outcomes (usually short-term mortality) in cases of possible neonatal sepsis. It should \nbe noted, however, that this score has not been extensively validated in low- and middle-\nincome countries and therefore there is no clear consensus on its use. Some evidence exists \nfrom low- and middle-income country settings that SNAP-II scores differ significantly in \nneonates with sepsis who survive or die in the short-term irrespective of gestational age \n(264) . The SNAPPE-II score is an extension of the SNAP-II score which includes additional \nperinatal parameters (263) . \nSepsis in children beyond neonatal age\nThe definition of possible serious bacterial infection outlined in the previous section on \nneonatal sepsis can also be used beyond neonatal age to children younger than 5 years.322 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n25.

Sepsis in neonates (< 28 days) and children (28 days\u201312 years)\nPathophysiology\nSepsis is an acute life-threatening condition characterized by organ dysfunction/s due to a \ndysregulated host response to infection and to the direct effect of the pathogen (268) .\nA combination of factors contributes to the clinical manifestation and severity of \nsepsis. Severity of sepsis depends on a combination of the amount and virulence of the \npathogen and the immune status of the host, for example, immunological immaturity or \ndysfunction in preterm neonates, severe malnutrition and HIV infection. In addition, the \ntiming of exposure to the pathogen plays an important role in neonates. In this age group, \nearly-onset sepsis is usually associated with in utero infections (e.g. chorioamnionitis) or \ninfections caused by pathogens that colonize the maternal genital tract and that can be \nacquired during delivery. Late-onset sepsis is more commonly associated with postnatal \nacquisition of community- or health care-associated pathogens.\nSepsis in neonates has a non-specific clinical presentation and many neonates with \nsuspected sepsis who receive antibiotics do not have sepsis and do not have any significant \ninfection. This should be considered when sepsis is suspected to avoid over-diagnosis and \novertreatment.\nBeyond the neonatal age, sepsis in children can also be a primary bacterial \nbloodstream infection (e.g. meningococcal or pneumococcal sepsis), most commonly \ncommunity-acquired. Sepsis in children may also be the result of an underlying infection \nin a particular site (e.g. pyelonephritis, intra-abdominal infection or meningitis) or a health \ncare-acquired infection. \nEpidemiology\nIn 2015, about 6 million children younger than 5 years were estimated to have died, mostly in \nsub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia (122) . Neonates account for about half of the deaths in this \nage group. Overall, about 2.7 million neonates died in 2015 and of these, about 400 000 were \nestimated to be the result of sepsis or meningitis, and 517 000 children younger than 5 years \ndied from sepsis or meningitis. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in neonates after \nprematurity and birth asphyxia, both of which are associated with maternal infections such \nas chorioamnionitis (122) . Premature birth (< 37 weeks of gestation) and low birth weight \nare the main risk factors for neonatal sepsis and are associated with higher mortality. In \nearly onset sepsis, additional risk factors are: intra-amniotic infections (i.e. chorioamnionitis); \nprolonged rupture of the membranes (> 18 hours); and maternal rectovaginal colonization \nwith specific pathogens, such as group B streptococci ( Streptococcus agalactiae ). Neonates \nwith underlying disease such as congenital malformations, or those undergoing invasive \nprocedures, or those with central or peripheral catheters, or those undergoing surgical \nprocedures or those with prolonged hospital stays are also at increased risk of sepsis.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 333HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n25. Sepsis in neonates (< 28 days) and children (28 days\u201312 years)\nMost likely pathogens\nSepsis can be caused by a variety of pathogens including fungi and viruses, although it \nis most commonly caused by bacteria (268) . Differences in causative pathogens may be \npresent based on the age of the child, presence or absence of underlying comorbidities and \ntype of comorbidity, and geographical location, such as children in high-income versus low- \nand middle-income settings. Pathogens most frequently associated with sepsis in neonates \n28 days or younger are shown in Table 25.2. Pathogens most frequently associated with \nsepsis in children beyond the neonatal age are shown in Table 25.3.\nTable 25.2 \u2013 Bacteria most frequently identified in blood cultures in neonates 28 \ndays or younger with sepsis (also refer to Box 25.3 on bacteraemia)\nSetting Infection acquired in the community Infection acquired in \nhospital\nLow and \nmiddle \nincomeMost common\nEscherichia coli  (including multidrug-resistant \nstrains such as those producing ESBL)\nStaphylococcus aureus  (including MRSA)\nKlebsiella  spp. (including multidrug-resistant \nstrains)\nStreptococcus agalactiae  (group B Streptococcus )\nMore rarely \nStaphylococcus  spp. (other than Staphylococcus \naureus )\nAcinetobacter  spp. (including multidrug-\nresistant strains)\nStreptococcus pyogenes  (group A Streptococcus ) \nStreptococcus pneumoniae\nListeria monocytogenes \nHaemophilus influenzae\nGram-negative bacteria other than Escherichia \ncoli, Klebsiella  spp. and Acinetobacter  spp.\nEnterococcus  spp.\nInvasive non-typhoidal SalmonellaKlebsiella  spp. \nEscherichia coli\nAcinetobacter  spp. \n(including multidrug-\nresistant strains)\nStaphylococcus aureus  \n(including MRSA)\nGram-negative bacteria \nother than Escherichia coli  \nand Klebsiella  spp. and \nAcinetobacter  spp. \nEnterococcus  spp.\ncontinues334 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n25.

As indicated in the definition section, the distinction between neonatal sepsis acquired in the community \nand in the hospital is usually used in low- and middle-income settings, but neonatal sepsis can also be classified \nas early or late onset based on the time of onset of sepsis (counting days after delivery). The purpose of both \nclassifications is to help identify the most likely causative pathogens, however, overlap may exist in some settings; \nfor example, Acinetobacter  spp. is associated with early-onset sepsis in some settings.\nHospital-acquired infections have a higher risk of being caused by multidrug-resistant organisms.\nOnly bacteria are listed in the table.

Sepsis in neonates (< 28 days) and children (28 days\u201312 years)\nClinical presentation\nThe clinical presentation can vary according to the age of the child but usually signs \nand symptoms are non-specific. In general, to identify the underlying clinical infection, \nknowledge of local patterns of infections is helpful. Dengue and malaria related sepsis \nshould also be considered in endemic settings (269) .\nNeonates with sepsis commonly present with a combination of hyper- or \nhypothermia (temperature \u2265 38.0 \u00b0C or < 35.5 \u00b0C), severe chest indrawing, tachycardia, \npoor feeding, reduced spontaneous movements, hypotension and vomiting. More rarely \nirritability, diarrhoea, abdominal distention and/or seizures may be present. Fast breathing \nalone is not a strongly predictive sign of sepsis. \nIn children beyond neonatal age, the most frequent signs and symptoms \ninclude fever (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C), respiratory symptoms, tachycardia, acute altered mental status, \nhypotension and vomiting. \nThe presence of any danger signs of illness (Box 25.4) requires prompt referral for \nfurther evaluation.\nBox 25.4 \u2013 Danger signs of illness in newborns and young infants\nWHO recommendations in newborn health, 2017 (261) \n\u2022 stopped feeding well\n\u2022 history of convulsions\n\u2022 fast breathing \n\u2022 severe chest indrawing\n\u2022 no spontaneous movement\n\u2022 temperature > 37.5 \u00b0C or < 35.5 \u00b0C\n\u2022 any jaundice in the first 24 hours of life or yellow palms and soles at any age\nWHO pocket book of hospital care for children, 2013 (31) \n\u2022 not feeding well\n\u2022 convulsions\n\u2022 drowsy or unconscious\n\u2022 movement only when stimulated or no movement at all\n\u2022 fast breathing (60 breaths/minute)\n\u2022 grunting\n\u2022 severe chest indrawing\n\u2022 raised temperature, > 38.0 \u00b0C\n\u2022 hypothermia, < 35.5 \u00b0C\n\u2022 central cyanosisThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 337HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n25. Sepsis in neonates (< 28 days) and children (28 days\u201312 years)\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nMicrobiology tests help establish a definitive diagnosis of sepsis and identify the causative \npathogen and underlying infection. Isolating a pathogen from a normally sterile body site \n(e.g. blood, cerebrospinal fluid) that is compatible with the clinical signs and symptoms \nusually confirms diagnosis. A septic screen in young infants would normally include culture \nof blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid, and a chest X-ray may be considered.\nDiagnostic tests should be guided by the suspected primary site of infection and \nwill be different for pneumonia, meningitis or sepsis of unknown origin. Please also refer to \nspecific chapters of the AWaRe book based on the suspected underlying infection.\nTests to consider when sepsis of bacterial origin is suspected are indicated in Table \n25.4. Ideally, these tests should be done before starting antibiotic treatment, but treatment \nshould not be delayed in a very unwell child.\nTable 25.4 \u2013 Microbiology tests to consider when sepsis in suspected depending \non the most likely source of infection as indicated in the WHO EDL (6)\nSuspected \nunderlying \ninfectionaDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Settings where \nthe test should \nbe available\nAll cases \nwhere sepsis is \nsuspectedBlood culture \nand antimicrobial \nsusceptibility \ntestingTo detect bacterial \nbloodstream infectionsHealth care \nfacilities \nwith clinical \nlaboratories\nUrinary tract \ninfectionUrine culture and \nantimicrobial \nsusceptibility \ntestingInitial step to detect \nand identify bacterial \nand fungal species for \nselection of appropriate \nantimicrobial regimensHealth care \nfacilities \nwith clinical \nlaboratories\nMeningitis Cerebrospinal \nfluid: Gram stain, \nbacterial cultureb \nand antimicrobial \nsusceptibility \ntestingInitial step to detect \nand identify bacterial \nand fungal species for \nselection of appropriate \nantimicrobial regimensHealth care \nfacilities \nwith clinical \nlaboratories\ncontinues338 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n25.

Please also refer to specific chapters of the AWaRe book based \non the suspected underlying infection. When sepsis is suspected and respiratory distress is \npresent, a chest X-ray is indicated to confirm a lower respiratory tract infection that may not \nalways be clinically obvious.\nIf an abdominal source of infection is suspected, an abdominal ultrasound could \nbe considered. As an alternative and if available, a CT scan of the abdomen could also be \nconsidered; however, limiting exposure to radiation should always be considered, especially \nin young children. If sepsis caused by an infection of the urinary tract is suspected, initial \nimaging (e.g. ultrasound) of the urinary tract or during follow-up could be considered if an \noutflow obstruction or collection are suspected.\nAntibiotic treatment\nAntibiotic treatment should be started as soon as possible when sepsis is suspected. \nPerformance and results of laboratory and microbiology tests should not delay the first dose \nof antibiotic treatment.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 341HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n25. Sepsis in neonates (< 28 days) and children (28 days\u201312 years)\nEven though the presence of perinatal risk factors (prematurity, prolonged rupture \nof membranes) often leads to early empiric antibiotic use in babies, there is good evidence \nthat these risk factors alone do not reliably predict neonatal sepsis. Therefore, antibiotic \ntreatment should generally be started in newborn infants based on a combination of clinical \nand laboratory signs. In neonates with significant risk factors for infection \u2013 for example, \nmembranes ruptured > 18 hours before delivery, mother had fever \u2265 38.0 \u00b0C before delivery \nor during labour, or amniotic fluid was foul smelling or purulent \u2013 prophylactic antibiotics \n(ampicillin and gentamicin) should be given for only 2 days. The neonate should be \nreassessed after 2 days and treatment continued only if there are signs of sepsis or a positive \nblood culture (261) .\nEmpiric treatment (see Table 25.7) should always cover the most probable causative \npathogens, namely:\n\u2022 in neonates: Gram-negative bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus , Group B Streptococcus ;\n\u2022 in children beyond the neonatal age: Gram-negative bacteria, Streptococcus \npneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus  and Neisseria meningitidis .\nSimplify  empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called \nde-escalation) based on culture results if a pathogen is isolated (targeted treatment). When \nno organism is identified, antibiotic treatment should be guided by available laboratory \nresults and clinical response. Simplification of empiric antibiotic regimens for low-risk \nneonates, using two doses of parenteral gentamicin combined with oral amoxicillin, is \nbeing implemented in primary health care settings. \nIn malaria-endemic areas, in a child with shock or severe illness and decreased \nalertness, it is often difficult to differentiate between severe Plasmodium falciparum  malaria \nand invasive bacterial infection (often caused by invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella ), and \nco-infections are not uncommon. In all such cases, empiric parenteral broad-spectrum \nantibiotics should be started immediately, together with antimalarial treatment (273) .342 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n25.

Of \nnote, empiric treatment with third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone/cefotaxime) may be more appropriate \nin settings where invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella  are a major cause of bloodstream infection. The reason is \nthat (i) > 85% of non-typhoidal Salmonella  are multidrug-resistant, which includes ampicillin resistance and (ii) \naminoglycosides have reduced clinical effectiveness in invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella  infections.\nc Ceftriaxone should not be used in neonates with hyperbilirubinaemia and should not be administered with \ncalcium. Age restriction: use only in neonates of > 41 weeks corrected gestational age.\nd Cloxacillin is a useful second-choice option when an infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus  is suspected; \nthe presence of extensive skin pustules, abscess or omphalitis (i.e. infection of the umbilicus and/or surrounding \ntissues) may suggest a staphylococcal infection. Of note, in community setting with high prevalence of MRSA, \nvancomycin should be considered instead of cloxacillin. \ne If cloxacillin is unavailable, any other IV antistaphylococcal penicillin could be used. \nf Gentamicin can be used when amikacin is not available. Amikacin (or gentamicin) would mostly be used as a \ntreatment for infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria and when antibiotic-resistant bacteria are suspected. \nLegend: ACCESS antibiotics are indicated in green, WATCH antibiotics in orange and RESERVE antibiotics in red.344 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n25.

Bacterial meningitis\nPathophysiology\nThe pathogens that cause meningitis can colonize the upper respiratory tract and from \nthere invade the bloodstream and get access to the central nervous system through the \nventricular choroid plexus or can access the meninges by local spread. Because the central \nnervous system lacks effective immune defences, organisms can multiply rapidly, cause \ndirect tissue injury to the meninges and produce an inflammatory response that contributes \nto neurological symptoms.\nEpidemiology\nMeningitis is found worldwide and can affect individuals of all ages, although some \ndifferences exist across geographic regions. Mortality is highest in children younger than \n5 years. Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis mostly occurring during cooler and drier \nseasons are a serious threat, especially in the so-called meningitis belt, an area in the peri-\nSahelian African region stretching from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. Although \ndeaths from meningitis decreased overall by about 20% between 1990 and 2016 (from an \nestimated 403 000 deaths to about 318 000 a year), the burden of bacterial meningitis is still \nhigh, especially in low- and middle-income countries despite an increase in immunization \nprogrammes (278) . According to data from the Global Burden of Disease study, in 2017, \nthere were around 5 million new cases of meningitis (considering all ages and both sexes \ncombined) (44). Almost half of the cases were of viral origin (2.4 million cases). In the same \nyear, the number of new cases of acute pneumococcal (about 440 000) and meningococcal \n(about 400 000) meningitis were similar, while Haemophilus influenzae  accounted for an \nestimated 262 000 new cases (44).\nTuberculous meningitis is more common in settings with a high prevalence of TB, \nespecially among patients living with HIV. In settings where TB is endemic, children and \nyoung adults are more at risk of TB meningitis (dissemination of primary infection from the \nlungs to the central nervous system), while in setting with a low prevalence of TB, adults are \nmost at risk (reactivation of a latent TB infection) (279) .\nThe incidence and mortality of meningitis are higher in countries with limited \nresources. In 2016, > 90% of new cases of meningitis and > 80% of deaths (about 270 000 \ndeaths) occurred in countries with a low to middle socioeconomic index, as defined by the \nGlobal Burden of Disease study group (278) . In 2016, the highest mortality was reported for \ncentral and western sub-Saharan African regions, about 110 000 deaths. Nevertheless, of \nthe 10 countries with the highest absolute number of meningitis deaths in 2016, four were \nlocated outside of the meningitis belt (Afghanistan, China, India and Pakistan). About 7% of \nnew meningitis cases and 4% of deaths in 2016 occurred in countries with a high or middle-\nto-high socioeconomic index (278) .The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 351HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n26. Bacterial meningitis\nMost likely pathogens\nViral meningitis (usually benign and mainly caused by enteroviruses and arboviruses) \nand non-infectious causes (e.g. autoimmune or neoplastic diseases or as a side-effect of \ncertain medicines) can mimic the signs and symptoms of bacterial meningitis. Therefore, \nit is important to consider these causes in the differential diagnosis. The most frequently \nimplicated bacteria (beyond the neonatal age) are Streptococcus pneumoniae , Neisseria \nmeningitidis  and Haemophilus influenzae  (serotype b and non-typeable strains). The most \nlikely causative bacteria may differ across age groups (e.g. meningitis due to Haemophilus \ninfluenzae  mainly affects children) and in patients with immune system deficiencies, for \nexample, increased risk of Listeria monocytogenes , increased risk of meningitis caused by \nencapsulated bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis  and Streptococcus pneumoniae  in \npatients with asplenia or hyposplenia (Table 26.1). \nTuberculous meningitis should also be considered in the differential diagnosis \nin patients living in or coming from areas where TB is endemic, especially if the onset of \ndisease is not acute.\nIn patients with severe immunosuppression (e.g. with advanced HIV disease), \ncryptococcal meningitis and cerebral toxoplasmosis should also be considered, although \nthe clinical presentation of these two infections is usually less acute than bacterial \nmeningitis. In patients living in or visiting areas where malaria is endemic, cerebral malaria \nshould also be included in the differential diagnosis. Although most cases of meningitis \nare community-acquired, the infection can also be health care-associated (e.g. after \nneurosurgical interventions and after lumbar puncture). In that case, the most likely \npathogens are Staphylococcus aureus  or aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, including multidrug-\nresistant strains. For prevention of health care-associated meningitis refer to the WHO global \nguidance on prevention of surgical site infections (280) .352 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n26.

Bacterial meningitis\nMeningitis caused by antibiotic-resistant \npathogens\nData on the proportion of penicillin- and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant \nStreptococcus pneumoniae  isolates causing meningitis are scarce in most countries with \na high incidence of bacterial meningitis; however, whenever available, these data should \nguide empiric antibiotic treatment. Currently, because of the potential risk of penicillin-\nresistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae  isolates and because meningitis is a very serious \nand potentially fatal disease, a third-generation cephalosporin is recommended for \nempiric treatment. Isolates with intermediate or complete resistance to ceftriaxone have \nrarely been described (mainly in patients with prolonged or multiple exposures to beta-\nlactam antibiotics in the previous 3 months) and some experts suggest adding intravenous \nvancomycin or rifampicin empirically to provide effective treatment for these isolates. \nMeningitis caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria has also been reported. \nClinical presentation \nIn adults, meningitis should be suspected in the case of acute onset (< 48 hours) of:\n\u2022 fever (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C) AND/OR\n\u2022 headache and/or change in mental status and/or confusion AND/OR\n\u2022 neck stiffness.\nClinical factors to consider in diagnosing meningitis are shown in Box 26.1.\nBox 26.1 \u2013 Clinical considerations\n\u2022 All three of the classic signs and symptoms (fever, confusion and/or headache, and neck \nstiffness) are present in only around half of patients with bacterial meningitis. \n\u2022 However, 95% of adult patients usually have at least two of these symptoms and the \nabsence of all three symptoms significantly reduces the probability of meningitis (281) . \nA haemorrhagic rash may also be present, especially in cases of meningitis caused \nby Neisseria meningitidis  although such a rash is not specific for meningococcal infection. \nNotably with Streptococcus pneumoniae , foci of infection outside the central nervous system, \nsuch as otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia and endocarditis, are also often observed.\nBecause bacterial meningitis is a serious illness and clinical and epidemiological \nfeatures alone cannot always reliably differentiate bacterial and viral origin, all severe cases 354 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n26. Bacterial meningitis\nshould be treated as if they were bacterial until this has been excluded or a viral cause has \nbeen clearly identified.\nFor the diagnosis of meningitis in children and neonates, refer to the latest edition \nof the WHO Pocket book of hospital care for children (31) . In neonates, the clinical presentation \nis less typical and symptoms are usually non-specific. Neonates often present with a \ncombination of fever, poor feeding, lethargy, drowsiness, vomiting, irritability, seizures or a \nfull fontanelle. Neck stiffness is very uncommon. \nLaboratory tests\nPatient microbiology tests\nWhenever possible, certain microbiology tests should be considered (Table 26.2); ideally \nsamples should be obtained before antibiotic treatment is started. The rationale for these \ntests is to establish the diagnosis and identify the pathogen as this affects treatment.\nTable 26.2 \u2013 Microbiology tests to consider for the diagnosis of meningitis as \nindicated in the WHO EDL (6)\nDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Settings where the test should \nbe available\nBlood culturesa \nand antimicrobial \nsusceptibility testingTo detect bacterial and fungal \nbloodstream infectionsHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\nCSF microscopy \n(Gram stain)To assess microbial \nmorphology, number of white \nblood cells and red blood cellsHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\nCSF culture and \nantimicrobial \nsusceptibility testingInitial step to detect and \nidentify bacterial and fungal \nspecies for selection of \nappropriate antimicrobial \nregimensHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\nCryptococcal \nantigen test (CSF, \nblood)To screen and diagnose \ncryptococcal meningitis in \npeople living with advanced \nHIV diseaseHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories and also in \nprimary care settings\ncontinuesThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 355HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n26.

Therefore, whenever possible and if \nno contraindications are present (such as increased bleeding risk, risk of herniation or a skin \ninfection at the site of the puncture), a lumbar puncture should be done before starting \nantibiotic treatment. However, doing a lumbar puncture should never delay giving antibiotic \ntreatment when bacterial meningitis is suspected; if available at least blood cultures should \nbe taken before starting treatment. In settings where CT scanning is available, certain \npatients may benefit from a scan of the head before the lumbar puncture because of the \nrisk of cerebral herniation after removing cerebrospinal fluid at the lumbar level if elevated \nintracranial pressure is suspected. CT scanning should never delay the start of antibiotic \ntreatment. If available, imaging is indicated in patients with focal neurological signs, decreased \nlevel of consciousness or coma or a history of central nervous system disease or recent onset \nof seizures (< 1 week) or severe immunosuppression (e.g. advanced HIV disease).\nLaboratory tests to consider when meningitis is suspected are given in Table 26.3. In \nthe specific context of epidemics, also consult the WHO meningitis epidemics guidelines (257) .\nIn bacterial meningitis, the characteristics of cerebrospinal fluid vary widely (and \nmay be normal or only slightly altered in neonates); however, certain findings suggest a \nprobable bacterial cause. In particular, the following characteristics of the cerebrospinal fluid \nsuggest bacterial meningitis:\n\u2022 high opening pressure during lumbar puncture (reference range, 80\u2013200 mm \nH2O or 8\u201320 cm H2O)\n\u2022 turbid appearance of cerebrospinal fluid \n\u2022 elevated cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count (often more than several \nhundred to several thousand cells/mm3 or > 0.1 to > 1 \u00d7 109/L)356 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n26.

Bacterial meningitis\nTuberculosis meningitis\nTB meningitis should always be considered in the differential diagnosis in high-risk patients \nand in settings where TB is endemic. TB meningitis can have an acute presentation and, \nsimilar to bacterial meningitis, its diagnosis cannot be made or excluded only on the basis \nof clinical presentation. Since TB meningitis is a serious disease, prompt diagnosis and \ntreatment are essential (119) . \nUse of corticosteroids\nThe rationale for the use dexamethasone in cases of meningitis is to reduce the \ninflammatory response and the risk of neurological sequelae (e.g. hearing loss) and death. \nThe use of adjunctive steroids is suggested only in high-income settings, where it has a \nproven benefit. Current evidence has failed to show any significant benefit both in terms \nof mortality and sequelae in patients in low-income countries (283\u2013285) . In high-income \ncountries, dexamethasone can be given before or at the time of the first antibiotic dose if \nbacterial meningitis is suspected and continued if Streptococcus pneumoniae  is confirmed. \nThe recommended dose is 0.15 mg/kg of dexamethasone every 6 hours. Steroids are not \nrecommended in neonatal meningitis. \nAntibiotic treatment\nAntibiotic treatment should be started as soon as possible when bacterial meningitis is \nsuspected (Table 26.4). The first dose of antibiotic treatment should not be delayed until \nthe results of the lumbar puncture are available. The choice of empiric antibiotic treatment \nshould take into account the age of the patient, presence of immunosuppression and local \nprevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae  isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. \nThe patient risk of Listeria  meningitis should also be taken into account (e.g. pregnant women, \npatients who are immunocompromised or patients > 50 years of age) because ceftriaxone \n(and cefotaxime) do not cover this pathogen and ampicillin should be used in these cases.\nAs a general rule, empiric treatment in children other than neonates (< 1 month) \nand in adults should always cover all three of the main causative pathogens ( Haemophilus \ninfluenzae , Neisseria meningitidis  and Streptococcus pneumoniae ). \nIf a pathogen is isolated and its susceptibilities are known, antibiotics should be \nreviewed and modified accordingly. When no pathogen is identified, the duration of \nantibiotic treatment should be guided by available laboratory results and clinical response.\nStep-down  to oral treatment is less commonly used in meningitis management, \nwhere the treatment is mainly parenteral where possible to maximize penetration into the \ncerebrospinal fluid. 358 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n26.

Bacterial meningitis\nPrevention\nVaccination and post-exposure prophylaxis\nPrimary prevention of bacterial meningitis relies on vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis \nfor close contacts of cases. Vaccination is a successful intervention to prevent bacterial \nmeningitis. Available vaccines are active against meningococcal, pneumococcal and \nHaemophilus influenzae  type b disease. Vaccines are never 100% effective and they do not \nprotect against all strains of a bacterial pathogen. Duration of protection is also variable. As \na result, even vaccinated people can develop bacterial meningitis. WHO recommendations \nfor routine immunizations and the WHO roadmap towards defeating meningitis by 2030 are \navailable online (274,277) .\nMeningococcal vaccination\nAppropriate large-scale meningococcal vaccination programmes should be in place in \ncountries with a high (> 10 cases per 100 000 population/year) or intermediate (2\u201310 \ncases per 100 000 population/year) incidence of meningococcal disease or with frequent \nepidemics. In countries in the meningitis belt, all individuals aged 1\u201329 years (including \npregnant women) should be vaccinated with the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine \n(236,276) .\nIn countries with a low incidence of meningococcal disease (< 2 cases per 100 \n000 population/year), vaccination is recommended only for defined high-risk groups such \nas children and young adults or individuals with immunodeficiency. The choice of the \nrecommended vaccine depends on the local prevalence of the different meningococcal \nserogroups (276) . \nPneumococcal vaccination\nThe inclusion of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in childhood immunization programmes \nworldwide is recommended (35).\nHaemophilus influenzae  type b vaccination\nThe inclusion of Haemophilus influenzae  type b conjugate vaccines in childhood \nimmunization programmes worldwide is recommended (36).The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 361HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n26.

Community-acquired pneumonia \u2013 severe\nDefinition\nCAP is an acute illness affecting the lungs caused by pathogens, most often bacteria and \nviruses. It usually presents with cough, sputum production (in adults), rapid and difficult \nbreathing with new or worsening pulmonary infiltrate(s) on chest imaging.\nPathophysiology\nCAP occurs when microbial pathogens (usually inhaled in the upper airways) reach the \nlower respiratory tract and proliferate in the alveoli. Less frequently, these pathogens can \nalso reach the alveoli via the blood or by direct spread, for example, from an infection of the \npleural or intra-abdominal space. Once in the alveoli, host immune defences are activated \nto eliminate the pathogens. Only when these defences fail, pneumonia manifests itself \nbecause of the tissue damage and inflammatory response triggered by the proliferation of \nmicroorganisms in the affected lung(s).\nEpidemiology \nCAP is common worldwide and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with an \nespecially high burden in low-income countries (120) . According to the Global Burden of \nDisease study, in 2017, there were an estimated 471 million new cases of lower respiratory \ntract infections (including CAP) globally among all ages and sexes combined (44). However, \na majority of these cases were viral bronchitis; therefore, caution is needed in interpreting \nthis number. The incidence of CAP varies with age and a country\u2019s income level. The most \ncommon causative pathogen worldwide is Streptococcus pneumoniae  and viruses (see the \nfollowing section); viral\u2013bacterial coinfections may occur. \nIn low-income countries, lower respiratory tract infections (including CAP) were the \nleading cause of death in 2016 with a crude yearly attributable mortality of about 75 per \n100 000 population (121) . In general, the incidence of CAP is highest in children younger \nthan 5 years in these countries. In 2015, an estimated 0.9 million children younger than 5 \nyears died of pneumonia and of these, about 0.5 million occurred in sub-Saharan Africa \n(122) . Undernutrition, HIV infection, and exposure to smoke and air pollution are common \nrisk factors for severe CAP in children younger than 5 years. As a result of better access to \nmedical care, better nutrition and greater vaccination coverage, global mortality rates in \nchildren have declined by more than 30% since 2000. In high-income countries, CAP mainly \naffects adults 65 years and older and, in general, the incidence of CAP and risk of death \nincrease with age (123) . 368 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n27. Community-acquired pneumonia \u2013 severe\nMost likely pathogens\nIn neonates and children aged up to 2 months , pneumonia is mainly caused by \nStreptococcus pneumoniae , group B Streptococcus , Enterobacterales or Staphylococcus aureus . \nIn children aged 2 months to 5 years , pneumonia is more likely to be of viral \norigin (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza and parainfluenza virus). The most \nimportant bacterial pathogen in children younger than 5 years is Streptococcus pneumoniae . \nIn older children, Streptococcus pneumoniae  is still common but \u201catypical\u201d bacteria such as \nMycoplasma pneumoniae  and Chlamydia pneumoniae  may occur \u2013 atypical bacteria have \nintrinsic resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and cannot by visualized by Gram staining. \nHaemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis  and Staphylococcus aureus  also cause CAP in \nsome children (Table 27.1). \nIn adults, viruses are common causes of CAP , either by directly causing pneumonia \nor by favouring superinfection with bacteria. Among bacteria, the most common causative \nagents are Streptococcus pneumoniae , followed by atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma \npneumoniae , Chlamydia pneumoniae  and Legionella pneumophila . Haemophilus influenzae , \nMoraxella catarrhalis  and Staphylococcus aureus  are also quite common (Table 27.1). \nHowever, determining the cause of bacterial pneumonia is difficult in all age groups \nand no causative pathogen is identified in most cases, even if extensive microbiological \ntests are performed. Furthermore, there may be important geographic differences in the \ncause of pneumonia; for example, Burkholderia pseudomallei  is a cause of CAP in South-East \nAsia, while Coxiella burnetii  is more common in regions with exposure to livestock.\nNote\n\u2022 Identifying a pathogen on a specimen in the upper respiratory tract does not mean it is the \ncause of the pneumonia.\n\u2022 Nasopharyngeal carriage of bacterial pathogens is very common.\nThe type of sample (upper respiratory versus lower respiratory origin, blood cultures), \nthe test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values), the local epidemiology, \nclinical presentation and, if available, other laboratory test results always need to be \nconsidered when deciding whether a positive result for a pathogen likely identifies the \ncausative pathogen.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 369HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n27.

They also have intrinsic resistance to beta-lactams.\nb The most common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia in all age groups (beyond the first week \nof life) is Streptococcus pneumoniae .\nc Mycoplasma pneumoniae  and Chlamydia  spp. are more frequent in children > 5 years (compared with younger \nchildren) and in young adults.\nd Up to 50% of cases of pneumonia in children < 5 years are caused by a virus (most commonly respiratory syncytial virus).\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia caused by \nantibiotic-resistant pathogens\nAntimicrobial resistance is a potential problem with all pathogens associated with CAP . \nClinically relevant high-level beta-lactam resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae  is however \nstill rare globally. Resistance to macrolides in Streptococcus pneumoniae  and Mycoplasma \npneumoniae  is highly prevalent in some settings (124,125) . It is important to note that \nalso in the hospital setting, parenteral Access antibiotics such as penicillin/amoxicillin/\nampicillin achieve sufficient antibiotic exposure to treat the great majority of Streptococcus \npneumoniae  isolates.\nNote\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia caused by low-level and intermediate-level pneumococcal \npenicillin resistance can be successfully treated with higher doses of the Access antibiotics \n(amoxicillin, ampicillin or penicillin) in children and adults.370 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n27. Community-acquired pneumonia \u2013 severe\nClinical presentation\nNearly all respiratory diseases can mimic the symptoms of CAP . Based on clinical features \nalone it is often impossible to distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia or from other non-\ninfectious causes; local epidemiology and laboratory tests may help.\nWell established clinical features of CAP include a combination of: new onset \n(< 2 weeks) of symptoms, worsening cough with or without sputum production, dyspnoea \n(difficulty in breathing), tachypnoea (abnormal respiratory rates to diagnose rapid breathing \nvary with age), reduced oxygen saturation, crepitations on lung auscultation, or chest pain or \ndiscomfort without an alternative explanation. Fever \u2265 38.0 \u00b0C for 3\u20134 days is usually present \nbut may be absent, especially in elderly people. Extrapulmonary features such as confusion \nor disorientation may be the main symptoms in elderly people, immunocompromised \npatients and malnourished children. Severe pneumonia with respiratory distress and sepsis \nrequiring intensive care and intravenous antibiotic treatment has a high associated mortality.\nIn children  the WHO defines fast breathing pneumonia as a child with a high \nrespiratory rate for their age (> 50 breaths/minute in children 2\u201311 months of age; > 40 \nbreaths/minute in children aged 1\u2013 5 years). They may or may not have chest indrawing.  \nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nIn severe cases the following tests could be considered to guide antimicrobial treatment \n(Table 27.2):\n\u2022 blood cultures (ideally before starting antibiotic treatment)\n\u2022 sputum microscopy and culture (ideally before starting antibiotic treatment)\n\u2022 urinary antigens for Legionella pneumophila  and Streptococcus pneumoniae .\nAdditionally, in certain cases, the following tests could also be considered (Table 27.2):\n\u2022 rapid molecular test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis  in sputum\n\u2022 nucleic acid amplification test for influenza virus in a nasopharyngeal sample \nto help decide on antiviral treatment and for infection prevention and control \npurposes, for example, to prevent transmission to other patients\n\u2022 nucleic acid amplification test or antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 depending on the \ncurrent epidemiology\n\u2022 HIV testing in low- and middle-income countries and in case of recurrent and \nsevere pneumonia.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 371HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n27.

Furthermore, chest X-rays can be difficult to interpret, The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 375HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n27. Community-acquired pneumonia \u2013 severe\nespecially those of elderly people, and many other conditions (such as heart failure) \ncan mimic infectious infiltrates. In addition, the absence of a visible infiltrate does not \nalways rule out pneumonia (e.g. in dehydrated patients). As with any test, the pre-test \nprobability of pneumonia based on clinical picture and laboratory tests if available \nand the likelihood of alternative diagnoses need to be considered when interpreting \nchest X-rays. It should also be noted that the radiographic pattern cannot be used to \naccurately predict the microbial cause and does not reliably distinguish typical from \natypical or viral pathogens.\nScores to determine disease severity and guide \ntreatment decisions\nWHO recommends that children who meet the criteria of severe pneumonia should be \nadmitted to hospital. As a general rule for children, hospitalization is indicated in cases \nof severe illness (e.g. cough and severe respiratory distress, marked tachypnoea and \ntachycardia) and/or if the child is unable to take oral therapy. \nIn children , severe pneumonia is characterized by signs of pneumonia (fast \nbreathing with or without chest indrawing) plus a general danger sign, such as inability to \nbreastfeed or drink, convulsions, lethargy or a reduced level of consciousness (118) .\nIn adults , several scores exist that measure severity and help predict 30-day \nmortality. These scores, in addition to clinical judgement, can be used to determine the \nneed for hospitalization in immunocompetent adults diagnosed with CAP . In view of its \nsimplicity, one of the more frequently used scores is the CURB-65 (127) , or its modification, \nCRB-65, which does not require laboratory values for its calculation (Table 27.4). However, it \nshould be noted that these scores have not been extensively validated in low- and middle-\nincome countries or settings and therefore there is no clear consensus about their use \nin these settings (128) . As well as severity scores, other factors, such as severe comorbid \nillnesses (e.g. HIV infection) or inability to maintain oral therapy, should always be taken into \naccount in determining the need for hospital admission.\nTable 27.4 \u2013 CURB-65 criteria and scoring, and treatment decisions\nCriterion Points\nPresence of confusion (new onset) 1\nUrea > 19 mg/dL (or > 7 mmol/L)a1\nRespiratory rate > 30 breaths/min 1\ncontinues376 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n27.

In such cases, specific investigations for TB should \nbe done. A rapid molecular test (GeneXpert\u00ae MTB/RIF assay) performed on a single \nsputum specimen is currently the preferred first-line diagnostic test for pulmonary TB \nand to detect rifampicin resistance in both children and adults. When this rapid test is \nnot available, microscopy examination of sputum smears could be considered for the The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 377HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n27. Community-acquired pneumonia \u2013 severe\ndetection of acid-fast bacilli (129) . For TB management and treatment, refer to the WHO \nconsolidated guidelines on tuberculosis (119) .\nSymptomatic care\nPatients with severe CAP should receive appropriate oxygen therapy. Routine treatment \nwith corticosteroids is usually not needed unless otherwise indicated (287\u2013290) .\nAntibiotic treatment \nThe primary goal of empiric antibiotic treatment in CAP is to provide effective and timely \ntreatment for Streptococcus pneumoniae  infection, because this is the predominant bacterial \npathogen, and untreated pneumococcal pneumonia is associated with high mortality (see \nTable 27.5 for adults and Table 27.6 for children for treatment recommendations). While \nceftriaxone co-prescribed with clarithromycin is the first-choice recommended option, \nother less broad-spectrum options (e.g. intravenous amoxicillin or benzylpenicillin co-\nprescribed with clarithromycin) could be considered, especially in less severe cases not \nrequiring intensive care unit admission.\nEmpiric treatment should be guided by the age of the patient, severity of \nsymptoms, presence of comorbidities and previous antibiotic treatment. In certain cases \n(e.g. immunocompromised patients), the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance for common \npathogens causing CAP in the setting in which the patient is being treated could be \nconsidered. \nClinical improvement should be evident within 48\u201372 hours of starting antibiotic \ntherapy. If there is no response to treatment, a complication (such as empyema) should be \nconsidered. Duration of treatment should be guided by measures of clinical improvement \n(e.g. resolution of fever); usually 5 days of treatment are adequate for adults and 3\u20135 days \nin children.\nSimplify  empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (also called \nde-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or based on rapid clinical \nimprovement when no microbiology test results are available.\nStep-down  to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs \nof infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home \nwhen clinically appropriate.378 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n27.

Azithromycin could \nbe used as an alternative when clarithromycin is not available but there are increasing concerns about its potential \nfor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance because of its long half-life. Erythromycin could also be \nconsidered but it is associated with higher toxicity (diarrhoea is frequently associated with its use).

Available vaccines are active against \npneumococcal infection, Haemophilus influenzae  type b disease and influenza, and several \nvaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are available. Vaccines are never 100% effective and because \nthey are serogroup-specific, they do not protect against all strains of bacteria or viruses. \nDuration of protection is also variable. As a result, even vaccinated people can develop CAP . \nHaemophilus influenzae  type b conjugate vaccines and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines \nshould be included in all routine infant immunization programmes as they have been very \nsuccessful in reducing invasive disease and, in many countries, rates of pneumococcal \nresistance. Countries should consider the inclusion of yearly seasonal influenza vaccination \nfor high-risk populations (pregnant women, elderly people, patients with chronic medical \nconditions and health care workers) in their vaccination plan.  The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 381HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n28. Hospital-acquired pneumonia\nKey messages\n\u2022 Antibiotic-resistant pathogens are more frequent in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) \nthan in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The frequency of multidrug-resistant \npathogens as causes of HAP varies by setting (e.g. among different regions, or within a \nhospital) and this has implications for empiric guidance.\n\u2022 HAP in ventilated patients \u2013 called ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) \u2013 is a special \nsubtype of HAP with higher frequency of multidrug-resistant pathogens. It is not addressed \nspecifically in this chapter.\n\u2022 Risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens (e.g. longer hospital stay, previous \ncolonization and antibiotic use) need to be considered when choosing empiric treatment.\n\u2022 In people with HAP (and VAP), the respiratory tract is often colonized with bacteria and a \npositive culture may not indicate an acute infection.\n\u2022 Potential overtreatment of HAP with broad-spectrum antibiotics of the Watch and Reserve \ngroups should be avoided when possible, particularly in non-ventilated patients.\nOther relevant WHO resources (please check regularly for updates)\n\u2022 Pocket book of hospital care for children: guidelines for the management of common \nchildhood illnesses, 2013 (31).\nDefinition\nHospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is an acute illness affecting the lungs caused by \npathogens present in the hospital setting and presenting 48 hours or more after admission. \nIf pneumonia develops while the patient is on a ventilator, HAP is also called ventilator-\nassociated pneumonia (VAP). Of note, the cut-off of 48 hours after admission is chosen for \nconvenience and surveillance purposes. Depending on the situation (particularly in non-\nventilated patients), even pneumonias occurring several days to weeks after hospitalization \ncan be caused by pathogens known to cause CAP , while nosocomial pathogens can be \nacquired and cause infection in patients hospitalized for fewer than 48 hours.382\nThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n28.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia\nPathophysiology\nColonization of the oropharynx by bacteria from the hospital environment, aspiration of \nsecretions into the lower respiratory tract and compromised host defence mechanisms are \nall implicated in the pathogenesis of HAP . Pathogens can also reach the lung alveoli through \nthe blood or by direct spread (e.g. from an infection of the pleural or intra-abdominal space). \nSecretions may become contaminated with bacteria (including with multidrug-resistant \nstrains) during patient care despite infection prevention and control efforts. Inhalation of \npathogens (mostly viruses) is another mechanism of infection to consider, especially during \nepidemic seasons or during pandemics such as COVID-19.\nThe presence of an endotracheal tube is a major risk factor for pneumonia (VAP) \nbecause the mechanisms that usually prevent the microaspiration of secretions into the \nlower respiratory tract are bypassed and also because biofilms (where bacteria can survive \nand multiply) can form on the internal and external surfaces of the tracheal cannula. \nEpidemiology \nHealth care-associated infections are frequent across the world \u2013 around a quarter of all \nhospital antibiotic prescriptions were for health care-associated infections in a 2015 global \nsurvey in more than 50 countries (291)  and HAP is an important health care-associated \ninfection. The incidence of HAP can vary between hospitals, depending on the patient \npopulation being evaluated and the case definition used. However, the incidence is overall \nhigher in mechanically ventilated patients treated in intensive care units than in non-\nventilated patients not requiring intensive care (292) . \nRisk factors for HAP in non-ventilated patients include: (i) patient-related \nfactors such as swallowing dysfunction and severe underlying medical conditions (e.g. \nimmunosuppression, chronic lung disease); and (ii) treatment-related factors such as \nmechanical ventilation (for VAP) and feeding through a nasogastric tube, because their \npresence can lead to aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions into the lower respiratory \ntract. These conditions are particularly common in elderly and frail patients (293) . HAP is \nassociated with higher in-hospital mortality than CAP , and VAP is the form of HAP with the \nhighest mortality (293,294) .\nMost likely pathogens\nHAP may be caused by the same pathogens found in CAP or by multidrug-resistant \npathogens (Table 28.1). In general antibiotic resistance is more prevalent in hospital-\nacquired strains but the frequency of multidrug-resistant pathogens varies between \nhospitals and different patient populations. Usually, the risk of infection with multidrug-The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 387HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n28. Hospital-acquired pneumonia\nresistant pathogens is increased in patients with HAP because they have often been \nexposed to different regimens of antibiotics before developing HAP . The risk increases with \nprolonged hospitalization (higher risk of transmission, more antibiotic use) especially if in \na critical care setting and in intubated patients. It is important to note that most data on \nthe microbiological etiology of HAP come from ventilated patients in an intensive care \nsetting because samples from the lower respiratory tract can be relatively easily obtained. \nIn contrast, in non-ventilated patients, bronchoalveolar lavage is associated with a risk of \nrespiratory deterioration and non-invasive sampling techniques are often not sufficient to \nobtain an accurate microbiological diagnosis of etiologic agents in pneumonia.\nTable 28.1 \u2013 Pathogens most frequently associated with hospital-acquired \npneumonia (in descending order of frequency)\nBacteria Viruses Fungi\nGram-negative bacteria including \nPseudomonas aeruginosa , Acinetobacter \nbaumannii  and Enterobacterales \nsuch as Klebsiella pneumoniae  \n(including multidrug-resistant strains \nsuch as those producing ESBL and \ncarbapenemases)\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\nHaemophilus influenzae\nStaphylococcus aureus  (including MRSA)\nAnaerobes (mostly associated with \naspiration of a large amount of \nsecretions)\nLegionella pneumophilaInfluenza virus (A and B)\nOther respiratory viruses \n(including SARS-CoV-2)Mostly Aspergillus  \nspp. in severely \nimmunocompromised \npatients or ventilated \npatients with influenza\nESBL: extended spectrum beta-lactamase; MRSA: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ; SARS-CoV-2: severe \nacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nClinical presentation\nThe clinical manifestations are the same as in all other forms of pneumonia: new or worsening \ncough with or without sputum production, dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing), tachypnoea \n(cut-off points for rapid breathing vary with age), reduced oxygen saturation, crepitations \non lung auscultation, or chest pain or discomfort without an alternative explanation. Fever \n\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C is usually present but may be absent, especially in elderly people.\nIn ventilated patients, pneumonia is usually suspected in those with increased \nsecretions, reduced oxygen saturation and a new lung infiltrate on a chest X-ray.388 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n28. Hospital-acquired pneumonia\nHAP and VAP may progress to sepsis and septic shock. Please refer to the sepsis \nchapter if this is suspected.\nIt is important to note that accurate diagnosis of HAP is difficult in the absence \nof a good reference standard. Pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray may be caused by a \nvariety of non-infectious conditions and the clinical presentation may be very non-specific. \nThere is considerable interobserver variability among specialists in the diagnosis of HAP . It \nis important to consider the possibility of over diagnosis of HAP and think about stopping \nantibiotic treatment if HAP is ruled out or an alternative diagnosis can be made.\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nTests to be considered to guide antimicrobial treatment of HAP are shown in Table 28.2.\nHowever, most patients will not have culture data to guide antibiotic treatment. \nIn addition, in people with HAP , the respiratory tract is often colonized with bacteria and a \npositive culture may indicate colonization rather than an acute infection, especially if the \nsample was obtained by non-invasive methods.\nTable 28.2 \u2013 Microbiology tests to consider if hospital-acquired pneumonia is \nsuspected as indicated in the WHO EDL (6)\nDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Settings where the test \nshould be available\nBlood cultures \nand antimicrobial \nsusceptibility testingTo detect bacterial bloodstream \ninfectionHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\nRespiratory sample \nmicroscopya (Gram \nstain)To assess microbial morphology \nand adequacy of the specimen \nfor culture by identifying white \nblood cells and squamous \nepithelial cellsHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\nRespiratory \nsample culturea \nand antimicrobial \nsusceptibility testingInitial step to detect and \nidentify bacterial and fungal \nspecies for selection of \nappropriate antimicrobial \nregimensHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\ncontinuesThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 389HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n28.

Therefore, empiric guidance \ngiven by the AWaRe book could be reviewed and adapted based on local clinically relevant \nmicrobiology surveillance data. \nHowever, clinically relevant data for this infection would be derived from local \nhospital blood culture and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cultures taken from patients \nin intensive care who were diagnosed with HAP or VAP . Caution should be taken with \nsurveillance of routine respiratory sampling culture data from patients with HAP or VAP due \nto the high rates of colonization seen in many settings.\nImaging\nWhen HAP (or VAP) is suspected clinically, a chest X-ray should be obtained. HAP (or VAP) \npresents with clinical signs and symptoms along with a new or worsening pulmonary \ninfiltrate on a chest X-ray and leukocytosis.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 391HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n28. Hospital-acquired pneumonia\nA chest X-ray is needed because other conditions have similar clinical features and \nantibiotics may be avoided if the chest X-ray does not suggest bacterial pneumonia. Chest \nX-rays can be difficult to interpret and to correlate with the clinical presentation (especially \nin elderly people where the clinical presentation is usually non-specific), and many other \nconditions (such as heart failure) can mimic infectious infiltrates. Therefore, caution is \nwarranted to avoid over-diagnosis and overtreatment with antibiotics. It should also be noted \nthat the radiographic pattern cannot be used to accurately predict the microbial etiology.\nAntibiotic treatment \nEmpiric treatment should be guided by the severity of symptoms (scoring systems to \nevaluate disease severity exist but they are beyond the scope of this chapter) and by risk \nfactors for multidrug-resistant infections. In particular, individualized assessment should \nbe done based on risk factors such as: previous antibiotic treatment (e.g. in the 90 days \npreceding the infection); prolonged hospital stay, particularly in the intensive care unit (> 5 \ndays); previous colonization with multidrug-resistant pathogens; and a high local prevalence \nof multidrug-resistant pathogens (among potential causative pathogens of HAP , such as \nStaphylococcus aureus  and Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa ).\nAntibiotic options to consider for empiric treatment in patients with HAP (non-VAP) \nare given in Table 28.4. Treatment should always be tailored to culture results once these \nbecome available.\nEmpiric treatment in patients with VAP should be chosen considering the time from \nintensive care unit admission/intubation to symptom onset. In ventilated patients (as with \nnon-ventilated patients who develop HAP), infections that develop early (e.g. a few days \nafter admission) are unlikely to be caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens or Pseudomonas \naeruginosa  and could safely be treated with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. At the other end, an \nantibiotic with a broader spectrum of activity (and active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ) \nis preferable in cases with a longer time interval between admission to hospital and onset \nof symptoms.\nThere are some areas of uncertainty about empiric treatment for HAP .\n\u2022 Adding vancomycin to the first-choice antibiotic options as an empiric treatment \nwhen MRSA infection is suspected; for example, in settings with a high prevalence \nof Staphylococcus aureus  isolates that are methicillin resistant and in patients \nknown to be colonized by MRSA.\n\u2022 The need for empiric double coverage against Pseudomonas  to improve coverage \nin severely ill patients (e.g. with septic shock or in need of ventilator support) \nbecause of the risk of infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa  isolates \nresistant to an antibiotic used for monotherapy.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia\ncoverage could therefore be considered in severely ill patients with VAP (or with \nsevere HAP requiring ventilator support) on a case-by-case basis based on local \nantibiotic resistance data and the personal history of the patient, such as known \nrespiratory colonization with multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa , \nparticularly in patients with underlying chronic lung disease. However, specific \nantibiotic combinations to use in these cases are not covered in the AWaRe book \nas they are currently not included in the EML and EMLc with which this book is \nclosely aligned.\nSimplify  empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called \nde-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or based on rapid clinical \nimprovement when no microbiology test results are available.\nStep-down  to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs \nof infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home \nwhen clinically appropriate.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 393HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n28.

Some measures such as vaccination against \npathogens that can commonly cause pneumonia overlap with those presented in the \nchapter on CAP . Specific measures that apply to the hospital setting include: maintaining \nmobility, good oral and dental care, maintaining adequate nutritional support in hospital, \nelevating the head of the bed to reduce the chances of aspirating respiratory secretions \ninto the lower lungs, avoiding intubation or reducing its duration as much as possible, and \ngood hand hygiene. Good hand hygiene applies to patients and staff or family caregivers \nthat come into contact with patients during the hospital stay. In addition, in the intensive \ncare unit, locally adapted bundles of interventions to prevent VAP are usually in place and \ninclude, for example, maintaining adequate endotracheal tube cuff pressure, minimizing \nsedation and assessing regularly if the endotracheal tube can be removed in order to \nextubate patients as soon as it is safe to do so.\nSelective oral decontamination and/or selective decontamination of the digestive \ntract can also be considered based on local intensive care unit protocols. These preventive \nmeasures have been extensively studied to prevent hospital-acquired infections. The The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 395HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n28.

Intra-abdominal infections \u2013 acute cholecystitis and cholangitis\nPathophysiology\nIn acute cholecystitis, a gallstone obstructing the cystic duct for prolonged periods of time \nand causing inflammation of the gallbladder is the most frequent cause (> 90%). Acalculous \ncholecystitis, where there is no evidence of gallstones or cystic duct obstruction, is \nuncommon, especially in adults. Rarely, certain parasites (e.g. the worm Ascaris lumbricoides ) \ncan also cause gallbladder perforation.\nIn acute cholangitis, the most common cause is choledocholithiasis (i.e. gallstones in \nthe bile duct). Infection occurs when bacteria travel up the biliary tract from the intestine or \nvia the portal venous system. Another cause may be obstruction by tumours (e.g. pancreatic \ncancer) or parasites (e.g. the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica ) (295) . In addition, congenital biliary \nstrictures or strictures following inflammation or infection can cause acute cholangitis.\nIn both cholecystitis and cholangitis, if bacterial contamination or chemical irritation \n(usually due to leakage of sterile fluids that are irritants to the peritoneum, for example, bile \nor blood) of the peritoneal cavity occur, peritonitis develops. Abdominal abscesses (i.e. the \npresence of a collection of infected fluid in the peritoneal cavity) can also form as a result of \na complicated infection. \nEpidemiology \nAcute cholecystitis is a common surgical emergency worldwide. The incidence of acute \ncholecystitis is declining where cholecystectomy (surgical removal of the gallbladder) has \nbecome a common procedure in cases of recurrent attacks of biliary colic, that is, intermittent \npain in the upper abdomen, usually on the right side. Acute cholecystitis mostly affects \nadults; children are rarely affected. The disease is more prevalent in men and elderly people. \nObesity and diabetes are also well known risk factors (296,297) . Short-term 30-day mortality \nis about 5% in severe cases and 1% in mild cases (298) .\nAcute cholangitis is a condition associated with high mortality if left untreated. \nCholedocholithiasis and malignant obstruction by tumours are the most common causes of \ncholangitis and their risk factors overlap (299) .\nMost likely pathogens\nThe most common pathogens involved in acute cholecystitis or cholangitis are Gram-\nnegative bacilli and anaerobic bacteria from the intestinal microbiota (Table 29.1). Infections \nare often caused by more than one pathogen and may include fungal pathogens, especially \nin patients who have recently received antibiotic treatment. Certain parasites ( Ascaris \nlumbricoides , Fasciola hepatica ) need to be considered in endemic settings as they may \ncause biliary obstruction leading to bacterial complications.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 403HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n29.

Severe pain, diffuse rebound tenderness on sudden release of pressure on the \nabdomen and abdominal muscular defence are usually present in cases of peritonitis. \nHypotension and signs of organ hypoperfusion (e.g. reduced urine output) may be present \nin cases of organ failure and are a medical and/or surgical emergency. Please also refer to \nthe chapter on sepsis if suspected.\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nIn mild cases, routine microbiology tests are not usually needed and basing antibiotic \ntreatment on pathogens cultured from the abdominal cavity at the time of operation is not \nrecommended. Blood cultures and other microbiology tests could be considered in severely \nill patients in order to adjust empiric antibiotic treatment once the results of susceptibility \ntests are available (see Table 29.2).404 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n29.

For example, clinically relevant \nisolates for this infection would be blood culture data from patients on surgical wards with \nintra-abdominal infections. \nImaging\nImaging is helpful to confirm cholecystitis and cholangitis. An abdominal ultrasound should \nalways be considered when these conditions are suspected. Where available, a CT scan of \nthe abdomen may also be considered, especially if complications are suspected or the \ndiagnosis is uncertain. \nTreatment of acute cholecystitis\nPatients with suspected or confirmed acute cholecystitis should be promptly referred for \nsurgical consultation. Eliminating the source of infection and the ongoing contamination of \nthe peritoneal cavity (e.g. in case of perforation) is the most important surgical intervention. \nCholecystectomy (i.e. removal of the gallbladder) is the only definitive treatment and \nan antibiotic should be given until the gallbladder is removed (300) . After surgery, in \nuncomplicated cases, antibiotic treatment can be stopped provided the source of infection \nwas adequately controlled and there is good clinical recovery. In severe cases (i.e. critically \nill patients), 5 days of antibiotic treatment are usually adequate, provided there is good \nclinical recovery and the source of infection was adequately controlled and eliminated with \nsurgery (301) .406 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n29. Intra-abdominal infections \u2013 acute cholecystitis and cholangitis\nTreatment of acute cholangitis\nBiliary drainage is the main surgical intervention for acute cholangitis and antibiotic \ntreatment should be given in all cases irrespective of severity. Antibiotic treatment should \nbe given until drainage procedures are done and continued for a total of 5 days once control \nof the source of infection has been achieved (301) . Shorter courses of antibiotics (e.g. 3 \ndays) have been evaluated in observational studies (and in a systematic review) and were \nnot associated with a higher occurrence of complications; however, this practice remains \ncontroversial because the evidence is not strong (302,303) . \nAntibiotic treatment\nEmpiric antibiotic treatment should be chosen based on the severity of symptoms, mild \nor severe (Table 29.4), considering local prevalence of resistance, particularly isolates \nproducing ESBLs since the prevalence can vary greatly in different settings (304) . Individual \nrisk factors for resistant pathogens (e.g. recent antibiotic treatment, colonization with \nresistant pathogens) should also be considered. \nSimplify  empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called \nde-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or based on rapid clinical \nimprovement when no microbiology test results are available.\nStep-down  to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs \nof infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home \nwhen clinically appropriate.\nIf signs and symptoms persist, abdominal imaging is suggested, or an alternative \nextra-abdominal source of infection should be considered.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 407HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n29.

Intra-abdominal infections \u2013 pyogenic liver abscess\nPathophysiology\nA pyogenic liver abscess develops when a biliary infection spreads directly to the liver \nor when a complicated intra-abdominal infection spreads to the liver via the portal \ncirculation. In cases of systemic infection, the infection may also spread to the liver via \nthe bloodstream.\nEpidemiology\nPyogenic liver abscess is the most common type of visceral abscess (305) . It is frequently \nassociated with male sex and diabetes. Pyogenic liver abscess is more common in \nSouth-East Asia (306)  probably due to the different epidemiology of certain causative \npathogens, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae . Underlying hepatobiliary or pancreatic diseases \n(e.g. malignancy, cirrhosis, recent abdominal or biliary surgery) are common risk factors. \nAbscess rupture is a rare but severe complication associated with a high mortality if not \ntreated immediately.\nMost likely pathogens\nMost cases of liver abscess are caused by enteric Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes \nand most cases involve more than one pathogen (Table 30.1) (307) . A hypervirulent \nstrain of Klebsiella pneumoniae  is an increasingly common cause of liver abscess in Asia \n(308,309) . Burkholderia pseudomallei  (a Gram-negative bacterium found in soil and water \nand transmitted by inhalation or ingestion or inoculation) is also a cause of liver abscess in \nendemic countries, mostly in South-East Asia and in Australia.\nParasites, notably Entamoeba histolytica  (acquired by ingestion of contaminated \nfood or water), are another frequent cause of liver abscess in endemic settings: Indian \nsubcontinent, Africa, and Central and South America (310,311) .The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 421HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n30. Intra-abdominal infections \u2013 pyogenic liver abscess\nTable 30.1 \u2013 Pathogens most frequently associated with liver abscess (in \ndescending order of frequency)\nBacteria Parasites Fungi\nEnterobacterales (mostly Escherichia \ncoli, Klebsiella pneumoniaea, Enterobacter  \nspp.) including multidrug-resistant \nstrains such as those producing ESBL and \ncarbapenemases\nStaphylococcus  spp.\nStreptococcus  spp. (e.g. of the Streptococcus \nanginosus  group \u2013 old name: Streptococcus \nmilleri ) \nEnterococcus  spp. \nAnaerobes (mostly Bacteroides  spp.)\nIn endemic settings consider\nBurkholderia pseudomalleibEntamoeba \nhistolyticac Candida  spp.d\nESBL: extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.\na In Asia, Klebsiella pneumoniae  is currently the main cause of liver abscess.\nb Burkholderia pseudomallei  is an important cause of liver abscess in South-East Asia and northern Australia.\nc This pathogen is not a cause of pyogenic abscess but needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis, \nespecially in patients who live in or have travelled to settings where Entamoeba histolytica  is endemic.\nd This pathogen is not a cause of pyogenic abscess and is infrequent in immunocompetent individuals but should \nbe considered in the context of immunosuppression. Often it is in combination with bacteria.\nClinical presentation\nPyogenic liver abscess should be considered in all cases of fever (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C) and abdominal \npain, mostly localized in the right upper abdominal quadrant. Vomiting, nausea, anorexia, \nmalaise and jaundice are other common symptoms.\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nWhenever possible, a microbiology sample should be obtained (see Table 30.2) to guide \nantibiotic treatment. Ideally, the sample should be obtained before antibiotic treatment \nis started. The reason for doing microbiology tests is to determine the type of pathogen \ncausing infection and its resistance profile in order to provide adequate treatment (312) .422 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n30.

However, patients with amoebic liver abscess usually have no \nbowel symptoms; therefore, stool testing (microscopy or antigen) has a low sensitivity and is of limited usefulness \nfor diagnosis.\nb Antigen or nucleic acid amplification testing of abscess aspirate material for Entamoeba histolytica  could be \nconsidered where available. Diagnosis is often difficult in low- and middle-income countries due to limited \nlaboratory resources and the fact that most patients present after a failed course of antibiotic treatment for \npyogenic abscess; therefore the yield of any microbiology tests is lower (311,312) .\nc This test is not in the WHO EDL (6).\nd Serology is a useful test in the diagnosis of invasive amoebiasis and is positive in more than 90% of patients with \nthe disease. A positive serology combined with a compatible clinical presentation suggests active disease. However, \nin endemic settings, a positive result is more difficult to interpret since serology can remain positive for months and \neven years after resolution of the infection. Therefore, past and current infections become difficult to distinguish. With \nnegative results, if the clinical suspicion of invasive amoebiasis is still strong, serology could be repeated after 1 week.\nOther tests\nLaboratory tests can be used to complement the clinical examination and medical history even \nthough they are not specific for the diagnosis. Table 30.3 indicates tests that could be considered \nin the patient\u2019s initial assessment.

These tests are also assumed to be available at health care facilities with laboratories.\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nThere is no role for routine surveillance to inform empiric guidance. \nImaging\nImaging is very helpful in the diagnosis of pyogenic liver abscess. An abdominal ultrasound \nshould always be considered when this condition is suspected. In settings where it is \navailable, a CT scan of the abdomen may also be considered, especially if complications are \nsuspected or the diagnosis is uncertain. \nTreatment\nEarly control of the source of infection through drainage of the abscess is usually required \nwhen feasible in addition to antibiotic treatment, especially for large (> 5 cm) abscesses. \nDrainage is recommended because larger abscesses have a higher risk of rupture.  424 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n30. Intra-abdominal infections \u2013 pyogenic liver abscess\nDrainage techniques include:\n\u2022 Percutaneous drainage (image-guided procedure that is usually performed by an \ninterventional radiologist where available). A drain \u2013 usually a pigtail catheter \u2013 is \ninserted through the skin into the abscess and left in place until the collection is \ndrained. \n\u2022 Surgical drainage. This is done either as a conventional open procedure (i.e. \nlaparotomy) or by laparoscopy.\nIn both cases, the drainage procedure is also important for diagnostic purposes \nto identify the type of pathogen causing the abscess and its resistance profile. Abscess \nmaterial should therefore be obtained for culture when the drain is placed or the abscess \nis surgically removed.\nAntibiotic treatment\nIn patients who are clinically stable, targeted treatment based on the results of microbiology \ntests is always preferred. In particular, infections caused by Enterobacterales producing ESBL \nor carbapenemases need to be considered in patients with history of hospitalization or \npreviously colonized or infected with these resistant pathogens as their prevalence varies \ngreatly in different settings.\nIn more severe cases, empiric treatment is given, taking into account the most \nprobable type of causative pathogen (including the possibility of Entamoeba histolytica  \ninfection) and local prevalence of resistance, especially for ESBL- and carbapenemase-\nproducing isolates (see Table 30.4). Individual risk factors for resistant pathogens (e.g. \nrecent antibiotic treatment, colonization or previous infections with resistant isolates) \nshould also considered. \nThe total duration of treatment is usually long (weeks) and depends on whether \ncontrol of the source of infection is achieved and on the causative pathogen. Therefore, \nearly control of the source of infection and identification of the causative pathogen are \nencouraged. In most cases, at least 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment are needed with follow-\nup imaging (if available) to monitor response and define treatment duration.\nLonger duration of treatment is required in cases of liver abscess caused by \nBurkholderia pseudomallei  \u2013 usually 2 weeks of intravenous treatment followed by > 3 \nmonths of oral treatment with sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim to eradicate the infection \nand prevent relapse or recurrence. In cases of amoebic liver abscess, a 10-day course of \ntreatment (with oral metronidazole) is usually adequate.\nSimplify  empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called \nde-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or based on rapid clinical The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 425HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n30. Intra-abdominal infections \u2013 pyogenic liver abscess\nimprovement when no microbiology test results are available. In general, the intravenous \nroute is preferred for the initial phase of treatment.\nStep-down  to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs \nof infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home \nwhen clinically appropriate.\nOral step-down therapy can be considered quickly for mild cases after adequate \ndrainage and confirmed microbiology and susceptibility.\nIf signs and symptoms persist, abdominal imaging is suggested, or an alternative \nextra-abdominal source of infection should be considered.426 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n30.

Empiric use of a Reserve antibiotic could be considered exceptionally in very select cases of seriously ill patients failing to respond \nto carbapenems or who have previously been treated for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant pathogens or who are known to be colonized with multidrug-\nresistant Gram-negative bacteria known to be susceptible to the selected Reserve antibiotic. Please refer to the chapter on Reserve antibiotics for the definition and list of \nReserve antibiotics included in the EML and EMLc.

It is usually classified as uncomplicated (or simple) when there is no \ninvolvement of the peritoneal cavity and no abscess.

Intra-abdominal infections \u2013 acute appendicitis\nPathophysiology\nThe exact mechanism leading to appendicitis is poorly understood. Conditions associated \nwith a higher risk of weakening and disrupting the normal anatomical barrier of the \nappendix or that can cause its luminal obstruction could be involved. In children, lymphoid \nhyperplasia can contribute to the risk of developing appendicitis. Rarely, parasitic infections \n(mostly Enterobius vermicularis  (pinworm)) can contribute to the development of acute \nappendicitis (313) .\nPerforation is usually the result of gangrene and a necrotic process and can lead to \nlocalized abscess formation or to peritonitis when the leak is not contained by structures \nsurrounding the appendix.\nEpidemiology \nAcute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency worldwide, especially in children and \nyoung adults. The yearly incidence of appendicitis has been declining in western European \nand North American countries since the 1990s and has stabilized in the past 20 years to \nabout 100\u2013150 cases per 100 000 person-years. However, increasing trends are reported \nin Asia, South America and the Middle East with the incidence of appendicitis higher than \nin many western European and North American countries (314) . In 2017, there were an \nestimated 19 million new cases worldwide (44). The lifetime risk of appendicitis reported \nin the literature varies across countries, ranging from about 2% in Africa to 16% in South \nKorea (315) . Mortality attributable to appendicitis has declined and with prompt diagnosis \nand management, mortality is now < 1% in uncomplicated cases in most settings (316) . \nComplicated cases or cases in elderly people are associated with a higher mortality.\nMost likely pathogens\nThe most common pathogens involved in appendicitis are Gram-negative bacilli and \nanaerobes from the intestinal microbiota (Table 31.1). Infections are often caused by more \nthan one pathogen and may include fungal pathogens, especially in patients who have \nrecently received antibiotic treatment. Certain parasites need to be considered in the \ndifferential diagnosis of abdominal pain in endemic settings.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 441HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n31.

Nausea and vomiting are usually present. \nFever (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C) and rigors can be present. \nSevere pain, diffuse rebound tenderness on sudden release of pressure on the \nabdomen and abdominal muscular tensing are usually present in cases of peritonitis. \nHypotension and signs of organ hypoperfusion (e.g. reduced urine output) may be present \nin cases of organ failure and are a medical and/or surgical emergency. Please also refer to \nthe chapter on sepsis if suspected. \nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nRoutine microbiology tests are not usually needed and basing antibiotic treatment on \npathogens cultured from the abdominal cavity at the time of operation is not recommended. \nHowever, certain microbiology tests could be considered in severely ill patients to adjust \nempiric antibiotic treatment once the results of antibiotic susceptibility tests are available \n(Table 31.2).\nIn more severe cases, blood cultures should be taken and samples from the \nabdominal cavity may be useful in certain situations such as severely immunocompromised 442 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n31.

For example, clinically relevant \nisolates for this infection would be blood culture data from patients on surgical wards with \nintra-abdominal infections. \nImaging\nImaging is helpful to confirm acute appendicitis. An abdominal ultrasound should always be \nconsidered when this condition is suspected. Where available a CT scan of the abdomen may \nalso be considered, especially if complications are suspected or the diagnosis is uncertain.  \nTreatment\nSurgery to eliminate/control the source of infection (e.g. abscess, perforated appendix) and \nreduce contamination of the peritoneal cavity (e.g. in cases of perforation) are the foundation \nof treatment. Patients with suspected or confirmed appendicitis should be promptly referred \nfor surgical consultation and antibiotic treatment should be started quickly.\nUncomplicated cases treated with antibiotics alone \nTreating appendicitis with antibiotics alone is controversial \u2013 and not recommended by \nWHO for children \u2013 mostly because of the higher risk of recurrences within a year (317\u2013319) . 444 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n31. Intra-abdominal infections \u2013 acute appendicitis\nHowever, this approach can be considered in adults in certain cases if close monitoring \nis possible, given that one in three patients treated this way will experience a recurrence \nwithin 2 years (320) . Patient preference should be one element considered when deciding \nthe approach, that is, avoidance of surgery versus higher risk of recurrence with antibiotics.\nWhen antibiotic treatment alone is offered, the suggested duration of treatment \nis 7 days provided there is a good clinical response with resolution of symptoms. Patients \nshould be re-evaluated to assess the need for surgical intervention if they do not improve \non antibiotics alone.\nAs stated above, in children with acute appendicitis, WHO discourages this approach \nin the Pocket book of hospital care for children : \u201cappendectomy should be done as soon as \npossible to prevent perforation, peritonitis and abscess formation. It is better to operate and \nbe wrong about the diagnosis than to delay and have peritonitis occur\u201d (31).\nAntibiotic treatment\nIn general, empiric antibiotic treatment should be chosen based on the severity of symptoms \n(mild or severe), considering local prevalence of resistance, particularly isolates producing \nESBLs, since prevalence can vary greatly among different settings (Table 31.5). Individual risk \nfactors for resistant pathogens (e.g. recent antibiotic treatment, colonization with resistant \npathogens) could also be considered. \nSimplify  empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called \nde-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or based on rapid clinical \nimprovement when no microbiology test results are available. It should be noted that \nanaerobes are difficult to culture and anaerobic coverage should usually be continued even \nif no anaerobes are detected in microbiologic samples.\nStep-down  to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs \nof infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home \nwhen clinically appropriate.\nIf signs and symptoms persist, abdominal imaging is suggested, or an alternative \nextra-abdominal source of infection should be considered.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 445HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n31.

Intra-abdominal infections \u2013 acute diverticulitis\nPathophysiology\nIn cases of acute diverticulitis, the first step in the pathogenesis is the formation of diverticula \n(i.e. diverticulosis). Diverticula are sac-like protrusions of the colonic wall. The mechanism \nleading to diverticulitis of the colon is the erosion of the wall of the diverticula by increased \nintraluminal pressure. If bacterial contamination and chemical irritation (usually due to \nleakage of sterile fluids that are irritants to the peritoneum; for example, bile or blood) \nof the peritoneal cavity occur, peritonitis develops. Intra-abdominal abscesses (i.e. the \npresence of a collection of infected fluid in the peritoneal cavity) can also form as a result of \na complicated diverticulitis.\nEpidemiology \nAcute diverticulitis is common in high-income countries and mostly affects adults older \nthan 50 years; its incidence increases with age. The condition is less frequent in many \nlow- and middle-income countries, probably because of differences in the fibre content of \ndiets. The overall risk of developing acute diverticulitis in patients with diverticulosis is low \n(324,325)  and most cases (> 80%) are uncomplicated. Nonetheless, acute diverticulitis is still \na common cause of colonic resection (326) .\nMost likely pathogens\nThe most common pathogens involved in acute diverticulitis are Gram-negative bacilli and \nanaerobic bacteria from the intestinal microbiota (Table 32.1). Infections are often caused \nby more than one pathogen and may include fungal pathogens, especially in patients pre-\ntreated with antibiotics. Certain parasites need to be considered in the differential diagnosis \nof abdominal pain in endemic settings.458 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n32.

It should be noted that while left lower diverticulitis is \nmore prevalent in European countries and North America, right lower diverticulitis is more \ncommon in Asia.\nFever (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C), chills, nausea and vomiting may be present, mostly in complicated \ndiverticulitis. Severe pain, diffuse rebound tenderness on sudden release of pressure on \nthe abdomen and abdominal muscular defence are usually present in cases of peritonitis. \nHypotension and signs of organ hypoperfusion (e.g. reduced urine output) can be present \nin cases of organ failure and are a medical and /or surgical emergency. Please also refer to \nthe chapter on sepsis if suspected.\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nIn mild cases, routine microbiology tests are not usually needed and basing antibiotic \ntreatment on pathogens cultured from the abdominal cavity at the time of operation is not \nrecommended. Certain microbiology tests (Table 32.2) could be considered in severely ill \npatients to adjust empiric antibiotic treatment once the results of antibiotic susceptibility \ntests are available.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 459HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n32.

Intra-abdominal infections \u2013 acute diverticulitis\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nRoutine surveillance of pathogens cultured from the abdominal cavity is not recommended.\nEmpiric guidance given by the AWaRe book could be reviewed and adapted based \non local clinically relevant microbiology surveillance data. For example, clinically relevant \nisolates for this infection would be blood culture data from patients on surgical wards with \nintra-abdominal infections. \nImaging\nImaging is helpful to confirm acute diverticulitis. In settings where CT scanning is available, \na scan of the abdomen is the best imaging method to confirm acute diverticulitis and grade \nits severity. However, because ultrasound is more widely available, abdominal ultrasound \ncan also be considered a valid alternative.\nTreatment \nComplicated cases\nPatients with suspected or confirmed complicated acute diverticulitis or with recurrent \nattacks should be promptly referred for surgical consultation. \nUncomplicated cases \nIn immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis (i.e. localized diverticular \ninflammation) and no signs of systemic inflammation, antibiotic treatment is usually not \nneeded. In these patients, uncomplicated diverticulitis can be considered a self-limiting \ncondition where antibiotics do not offer a benefit in terms of clinical resolution and \nrecurrence (329,330) .\nAntibiotic treatment \nIn patients with complicated acute diverticulitis or in uncomplicated cases requiring antibiotic \ntreatment (e.g. cases that did not resolve spontaneously after 2\u20133 days without antibiotic \ntreatment) or in severely immunocompromised patients, empiric antibiotic treatment should \nbe chosen based on the severity of symptoms (mild or severe). It is important to take into \naccount local prevalence of resistance, particularly isolates of Enterobacterales producing \nESBLs, since the prevalence can vary greatly among settings (Table 32.4). Individual risk \nfactors for resistant pathogens (e.g. recent antibiotic treatment, colonization with resistant The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 461HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n32. Intra-abdominal infections \u2013 acute diverticulitis\npathogens) should also be considered. In settings where resistance to carbapenems is \nhighly prevalent, alternative antibiotic options including Reserve antibiotics \u2013 see chapter \non Reserve antibiotics \u2013 could be considered in severely ill patients who are deteriorating. \nIn complicated cases (i.e. presence of perforation or abscess), empiric antibiotic treatment \nshould be started as soon as the diagnosis is suspected and could be stopped 4 days after \ncontrol of the source of infection is achieved provided there is good clinical recovery. \nPatients with small abscesses (< 5 cm) or pericolic gas are usually treated with \nsystemic antibiotic treatment alone provided close clinical follow up is possible and there is \na good clinical response and symptoms have resolved (331) .\nIn patients with large abscesses (e.g. percutaneous drainage of abscesses > 5 cm) \nand patients with peritonitis, control of the source of infection (e.g. colonic resection), in \naddition to systemic antibiotic treatment, is needed. \nSimplify  empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called \nde-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or based on rapid clinical \nimprovement when no microbiology test results are available.\nStep-down  to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs \nof infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home \nwhen clinically appropriate.\nIf signs and symptoms persist, abdominal imaging is suggested, or an alternative \nextra-abdominal source of infection should be considered. 462 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n32.

Intra-abdominal infections \u2013 Clostridioides difficile  infection468 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\nPathogen\nClostridioides difficile  is a Gram-positive anaerobic spore-forming bacterium that is widely \npresent in the environment, especially in hospitals and long-term care facilities where \nspores can persist in the environment for months. Toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains exist \nbut Clostridioides difficile  infection is only associated with toxigenic strains. Of these strains, \nBI/NAP1/027 is particularly virulent and in recent years has caused outbreaks, especially in \nNorth America.\nPathophysiology\nClostridioides difficile  infection is acquired through the ingestion of toxigenic spores of the \nGram-positive bacterium Clostridioides difficile . Spores are present in stools of symptomatic \npatients and asymptomatic carriers. Once ingested, the spores can colonize the colonic \nmucosa, germinate into vegetative bacteria, multiply and produce toxins (toxin A and/\nor B, binary toxin). In most cases, patients remain asymptomatic. However, if disruption \nof the normal colonic mucosa and intestinal microbiota occurs (e.g. after exposure to \nantibiotics or cytotoxic chemotherapy) and if there is no adequate antibody response to \nClostridioides difficile  toxins, clinical disease can occur. This disease ranges in severity, from \nmild diarrhoea to life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon. Not all \nstrains of Clostridioides difficile  produce toxins. Recurrent infections are a frequent problem, \nespecially in elderly and immunocompromised patients, and the risk of relapse increases \nwith each episode.\nEpidemiology\nClostridioides difficile  infection is the most frequent cause of health care-associated infectious \ndiarrhoea and is associated with prolonged hospital stay and increased costs (333,334) .\nCommon risk factors for Clostridioides difficile  infection include age \u2265 65 years, \nrecent use of antibiotics and previous hospital admission (335) . Almost all antibiotics can \nincrease the risk of infection but clindamycin, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones have \nbeen most consistently associated with increased risk of Clostridioides difficile  infection \u2013 the \nrisk may vary across time and settings based on the resistance/susceptibility of Clostridioides \ndifficile  to certain antibiotics. Cytotoxic chemotherapy can also increase the risk of infection \nbecause inflammation of the intestinal mucosa (i.e. mucositis) is often present. Patients \nregularly exposed to health care settings (e.g. patients on dialysis) are also at increased risk.\nIn young children (especially younger than 2 years), clinical disease is rare, probably \nbecause cellular receptors to Clostridioides difficile  toxins develop later in life; therefore, \nyoung children are often asymptomatic carriers.33. Intra-abdominal infections \u2013 Clostridioides difficile  infectionThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 469HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\nClinical presentation\nThe most common symptom of Clostridioides difficile  infection is diarrhoea, usually defined \nas the presence of at least three unformed or liquid stools in 24 hours (with no other \nplausible cause), or more than what is normal for that individual. Abdominal pain, cramping \nand fever may also be present. Signs of severe disease include marked leukocytosis (e.g. \nwhite blood cell count > 15 \u00d7 109/L or 15 000/\u03bcL), severe abdominal pain, high fever and \norgan dysfunction, for example, elevated serum creatinine and decreased serum albumin.\nRarely, Clostridioides difficile  infection can present with signs and symptoms of toxic \nmegacolon. Patients with this presentation often do not have diarrhoea but have signs of \nacute surgical abdomen and/or sepsis and may need to be admitted to the intensive care \nunit. The absence of diarrhoea does therefore not exclude Clostridioides difficile  infection. \nSevere cases may require a colectomy for source control.\nLaboratory tests \nPatient microbiology tests\nWhere available, a stool test in a symptomatic patient to detect toxigenic Clostridioides difficile  \n(or toxin production) should be considered if the patient has no other reasons for diarrhoea, \nsuch as recent use of laxatives. The rationale is that, if infection is detected, an effective \ntreatment can be provided, other antibiotics can be stopped if possible and infection control \nmeasures can be put in place (or reinforced) to limit transmission. Testing is not usually \nrecommended in infants because of the high prevalence of colonization; colonization here \nrefers to the presence of Clostridioides difficile  in the stool of healthy children.\nEven though the current version of the WHO EDL (6) does not include specific tests \nfor Clostridioides difficile  detection, Table 33.1 suggests tests that could be considered based \non local availability. \nCurrently, no single test is completely reliable in diagnosing Clostridioides difficile  \ninfection and the best diagnostic approach to use is controversial (336) . The two following \napproaches are commonly used and could be considered based on local available tests and \nlaboratory protocols. For both approaches, it is important to limit testing to patients with \na sufficiently high pre-test probability of Clostridioides difficile  infection, for example, with \ndiarrhoea and risk factors such as current or recent antibiotic use.\n\u2022 Start with a highly sensitive test (nucleic acid amplification test or glutamate \ndehydrogenase test depending on local availability) that can detect the presence \nof Clostridioides difficile . Then, confirm positive results with a test that can detect \ntoxin production such as the toxin A/B enzyme immunoassay. It should be noted 33. Intra-abdominal infections \u2013 Clostridioides difficile  infection470 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\nthat if the toxin production test is negative, the patient could be colonized with \nClostridioides difficile  and therefore an alternative reason for diarrhoea should be \nsought.\n\u2022 Start with two tests at the same time \u2013 glutamate dehydrogenase test and toxin \nA/B enzyme immunoassay.

If the results conflict, then symptomatic patients should be treated \nif the pre-test probability of Clostridioides difficile  infection is sufficiently high, for \nexample, with recent antibiotic exposure and absence of alternative causes of \ndiarrhoea.\nIn patients diagnosed with Clostridioides difficile  infection, repeat testing during the \nsame episode and test of cure are not needed and should be avoided.\nTable 33.1 \u2013 Microbiology tests to consider if Clostridioides difficile  infection is \nsuspected (no test for Clostridioides difficile  is listed in the third version of the EDL, \n2021) (6)\nType of test Purpose of the test Comment\n\u2022 Culture \n\u2022 NAAT\n\u2022 GDH antigen testTo detect toxigenic \nClostridioides difficile  strainsUsually NAAT (culture \nwould be the reference \nstandard but it is complex \nto perform and has a \nlong turnaround time). \nWith NAATa, the main \ndisadvantage is the \nhigh sensitivity of the \ntest that could lead \nto over-diagnosis and \novertreatment.\n\u2022 GDH antigen test To detect Clostridioides difficile  \ntoxigenic and non-toxigenic \nstrainsThe main disadvantage \nis that this test cannot \npredict the ability of the \nstrain to produce toxins. \nHowever, a negative test \nwill generally exclude \nClostridioides difficile  \ninfection.33.

In these cases, a CT scan \nof the abdomen could be considered.\nNo antibiotic care\nRehydration (oral or intravenous) should always be recommended in patients with \ndiarrhoea. Anti-diarrhoea medicines are not routinely required because they do not prevent \ndehydration and do not improve nutritional status (145) .\nAntibiotic treatment \nNote\nIt is important to discontinue any other antibiotics except those treating the Clostridioides \ndifficile  infection as soon as possible.\nSymptomatic patients diagnosed with Clostridioides difficile  infection should promptly \nreceive adequate antibiotic treatment as indicated in Table 33.3. Whenever possible, it is \nalso important to stop any other antibiotic that could have favoured Clostridioides difficile  \ninfection by disrupting the microbiota in the colon. If it is necessary to continue the antibiotic \ntreatment (e.g. because of a clearly documented or high suspicion of a concomitant \ninfection), it is advisable to select antibiotics with lower risk of selecting Clostridioides difficile  \ninfection, thus avoid ceftriaxone, fluoroquinolones and clindamycin.\nOral treatment with metronidazole is appropriate for a first episode of mild \nto moderate severity. This antibiotic is also suggested because of concerns that oral \nvancomycin could favour selection of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in the intestinal \nmicrobiota and that the oral formulation may be unavailable or too expensive to consider \nin some low-resource settings (337,338) . However, in severe cases of infection, the current \nevidence supports the use of oral vancomycin rather than metronidazole, in part because \nof its benefit in reducing recurrent episodes (337\u2013339) . Treatment of recurrent episodes \n(usually defined as Clostridioides difficile  infection within 8 weeks of a previous episode) with \nantibiotics or faecal microbiota transplantation is beyond the scope of this chapter.33.

Upper urinary tract infection \nKey messages\n\u2022 Most cases of upper urinary tract infection are caused by Escherichia coli .\n\u2022 A urine culture should be obtained before starting antibiotic treatment.\n\u2022 Mild cases can be treated with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting.\n\u2022 Empiric treatment varies depending on the severity of clinical presentation and underlying \nrisk factors.\n\u2022 The local prevalence of resistance among Escherichia coli  urinary isolates needs to be \nconsidered if data are available.\nOther relevant WHO resources (please check regularly for updates)\n\u2022 Pocket book of hospital care for children: guidelines for the management of common \nchildhood illnesses, 2013 (31).\nDefinition\nUpper UTIs are acute infections in which pathogens (mostly bacteria from the intestinal \nmicrobiota colonizing the skin in the perineal area) reach the kidney/s by ascending \nthrough the urethra, bladder and the ureter/s. In addition, pathogens can gain access to the \nkidney/s through the bloodstream. An infection of the kidney/s is commonly referred to as \npyelonephritis. Infections can be community acquired or hospital acquired. The focus of this \nchapter is on community-acquired pyelonephritis in immunocompetent patients without \na urinary catheter. \nComplications can occur with upper UTIs because of patient-related risk factors \nthat make the infection more difficult to treat. While there is no universally accepted \ndefinition of what constitutes a complicated UTI, upper UTIs in individuals with pre-existing \nconditions of the urinary tract (e.g. anatomical anomalies and kidney stones) are generally \nconsidered complicated. Upper UTIs in pregnant women are also usually considered \ncomplicated. Examples of factors that may increase the risk of a complicated upper UTI are \nshown in Box 34.1.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 475HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n34.

Some experts argue that \nthe list above is too long and may result in diagnosing too many patients with a so-called \ncomplicated infection. The presence of one or more of these risk factors does not mean that the \ninfection is complicated and in need of a different treatment approach.\nSource: Guidelines on urological infections of the European Association of Urology (222) .476\nThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n34.

Upper urinary tract infection \nPathophysiology\nUpper UTIs occur when pathogens reach the upper urinary tract and overcome the host \ndefences, which leads to tissue damage and an inflammatory response. Pathogens in the \nurine do not inevitably lead to infection. Infection will depend on the interaction between \nthe pathogen (e.g. the presence of specific virulence factors in the pathogen), the host (who \nmay be more or less likely to have infections because of, for example, underlying diseases) \nand the local conditions within the urinary tract, for example, because of abnormalities of \nthe urinary tract or the presence of foreign material such as a urinary catheter. Furthermore, \nit is important to note that urine can also become contaminated during sampling so that \nthe presence of bacteria in a urine sample does not necessarily mean bacteria are present \nin the urinary tract. \nEpidemiology\nUTIs are very common worldwide and can affect people at any age. In 2017, there were an \nestimated 274 million new cases of UTIs globally (upper and lower), combining all ages and \nboth sexes (44).\nThe incidence of UTIs is highest in women and increases with age (e.g. UTIs increase \nafter menopause) and frequency of sexual activity. These infections are particularly common \nin women because of the anatomy of their lower urinary tract; women have a shorter urethra \nthan men and so microorganisms colonizing the skin of the perineal area can more easily \nreach the bladder. Risk factors for UTIs include anatomical and functional abnormalities of \nthe urinary tract, such as conditions that predispose to incomplete emptying of the bladder, \nrenal insufficiency and urinary incontinence. Defective host immune factors (e.g. poorly \ncontrolled diabetes or neutropenia) and instrumentation of the urinary tract (e.g. urinary \ncatheters and stents) are also predisposing factors. \nMost likely pathogens\nMost UTIs are caused by enteric Gram-negative bacteria, most frequently Escherichia \ncoli, which is responsible for about 80% of cases in children and adults. Other causative \npathogens are shown in Table 34.1. Data on causative pathogens from low- and middle-\nincome countries are limited.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 481HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n34.

Symptoms of cystitis \n(dysuria, suprapubic tenderness, increased urgency and frequency) may or may not be \npresent.\nSeverity of signs and symptoms may range from mild disease (e.g. no nausea or \nvomiting, low-grade fever) that can be safely managed in an outpatient setting with oral \nantibiotic treatment to severe cases that require hospitalization and intravenous treatment \nto septic shock requiring admission to intensive care.\nIn younger children, symptoms are often non-specific, including high fever, \nirritability, vomiting and diarrhoea. In children older than 2 years, abdominal pain, urgency, \nfrequency and dysuria are more common. 482 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n34. Upper urinary tract infection \nLaboratory tests\nPatient microbiology tests\nIf upper UTI is suspected clinically, a urine culture should be done whenever possible, ideally \nbefore starting antibiotic treatment. The rationale is to confirm the diagnosis and to adjust \nempiric treatment based on susceptibility results.\n\u2022 Urine culture is considered positive when bacteria concentration in the urine is \nhigher than a certain cut-off concentration in symptomatic patients (e.g. \u2265 105 \nmicroorganisms/mL of urine). \n\u2022 Minimum cut-offs to diagnose an infection can vary by laboratory. \n\u2022 Lower cut-offs are often used to diagnose infections in females compared with \nmales or in patients with urinary catheters.\nNote\n\u2022 The presence of bacteria in the urine alone is not a sign of infection or an indication for \nantibiotic treatment. This condition is referred to as asymptomatic bacteriuria when no \nsymptoms suggestive of UTI are present.\n\u2022 Cut-offs of concentration of bacteria in the urine alone cannot distinguish infection \nfrom colonization. The pre-test probability of UTI always needs to be considered when \ninterpreting urine culture results.\n\u2022 Patients with positive urine cultures without symptoms suggestive of a UTI usually do not \nrequire treatment. There may be some exception such as pregnant women or patients who \nhave an invasive urological procedure scheduled, for whom pre-emptive antibiotic therapy \nmay be indicated.\nFor patients requiring hospitalization, a blood culture should be done where \npossible before starting antibiotic treatment to guide treatment.\nTable 34.2 summarizes the microbiology tests that can be done to diagnose \nupper UTIs.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 483HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n34.

In a symptomatic patient, leukocyturia (> 10 leukocytes/\u03bcL; > 0.01 \u00d7 109/L), the \npresence of leukocyte esterase and/or positive nitrites are indirect signs of infection.\nIn patients with a severe clinical presentation and when sepsis of urinary origin \nis suspected, a white blood cell count may be done to support the diagnosis of bacterial \ninfection as well as testing for biomarkers of infection, such as C-reactive protein. Table 34.3 \nsummarizes the laboratory tests that can be done to assist with the diagnosis of upper UTIs.\nTable 34.3 \u2013 Laboratory tests (other than microbiology) to consider for the diagnosis \nof upper urinary tract infections as indicated in the WHO EDL (6)\nDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Settings where the test \nshould be available\nUrinalysis test strips To detect urinary tract \ninfectionsCommunity settings and \nhealth facilities without \nlaboratoriesa\nUrine microscopy Presence or absence of: white \nblood cells, red blood cells; \npresence of casts and crystals \nin urineHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\ncontinues484 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n34.

For example, clinically relevant \nisolates for this infection would be blood and urine culture data from patients being \ntreated in the hospital with community-acquired upper UTIs. Data on severity of clinical \npresentation, underlying patient risk factors, previous and current antibiotic treatment, \ncurrent microbiology and clinical outcome would help to inform the development of \nlocal guidance. \nImaging\nRoutine imaging of all cases of upper UTI is not necessary. Initial imaging (e.g. ultrasound) \nof the urinary tract could be done in severely ill patients or during follow-up if an outflow \nobstruction or a fluid collection (i.e. abscess) is suspected.\nSymptomatic care\nMedicines that could be considered to control pain in upper UTI are given in Table 34.4.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 485HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n34.

The choice of empiric treatment should be based on the severity of symptoms \n(mild/moderate or severe). Many upper UTIs can be managed with oral antibiotics in the \noutpatient setting (340) .486 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n34. Upper urinary tract infection \nMild/moderate cases (adults and children)\nMild/moderate cases of upper UTIs are defined as patients who are not critically ill and there \nare no clinical signs of sepsis or septic shock. In these cases, for adults, a 7-day treatment \ncourse with oral ciprofloxacin should be considered if there is no nausea and vomiting, \n(Table 34.5). For young children it is clinically more difficult to make a clear distinction \nbetween upper and lower UTIs, with fever and general systemic signs of infection seen in \nboth groups. If systemic intravenous treatment is required, a third-generation cephalosporin \n(ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) is an option. Clinical improvement should be evident within 48\u2013\n72 hours of starting treatment. If no improvement is seen in that time, a complication (such \nas an abscess) should be considered and investigated by imaging, and the susceptibility of \nbacteria isolated in the urine culture should be reviewed.\nStep-down  to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs \nof infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home \nwhen clinically appropriate.\nSevere cases (adults and children)\nSevere cases of upper UTIs are defined as patients who are critically ill, with sepsis and/or \nseptic shock. Please also refer to the chapter on sepsis if suspected. These cases should be \ntreated rapidly with systemic antibiotics. A third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or \ncefotaxime) or gentamicin or amikacin (Table 34.5) for 7 days, for both children and adults, \nis recommended (341,342) . Clinical improvement is usually evident within 48\u201372 hours of \nstarting treatment when a switch to oral antibiotics should be considered. \nSimplify  empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called \nde-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or based on rapid clinical \nimprovement when no microbiology test results are available.\nStep-down  to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs \nof infection and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing discharge of the patient home \nwhen clinically appropriate.\nSettings with high rates of resistant isolates\nEnterobacterales can develop resistance to antibiotics through different mechanisms, for \nexample, production of ESBL, ampicillinase C (AmpC) beta-lactamases and carbapenemases. \nResistance to beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g. in ESBL-producing strains) is often associated with \nresistance to other classes of antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones. Although resistance is \nhigher in hospital-acquired strains, it is also present in community-acquired infections. \nSpecific thresholds for when not to use particular antibiotics are given in some guidelines; \nhowever, these lack a strong evidence base with no clear rationale for the suggested cut-The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 487HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n34. Upper urinary tract infection \noffs. Therefore, local knowledge of the prevalence of resistance to antibiotic classes used to \ntreat UTIs should be considered, as well as individual risk factors (e.g. previous infection or \ncolonization with a resistant pathogen) and severity of clinical presentation. \nIn hospital settings where resistance to first-choice antibiotics (Table 34.5) is highly \nprevalent and in severely ill patients with acute clinical deterioration, piperacillin+tazobactam \nor a carbapenem could be considered, even though the EML and EMLc do not explicitly \nrecommend these options. Empiric use of a Reserve antibiotic could be considered \nexceptionally in very select cases of seriously ill patients failing to respond to carbapenems or \nwho have previously been treated for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant pathogens \nor who are known to be colonized with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria known \nto be susceptible to the selected Reserve antibiotic. Please refer to the chapter on Reserve \nantibiotic for the definition and list of Reserve antibiotics included in the EML and EMLc.\nTable 34.5 \u2013 Empiric antibiotic treatment for upper urinary tract infections\nImportant\nWhere more than one antibiotic is recommended for an infection, they are listed in alphabetical \norder and they should be considered equal treatment options, unless otherwise indicated.\nSeverity Adults Children Total treatment \nduration\nMild to \nmoderate \ncases Ciprofloxacin  a,b \n(oral): 500 mg given \nevery 12 hours \n(Ciprofloxacin \nhas excellent oral \nbioavailability \nand the IV route \nshould be reserved \nfor patients \nwith impaired \ngastrointestinal \nfunction.)

This combination \nstill has activity against some ESBL-producing isolates and it can be considered an acceptable option, particularly \nin young children.\na Resistance to fluoroquinolones is increasing including in low-and middle-income countries and in children (343\u2013\n345) .\nb The use of fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin) can be associated with important side-effects including: (i) \nmental health disturbances such as disorientation, agitation, nervousness, memory impairment and delirium; (ii) \nserious blood sugar disturbances such as hypoglycaemic coma; (iii) increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture; \n(iv) worsening symptoms in those with myasthenia gravis; and (v) potential irreversible neuropathy (serious nerve \ndamage).\nc In men with upper urinary tract infections, prostatitis can also be present and longer treatment may therefore be \nwarranted, but not universally as not each urinary tract infection episode in a male is associated with prostatitis.\nd Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is increasing including in low- and middle-income countries and \nin children (343\u2013345) . In very sick patients, gentamicin (or amikacin) can be given in combination with ceftriaxone \n(or cefotaxime). \ne Amikacin and gentamicin are still effective against isolates producing ESBL and are considered appropriate \ncarbapenem-sparing options in settings where ESBL-producing isolates are very prevalent. Use of aminoglycosides \ncan be associated with nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity, especially when used for more than 7 days.\nLegend: ACCESS antibiotics are indicated in green, WATCH antibiotics in orange and RESERVE antibiotics in red.

Acute bacterial osteomyelitis\nKey messages\n\u2022 Osteomyelitis can occur alone or in combination with septic arthritis.\n\u2022 In clinically stable adult patients, targeted treatment based on the results of microbiology \ntests is always preferable because of the large number of potential causes, risk of resistant \npathogens and long treatment.\n\u2022 In children there is less variability in causative pathogens (mostly Staphylococcus  spp. and \nStreptococcus  spp.) and empiric treatment is common practice.\n\u2022 In general, the intravenous route is preferred for initial treatment but rapid oral step down is \nincreasingly used.\n\u2022 Duration of treatment in children is usually shorter than in adults.\n\u2022 Dead bone, which is usually present in chronic infections, needs to be removed surgically \nfor antibiotic treatment to be successful.\nOther relevant WHO resources (please check regularly for updates)\n\u2022 Pocket book of hospital care for children: guidelines for the management of common \nchildhood illnesses, 2013 (31).\n\u2022 WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: module 3: diagnosis: rapid diagnostics for \ntuberculosis detection, 2021 update (346) .\n\u2022 WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: module 5: management of tuberculosis in \nchildren and adolescents (347) .\nDefinition\nOsteomyelitis is an infection of the bone characterized by inflammation and bone \ndestruction. Infection can be classified according to how the pathogen spreads in the body \n(via the bloodstream or by local spread from nearby tissue or through direct inoculation, \nfor example in cases of open fractures) or the duration of symptoms (acute or chronic). \nAcute infections develop and evolve over days or weeks, while chronic infections evolve \nover months or years. Chronic infections are also characterized by the presence of dead \nbone fragments (sequestrum).490 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n35. Acute bacterial osteomyelitis\nBoth classifications have implications for the management of osteomyelitis. For \nexample, the pathogens infecting bone by local spread are more variable than those \ninfecting bone via the bloodstream. In addition, dead bone, which is usually present in \nchronic infections, needs to be removed surgically for antibiotic treatment to be successful.

Acute bacterial osteomyelitis\nPathophysiology\nBacteria can reach the bone from a source of infection by spreading through the bloodstream \nor by local spread or by direct inoculation, for example, after trauma, bone surgery, prosthetic \njoint implantation, pressure or decubitus ulcers or diabetic foot infections. The infection can \naffect a single portion of the bone or can extend to the surrounding soft tissue. Infections \ncan rapidly lead to destruction of the affected bone.\nThe pathophysiology of osteomyelitis differs between children and adults; \nosteomyelitis caused by spread through the bloodstream is much more common in \nchildren (mostly < 5 years of age) where it usually affects long bones (mostly the tibia \nand femur) because the bones are more heavily vascularized in children. In adults, spread \nof the infection via the bloodstream is less common; nonetheless, it can occur (e.g. as a \nmetastatic infection of infective endocarditis) and in most cases if osteomyelitis is caused, \nit concerns the vertebra and intervertebral disc (vertebral osteomyelitis). However, in the \nadult population, dissemination by local spread (e.g. after trauma) is far more common.\nEpidemiology\nRisk factors for osteomyelitis are those associated with bacteraemia (e.g. presence of \nindwelling vascular catheters, injection drug use, haemodialysis) and those making the \nbone vulnerable to infection, such as bone surgery, open bone fracture, presence of foreign \nmaterial such as prosthetic joint implants, sickle-cell disease, diabetes and impaired bone \nvascularization. Acute suppurative and non-suppurative osteomyelitis of the jaw may also \nresult from oral and dental infections.\nAcute osteomyelitis in children is more frequent in low- and middle-income \ncountries and is more common in boys than in girls. If left untreated or managed late, acute \nosteomyelitis can leave children with long-term disability.\nThe global burden of osteomyelitis is still high, mostly in low- and middle-income \ncountries where the disease disproportionately affects the young and where delays in \ndiagnosis and adequate management can lead to acute forms that evolve into chronic \nosteomyelitis, which is very difficult to treat (348) .\nMost cases globally develop after a traumatic event, for example, infections in open \nfractures following road traffic incidents or combat. In addition, in high-income settings, diabetes \n(which can lead to foot osteomyelitis; not specifically addressed in this chapter) and spinal \ninterventions (which can lead to vertebral osteomyelitis) contribute to the burden of disease.\nMost likely pathogens\nThe most frequent pathogens associated with acute osteomyelitis in children and adults are \nshown in Table 35.1 and Table 35.2, respectively.496 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n35.

Acute bacterial osteomyelitis\nClinical presentation\nNote\nOsteomyelitis can occur alone or in combination with septic arthritis\nAcute osteomyelitis is characterized by gradual onset of localized pain and/or tenderness with \na combination of redness, swelling, pain and warmth of the affected area. Fever (\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C) \nand other signs of systemic infection (e.g. tachycardia, leukocytosis) may be present. In the \ncontext of osteomyelitis involving the vertebral spine, hip and pelvis, pain is usually the main \nsymptom.\nOsteomyelitis should also be suspected in case of defective healing of a fractured bone.\nIn children where acute osteomyelitis often involves the femur and tibia, difficulty \nand/or inability to walk or reluctance to move the limb may be a presenting symptom.\nNote\nOsteomyelitis can sometimes present as chronic illness; the patient appears less ill, with fewer \nmarked local signs, and perhaps without a fever. Consider tuberculous osteomyelitis (mostly \nvertebral also known as Pott disease) when the illness is chronic, discharging sinuses are \npresent (i.e. when a passage (sinus) forms from the infected bone to the surface of the skin and \npus drains through) or the patient has other signs of tuberculosis.\nLaboratory tests\nPatient microbiology tests\nDetermining the causative pathogen of osteomyelitis is important to target antibiotic \ntreatment because the number of potential causative pathogens is large and antibiotic \nresistant pathogens (e.g. MRSA) are not infrequent; this makes it difficult to define \nappropriate empiric treatment. Duration of treatment may be long, thus increasing the risk \nof side-effects of the antibiotic therapy. Whenever possible, a microbiology sample should \ntherefore be obtained to guide antibiotic treatment (Table 35.3).500 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n35.

These tests are also assumed to be available at health care facilities with \nlaboratories.\nAdditional tests that could be considered mostly to help exclude other bone \ndiseases in adults (e.g. metastatic or metabolic bone disease) include calcium, phosphate \nand alkaline phosphatase. The rationale is that these tests are usually normal in case of \nosteomyelitis but they are usually abnormal in other bone diseases.\nUsing microbiology surveillance data \nRoutine clinical microbiology surveillance is generally not helpful in informing empiric \nguidance.\nImaging\nInitial imaging with an X-ray is important when bone infections are suspected. However, \na normal X-ray on admission does not rule out acute osteomyelitis but it can help exclude \nalternative diagnoses, such as a fracture or a malignant condition. In an X-ray, changes \nsuch as soft tissue swelling, periosteal thickening and/or elevation and lytic lesions are \noften found later than clinical disease. An X-ray could also help identify a sequestrum \n(dead bone) that needs to be removed surgically. Where available, a CT scan or magnetic \nresonance imaging (MRI) could also be considered in certain patients, for example, in cases \nof diagnostic uncertainty with X-ray. MRI has a high degree of sensitivity and specificity to \ndetect bone changes, especially in the early phase. Nuclear imaging (e.g. bone scan or bone \nscintigraphy) could also be considered as an alternative where available.502 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n35. Acute bacterial osteomyelitis\nSurgical treatment\nIn adults, no surgical intervention is required in most cases of acute osteomyelitis that are \ndiagnosed and managed early in the course of illness. These cases can be treated with an \nantibiotic alone with good bone penetration. However, in certain cases of acute osteomyelitis \n(and always in case of chronic infections), surgical debridement of the bone may be required \nto reduce the risk of complications because of impaired local vascularization (e.g. avascular \nnecrosis of the bone, permanent bone damage) and to remove \u201cdead\u201d bone and clean the \nsurrounding soft tissue.\nIn children, acute osteomyelitis is usually treated with medical management alone \n(i.e. no surgery).\nNote\nFor prosthetic joint infections, treatment usually requires the surgical removal of the device. \nThis can be done in one stage (the new prosthesis is immediately inserted) or two stages (the \ninfected prosthesis is removed, the area is debrided, antibiotic treatment is given for several \nweeks and finally the new prosthesis is inserted). The choice of one stage or two stages \ndepends on the location of the prosthesis (e.g. hip, knee), characteristics of the patient (e.g. \nadvanced age, comorbidities) and local practices. \nA detailed discussion of prosthetic-joint infections is beyond the scope of the AWaRe book.\nAntibiotic treatment\nNote\nIn adults with osteomyelitis, targeted antibiotic treatment based on microbiology is always \npreferred. In children, it is unusual to identify the pathogen and empiric treatment is usually given.\nIn adults, empiric treatment is sometimes required, for example, in severely ill patients \nrequiring immediate treatment or when it is not possible to obtain a clinical sample for \nmicrobiological examination. In these cases, the choice of the antibiotic needs to be \nbased on the pathogens most commonly identified in this type of infections (Table 35.5). \nIn addition, empiric treatment against community-acquired MRSA could be considered \nin some cases based on individual risk factors (e.g. MRSA colonization) and on the local \nprevalence of community-acquired MRSA. \nDuration of treatment is usually long (weeks) but it differs in acute or chronic \ninfections. Duration is also influenced by the presence, absence or removal of foreign bodies The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 503HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n35. Acute bacterial osteomyelitis\n(including dead bone), the type of causative organism and its resistance profile, the use of \nantibiotics with an optimal antibiotic spectrum (i.e. based on microbiology results), and \ngood bone penetration. \nTotal treatment duration of about 3 weeks is usually adequate in patients with \nuncomplicated disease and good clinical recovery, while complicated disease may require \n6 weeks of treatment. \nUncomplicated infections are those with symptoms for < 14 days, no underlying \ndisease, no penetrating trauma and no need for extensive surgical intervention.\nImaging studies are usually not useful to determine the duration of treatment.\nSimplify  empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called \nde-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or rapid clinical improvement if \nculture results unavailable. Historically, the intravenous route has always been preferred, at \nleast in the initial phase of treatment. \nStep down  to oral antibiotics at home is increasingly being used early in the \ntreatment course (e.g. in the first week) when the disease is uncomplicated (349) . Step down \nto oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs of infection, improved \nclinical function and the ability to take oral antibiotics with good bone penetration, \nespecially in adults (e.g. clindamycin).504 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n35.

Acute bacterial osteomyelitis\nTable 35.5  continued\nIV: intravenous; MRSA: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus .\nNotes. All dosages are for normal renal and hepatic function.\nAs mentioned in the text, empiric treatment should be avoided whenever possible in adults because there \nare many potential causative pathogens and high levels of resistance (e.g. MRSA) making it difficult to specify \nappropriate empiric treatment. In children, there is usually less variability in the most likely causative pathogens \n(in children the disease is mostly caused by spread of Staphylococcus  spp. and Streptococcus  spp. through the \nbloodstream) and therefore empiric treatment is common practice.\nIn neonates, empirical antibiotic therapy should also cover Enterobacterales because infections caused by \nGram-negative bacteria can occur in neonates, but Staphylococcus aureus  remains the most common pathogen. \nTherefore, in neonates, empiric use of cefotaxime (or ceftriaxone) is appropriate; ceftriaxone should be avoided \nin infants with hyperbilirubinaemia. In older children, bone infections caused by Enterobacterales are very rare.\na If cloxacillin is unavailable, any other IV antistaphylococcal penicillin could be used. For oral administration, \ndicloxacillin and flucloxacillin are preferred options within the class as they have better oral bioavailability. In adults, \na higher dose (e.g. 12 g/day) could be considered given the concerns with bone penetration.\nb Three weeks of treatment (usually starting with 3\u20135 days IV treatment and then changing to oral treatment) are \nnow commonly used in children with acute bloodborne osteomyelitis based on response to fever, ability to move \nthe limb and reduction in levels of C-reactive protein (if available).\nc Longer treatments may be required if implants or foreign material are present or in case of inadequate control at \nthe source of infection; for example, where there is an abscess that has not been adequately drained. \nd Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime is preferred if invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella  or Enterobacterales infection are \nsuspected. In neonates, cefotaxime is recommended in these cases.\ne Clindamycin is still an acceptable option when community-acquired MRSA is suspected or detected if antimicrobial \nsusceptibility tests show that MRSA is sensitive to clindamycin or in settings where MRSA maintains high levels of \nsusceptibility to clindamycin. Clindamycin can also be used when changing from the IV to the oral route, and in \npatients allergic to penicillin. In case of MRSA isolates resistant to clindamycin and in settings where the prevalence \nof community-acquired MRSA is high, the use of vancomycin could be considered when Staphylococcus aureus  is \nsuspected. Oral options to consider to complete the course of treatment in case of MRSA or methicillin-susceptible \nStaphylococcus aureus  infections could be sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim and doxycycline. \nf Oral liquid formulations must be refrigerated after reconstitution as clavulanic acid is rapidly metabolized in high \nambient temperatures.\nLegend: ACCESS antibiotics are indicated in green, WATCH antibiotics in orange and RESERVE antibiotics in red.

Septic arthritis\nPathophysiology\nIn septic arthritis, bacteria can reach the joint through dissemination through the bloodstream, \nby local spread or by direct inoculation from a contiguous infected bone or soft tissue, for \nexample, local spread following trauma or bites, bone surgery, prosthetic joint implantation, \npressure and decubitus ulcers and diabetic foot infections (350) . Dissemination through the \nbloodstream is more common in both children and adults. Once bacteria gain access to the \njoint space, they can adhere to the articular cartilage, produce an inflammatory response \nand promote cartilage destruction within hours. If left untreated, septic arthritis can rapidly \nlead to destruction of the cartilage. It therefore needs to be rapidly diagnosed and treated.\nEpidemiology\nSeptic arthritis is associated with substantial morbidity (e.g. adverse joint outcomes) and \nlow mortality (350,351) . People at risk of septic arthritis are people with a higher risk of \nbacteraemia (e.g. those with indwelling vascular catheters, injection drug users, patients \non haemodialysis) and those with a higher likelihood of the joint becoming infected, for \nexample, patients with rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, sickle-cell disease and prosthetic \njoints and other foreign material. Post-surgical infections are common in adults. Community-\nacquired infections are quite rare in adults, while they are common in children.\nIn children, septic arthritis is more frequent in low- and middle-income countries \nand in boys more than girls. If left untreated or managed late, septic arthritis can leave \nchildren with long-term disability.\nGonococcal arthritis, characterized by dissemination of the infection through the \nbloodstream, is a rare complication of gonorrhoea that mostly affects women. \nMost likely pathogens\nA large variety of pathogens can cause septic arthritis with some differences between \nchildren and adults (Table 36.1 and Table 36.2).The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 513HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n36.

Septic arthritis\nClinical presentation\nNote\nSeptic arthritis can occur alone or in combination with osteomyelitis.\nSeptic arthritis is characterized by acute onset (usually a few days, but up to 2 weeks) of \njoint pain (moderate to severe) and reduced range of motion with redness, swelling and \nwarmth of the joint. The condition may be less evident when \u201cdeep\u201d joints such as the hip, \nshoulder or sacroiliac joint are affected. In most cases, one single joint is affected (often \nthe knee). Involvement of more than one joint (polyarticular infection) is more common \nwith underlying rheumatoid arthritis. Other signs of systemic infection (e.g. fever \u2265 38.0 \u00b0C, \ntachycardia, increased biomarkers of inflammation) are usually present.\nIn certain situations (e.g. septic arthritis of multiple joints), it is important to exclude \nan extra-articular source of infection such as endocarditis.\nIn young children permanent destruction of the joint cartilage and long-term \ndisability can occur rapidly, therefore rapid diagnosis and prompt empiric antibiotic \ntreatment are essential.\nIn case of gonococcal arthritis, typical signs and symptoms of septic arthritis (mostly \naffecting one or a few joints and usually the knees and ankles) are usually accompanied by \nskin manifestations such as rash or small papules on the trunk and distal extremities. Often \npatients with gonococcal arthritis have no signs or symptoms of cervicitis or urethritis.\nLaboratory tests\nPatient microbiology data\nDetermining the causative pathogen of septic arthritis is important for targeted antibiotic \ntreatment because the number of potential causative pathogens is large (making it difficult \nto select empiric treatment) and treatment duration may be long, increasing the risk of side-\neffects from the antibiotic therapy. \nWhenever possible, a microbiology sample should therefore be obtained to guide \nantibiotic treatment (Table 36.3). Ideally microbiology test results should be obtained before \nstarting antibiotic treatment. However, because cartilage destruction can occur within \nhours, tests should never delay the start of antibiotic treatment.516 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n36.

In cases of gonococcal arthritis, the culture of the synovial fluid is usually \nnegative.\nb This test is not validated on the synovial fluid but is used in some settings.\nOther tests\nLaboratory tests can be used to complement the clinical examination and history and may \nhelp decide between bacterial septic arthritis and a viral reactive arthritis. Table 36.4 and \nTable 36.5 list tests that could be considered in the initial assessment of the patient to help \nmake a diagnosis and guide the duration of antibiotic treatment.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 517HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n36.

These tests are also assumed to be available at health care facilities with \nlaboratories.\nTable 36.5 \u2013 Synovial fluid examination\nDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Settings where the test \nshould be available\nSynovial fluid: white cell count \nand crystalsaTo detect the presence or \nabsence of white blood cells \nand crystalsHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\na With septic arthritis, it is helpful to know the number of white blood cells in the synovial fluid and microscopy \nshould also be done to investigate alternative diagnoses such as gout or chondrocalcinosis. Compared to non-\ninfectious arthritis, acute bacterial infections are characterized by a much higher white cell count in the synovial \nfluid, usually > 20 000 cells/\u03bcL (20 \u00d7 109 cells/L) with > 90% being neutrophils.\nUsing microbiology surveillance data \nDue to the wide number of pathogens identified, there is no role for routine surveillance \ncultures to inform empiric guidance. 518 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n36. Septic arthritis\nImaging\nInitial imaging with an ultrasound is useful when joint infections are suspected to detect \njoint effusion and synovial swelling due to the presence of increased intra-articular fluid.\nMRI could also be considered, if available, in certain patients particularly when \nconcomitant osteomyelitis is suspected, because MRI is more sensitive and specific than \nultrasound in detecting bone changes.\nTreatment\nPrompt surgical drainage of any purulent material (aspiration) and washing of the joint \n(lavage) is a key part of the management of septic arthritis since antibiotics alone are \nusually not sufficient to control the source of the infection, at least in adults. Aspiration \nand lavage can reduce the risk of complications, such as permanent cartilage destruction, \njoint deformity and instability and degenerative arthritis. Immobilization of the joint is not \nnecessary except for pain control.\nNote\nFor prosthetic-joint infections, treatment can be in one or two stages depending on the \nlocation of the prosthesis (e.g. hip, knee), characteristics of the patient (e.g. older age, \ncomorbidities) and on local practices. In the one-stage procedure, the old device is surgically \nremoved and the new prosthesis is immediately inserted. In the two-stage procedure, the \ninfected prosthesis is removed, the area is debrided and antibiotic treatment is given for several \nweeks. Then, in the second stage, the new prosthesis is inserted. \nA detailed discussion of prosthetic-joint infections is beyond the scope of this chapter.\nAntibiotic treatment\nNote\nIn adults, targeted antibiotic treatment based on microbiology results is always preferred \n(unless the patient is severely ill or it is impossible to obtain a clinical sample for microbiological \nexamination) because there are many potential causative pathogens, which makes it difficult to \nselect an appropriate empiric treatment.\nIn young children, the treatment is often empiric.\nWhen patients require empiric treatment (mostly young children or severely ill patients \nor when it is impossible to obtain a clinical sample for microbiological examination), the  The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 519HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n36. Septic arthritis\nchoice should be based on the most probable pathogens in this type of infection, mostly \nStaphylococcus aureus  and Streptococcus  spp. (Table 36.6). In addition, empiric treatment \nagainst community-acquired MRSA or Neisseria gonorrhoeae  may be considered in certain \ncases based on individual risk factors (e.g. known MRSA colonization) and compatible \nclinical and epidemiological features.\nThe duration of treatment is long \u2013 several weeks, except for gonococcal arthritis \nwhich requires shorter treatment. Duration of treatment is influenced by: duration of \nsymptoms (acute or chronic); presence, absence or removal of foreign bodies (including \ndevitalized bone if concomitant osteomyelitis is present); type of causative pathogen and its \nresistance profile; and concomitant presence of osteomyelitis, and therefore the availability \nof antibiotics with good bone penetration.\nThe total treatment duration is generally 3 weeks in children and 4\u20136 weeks in \nadults. With gonococcal arthritis, a shorter treatment duration (10\u201314 days) is adequate.\nSimplify  empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also \ncalled de-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or rapid clinical \nimprovement if culture results unavailable. Historically, the intravenous route has always \nbeen preferred at least in the first week of treatment. However, recent evidence suggests \nthat a change to oral antibiotics in the first week of treatment can be used for patients with \nuncomplicated disease.\nStep down  to oral treatment is based on improvement of symptoms and signs \nof infection, improvement in joint function and the ability to take oral antibiotics allowing \ndischarge of the patient home when clinically appropriate.520 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n36.

Septic arthritis\nIV: intravenous; MRSA: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus .\nNotes. All dosages are for normal renal and hepatic function.\nAs mentioned in the text, targeted treatment is preferable whenever possible in adults because of the large \nnumber of potential causative pathogens, while in children empiric treatment is often given.\nIn neonates, empirical antibiotic therapy should also cover Enterobacterales because infections caused by Gram-\nnegative bacteria can occur, but Staphylococcus aureus  remains the most common pathogen. Therefore, in \nneonates, empiric use of cefotaxime (or ceftriaxone) is appropriate; ceftriaxone should be avoided in infants with \nhyperbilirubinaemia. In older children, joint infections caused by Enterobacterales are very rare.\na If cloxacillin is unavailable, any other IV antistaphylococcal penicillin could be used. For oral administration, \ndicloxacillin and flucloxacillin are preferred options within the class as they have better oral bioavailability. In adults, \na higher dose (e.g. 12 g/day) could be considered given the concerns with bone penetration.\nb Shorter duration (10\u201314 days) in cases of gonococcal arthritis.\nc Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime is preferred in cases of suspected invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella  infection or \nEnterobacterales infection or gonococcal arthritis. In neonates, cefotaxime is recommended in these cases.\nd Clindamycin is still an acceptable option when community-acquired MRSA is suspected if antimicrobial \nsusceptibility tests show that MRSA is sensitive to clindamycin or in settings where MRSA maintains high levels \nof susceptibility to clindamycin; suspicion should be based on local prevalence of community-acquired MRSA. \nClindamycin can also be used when changing from the IV to oral route, and in patients allergic to penicillin. For \nsevere disease potentially caused by MRSA, vancomycin can be considered in settings with local high prevalence \nof community-acquired MRSA, even though this is not a recommendation included in the current EML and EMLc \n(8,9) . In case of MRSA and based on susceptibility results, alternative oral options that could be considered to \ncomplete the course of treatment include sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim and doxycycline. \ne Oral liquid formulations must be refrigerated after reconstitution as clavulanic acid is rapidly metabolized in high \nambient temperatures.\nLegend: ACCESS antibiotics are indicated in green, WATCH antibiotics in orange and RESERVE antibiotics in red.Table 36.6  continuedThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 523HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n37. Skin and soft tissue infections \u2013 \nnecrotizing fasciitis\nKey messages\n\u2022 Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening rapidly progressing infection of the deep soft tissue \nwith pain out of proportion to skin findings.\n\u2022 Surgery is both diagnostic and therapeutic (surgical exploration and debridement of \nnecrotic tissue) and delays in surgery are associated with higher mortality.\n\u2022 Antibiotic treatment is important but needs to be accompanied by source control (surgery).\n\u2022 Children are rarely affected. Cases occur mostly in immunocompromised children or as a \ncomplication of chickenpox.\nDefinition\nNecrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening necrotizing infection of the deep soft tissues that \nspecifically affects the muscular fascia \u2013 the fascia is the connective tissue surrounding \nthe muscle. The disease is caused mostly by bacteria and is characterized by acute \nand fulminant (severe and sudden onset) necrosis with tissue destruction and signs of \nsystemic toxicity. Necrotizing fasciitis can be classified based on: the causative pathogen \n(type 1 or polymicrobial necrotizing fasciitis (caused by multiple pathogens); or type 2 or \nmonomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis (caused by a single pathogen)); the presence or absence \nof gas in tissues (polymicrobial infections are more often associated with the presence \nof gas); the site of the infection (e.g. leg, head and neck, perineum); or the risk of a poor \noutcome (high versus low or moderate risk). Necrotizing fasciitis affecting the perineum is \nalso called Fournier gangrene.524\nThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n37.

Skin and soft tissue infections \u2013 necrotizing fasciitis\nPathophysiology\nIn necrotizing fasciitis, bacteria can reach the muscular fascia by local spread through a skin \nlesion or a break in the skin barrier (e.g. wounds, bites, injection of drugs, surgery) or through \na breach in the mucosal barrier \u2013 usually in the intestine where the source could be a \ndiverticulum or a malignancy, or in the oropharynx. Infections can thus be both exogenous \n(i.e. pathogens that enter the body from the environment) and endogenous (i.e. pathogens \nthat naturally reside in the body). Often a clear place of entry is not identified. Bacteria can \nalso reach the muscular fascia via the bloodstream, although this is less common.\nNecrotizing fasciitis is characterized by tissue damage with necrosis and \ninflammatory fluid accumulation along the fascia and between muscle groups. The muscle \nis usually not affected; however, sometimes muscular abscesses can form. Legs and arms are \nthe most commonly affected sites.\nEpidemiology\nNecrotizing fasciitis is a rare but life-threatening disease. Polymicrobial (type 1) forms occur \nmost frequently in older adults and/or individuals with underlying comorbidities (mostly \ndiabetes (352) , peripheral vascular disease, immunosuppression) or traumatic or surgical \nwounds. Intravenous drug injection is also a risk factor. Monomicrobial (type 2) forms \ncan occur at any age, including in otherwise healthy individuals, and they are the most \ncommon form in children (353) . Toxic shock syndrome is a rare life-threatening complication \nof necrotizing fasciitis due to toxin production by Streptococcus pyogenes  (often referred to \nas group A Streptococcus ) or Staphylococcus aureus  and can also be the cause of septic shock \nwhen these pathogens are involved.\nMost likely pathogens\nThe most common pathogens causing mono- and polymicrobial necrotizing fasciitis are \nlisted in Table 37.1.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 529HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n37.

Therefore, the patient should always be \ncarefully monitored for signs of sepsis or septic shock. Please also refer to the chapter on \nsepsis if suspected.\nAdults\nNecrotizing fasciitis is usually characterized by acute onset of pain out of proportion to \nphysical findings in the affected area and rapid onset of systemic signs \u2013 for example, fever \n\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C, tachycardia and increased biomarker levels \u2013 leukocytosis, C-reactive protein and \nprocalcitonin (354) . \nSigns and symptoms of skin and soft tissue infections (i.e. redness, skin \ndiscolouration, swelling, induration (hardening of soft tissue) and warmth of the affected \narea) are usually present when pathogen entry is through the skin. However, at least initially, \nthe overlying skin often appears only minimally affected and skin changes \u2013 typically bullae \nand necrosis \u2013 only become apparent as the infection progresses. Rapid progression of \nredness, ecchymosis and bullae is also suggestive of this infection.\nIn cases of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier gangrene), severe pain \nis accompanied by signs of necrosis in the perineal area, often the scrotum in men. Rapid \nprogression of the infection to the abdominal wall and gluteal muscles is possible.530 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n37. Skin and soft tissue infections \u2013 necrotizing fasciitis\nWhile in patients with cellulitis, skin abnormalities are the usual symptoms, in \npatients with necrotizing fasciitis, severe pain (often disproportionate to skin changes) is \nthe characteristic symptom, at least in the initial phase. A definitive diagnosis requires the \ndirect visualization of necrotic tissue in the muscular fascia through surgical exploration.\nChildren\nNecrotizing fasciitis is very rare in children but may occur as a complication of varicella \n(chickenpox) or can be associated with a compromised immune system. Most characteristics \ndescribed for adults also apply to children, but certain specific features exist (355) . For \nexample, in neonates and infants, the torso is often affected, while in older children the \narms and legs and the face are affected. \nLaboratory tests\nPatient microbiology tests\nWhenever possible, a microbiology sample of the affected tissue should be obtained to \nguide antibiotic treatment; samples can be collected at the time of surgical exploration. This \nwill allow the causative pathogen(s) to be determined so that adequate antibiotic treatment \ncan be given, for example, single versus multiple causative pathogens. Blood cultures should \nalso be obtained, ideally before antibiotic treatment is started (Table 37.2).\nTable 37.2 \u2013 Microbiology tests to consider in a patient with suspected necrotizing \nfasciitis as indicated in the WHO EDL (6)\nDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Settings where the test \nshould be available\nBlood cultures and antimicrobial \nsusceptibility testingTo detect bacterial and fungal \nbloodstream infectionsHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\nMicroscopy, culture and \nantimicrobial susceptibility \ntesting of deep samples of tissue \ncollected at debridementaInitial step in detection and \nidentification of bacterial and \nfungal species for selection \nof appropriate antimicrobial \nregimensHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\nEDL: Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics.\na Intraoperative tissue samples should also be sent for histopathology examination.

If sepsis is suspected, additional tests may be needed; please refer to the chapter on sepsis.\nUsing microbiology surveillance data\nThere is no role for routine surveillance to inform empiric guidance. \nImaging\nImaging should not delay surgical exploration (or surgical inspection) since surgery is still \nthe most reliable tool to diagnose and treat necrotizing fasciitis.\nIf available, ultrasound imaging may help in the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis and \nto evaluate the extent to which the tissue is affected and the presence or absence of gas \nand fluid along the muscular fascia. A CT scan of the affected area could also be considered.\nManagement\nPrompt surgical removal of the necrotic tissue through drainage and debridement is the \ncornerstone of treatment of necrotizing fasciitis. Delays in this step are usually associated \nwith higher mortality (356) . Antibiotic treatment is a complementary measure to adequate \nsurgical source control of the infection.\nIntravenous immunoglobulin is occasionally used when shock is a complication \nin necrotizing fasciitis and therefore toxic shock syndrome (mostly due to Streptococcus \npyogenes  or Staphylococcus aureus ) is suspected; however, the effect of the use of high-cost \nintravenous immunoglobulin on mortality is unclear (357) .\nAntibiotic treatment\nBecause of the seriousness of necrotizing fasciitis and the speed at which it can progress, \nempiric antibiotic treatment should be given immediately when necrotizing fasciitis is \nsuspected. The antibiotics should cover both Gram-positive bacteria (including methicillin-\nresistant Staphylococcus aureus ) and anaerobic pathogens (Table 37.5).Table 37.4  continuedThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 533HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n37.

Skin and soft tissue infections \u2013 pyomyositis\nPathophysiology\nIn pyomyositis, bacteria reach the muscle from another source of infection spread through \nthe bloodstream. Once bacteria reach the muscle, an inflammatory reaction develops with \ninitial swelling of the muscle and progressive abscess formation and increasing oedema. \nThe process may take days to a few weeks for the signs of systemic infection to appear and \nthe presence of a pus collection large enough to be drained to become clinically evident.\nEpidemiology\nMost cases of pyomyositis occur in tropical countries often in young children (< 5 years) or \nin adults (aged 20\u201345 years), and males are more affected than females. History of trauma \nor muscle strain are usually present. HIV infection, malnutrition and malignancies may be \nrisk factors in the tropics, even though most patients are otherwise healthy. In non-tropical \ncountries, the disease is more common in adults with underlying severe medical conditions, \nsuch as immunocompromised patients (358) . \nClinical presentation\nPyomyositis is characterized by acute onset (usually days to a few weeks) of localized \nmuscle pain with cramping usually in the lower limbs or in the gluteal muscles (although \nany muscle can be affected) with a fever \u2265 38.0 \u00b0C. Swelling and induration (hardening of \nsoft tissue) of the affected area are also usually present when the disease becomes clinically \nevident. Other signs of systemic infection (e.g. tachycardia, increased biomarker levels such \nas leukocytosis, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin) are usually present. Abscess can form \nwithin days to weeks. Complications of bacteraemia (e.g. septic emboli, septic arthritis and \nendocarditis) can occur. The patient should always be monitored for signs of severe clinical \nprogression, such as signs of sepsis or septic shock. \nPlease also refer to the chapter on sepsis if suspected.\nMost likely pathogens\nMost cases (> 90%) of pyomyositis are caused by Staphylococcus aureus  including MRSA or by \nStreptococcus  spp. (mostly Streptococcus pyogenes  often referred to as group A Streptococcus ) \n(Table 38.1). Escherichia coli  can sometimes be implicated, especially in patients with cancer. \nMycobacteria ( Mycobacterium tuberculosis  and certain non-tuberculous mycobacteria) can \nalso be responsible for this infection.540 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n38. Skin and soft tissue infections \u2013 pyomyositis\nTable 38.1 \u2013 Pathogens most frequently associated with pyomyositis (in \ndescending order of frequency)\nMost cases More rarely \nStaphylococcus aureus  (including MRSA)a\nStreptococcus pyogenes  (group A Streptococcus )Escherichia coli  (mostly in patients with \ncancer)\nMycobacterium tuberculosis  and certain non-\ntuberculous mycobacteria\nMRSA: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus .\na Some strains can produce the Panton\u2013Valentine leukocidin, a toxin associated with a higher pathogenic potential \n(i.e. the risk of causing a more severe disease). The possibility of Staphylococcus aureus  positive for Panton\u2013\nValentine leucocidin should be considered especially in case of recurrent skin infections. In these cases, topical \ndecolonization measures might be considered to prevent recurrence and transmission to others.\nLaboratory tests\nPatient microbiology tests\nMicrobiology tests (cultures of blood and abscess material) can be done to determine the \ncausative pathogen and its resistance profile, ideally before starting antibiotic treatment \n(Table 38.2). In patients with severe disease, microbiology tests should however not delay \nantibiotic treatment.\nTable 38.2 \u2013 Microbiology tests to consider in a patient with suspected \npyomyositis as indicated in the WHO EDL (6)\nDiagnostic test Purpose of the test Settings where the test \nshould be available\nBlood cultures and antimicrobial \nsusceptibility testingTo detect bacterial and fungal \nbloodstream infectionsHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\nMicroscopy, culture and \nantimicrobial susceptibility \ntesting of deep samples \ncollected at aspiration/drainage \nof abscessInitial step to detect and \nidentify bacterial and fungal \nspecies for selection of \nappropriate antimicrobial \nregimensHealth care facilities with \nclinical laboratories\nEDL: Model List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 541HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n38.

If extensive muscle necrosis is present \nor if it is not possible to drain the collection of pus percutaneously, surgery may be necessary.542 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n38. Skin and soft tissue infections \u2013 pyomyositis\nAntibiotic treatment\nTargeted antibiotics based on microbiology tests are preferred in the treatment of \npyomyositis. However, when patients require immediate treatment (e.g. are severely ill) \nor when it is impossible to obtain a clinical sample for microbiological examination, the \nchoice of antibiotic should be based on the pathogens most commonly seen in this type \nof infection \u2013 Staphylococcus aureus  and Streptococcus  spp. (Table 38.4). In addition, empiric \ntreatment against community-acquired MRSA may be considered in some cases based \non individual risk factors (e.g. known MRSA colonization) and on the local prevalence of \ncommunity-acquired MRSA. In these cases, some international guidance documents \nsuggest using vancomycin (359) .\nIntravenous antibiotics may be needed, at least in the first phase of treatment.\nTreatment duration is long (usually 2\u20133 weeks) and is influenced by the clinical \nand radiological response and by the adequacy of drainage of the abscess, if present. \nShorter duration of treatment (2 weeks) could be considered in otherwise healthy patients \nand when adequate source control is achieved, that is the abscess is well drained.

Febrile neutropenia\nThis chapter focuses on empiric treatment of suspected or confirmed bacterial infections in \npatients with neutropenia (including neutropenic sepsis) but it does not cover antiviral or \nantifungal treatment or antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with afebrile neutropenia, which \nare beyond the scope of this chapter. \nKey messages\n\u2022 Neutropenia is the most common complication of cancer treatment with cytotoxic \nchemotherapy.\n\u2022 Patients can be at low or high risk of serious infections based on the duration of \nneutropenia.\n\u2022 Febrile neutropenia often presents as unexplained fever with no site of infection or \npathogen identified.\n\u2022 Diagnostic tests depend on the most likely site of primary infection.\n\u2022 Empiric antibiotic treatment should be started in febrile patients with a neutrophil count of \n< 500 cells/\u03bcL (< 0.5 \u00d7 109 cells/L) with treatment duration based on the clinical response \nirrespective of the neutrophil count.\nDefinition\nFebrile neutropenia is a severe condition that can be caused by common Gram-\npositive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi and other opportunistic pathogens. Febrile \nneutropenia occurs mostly in patients with neoplastic diseases who are receiving cytotoxic \nmyelosuppressive chemotherapy. \nTwo elements need to be considered in defining febrile neutropenia: fever and \nneutropenia.\nFor fever, there are no universally accepted temperature cut-offs and slightly \ndifferent cut-offs are used in different centres. Generally, a pragmatic definition of fever is \n\u2265 38.0 \u00b0C. A more precise definition is used by the Infectious Diseases Society of America in \ntheir 2010 Clinical practice guideline for the use of antimicrobial agents in neutropenic patients \nwith cancer (360)  which is:\n\u2022 a single oral temperature measurement of \u2265 38.3 \u00b0C or\n\u2022 a temperature of \u2265 38.0 \u00b0C sustained over 1 hour.546 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n39. Febrile neutropenia\nThere is less variation in definition of neutropenia, which is defined as a temporary \nreduction in the absolute neutrophil count; an absolute neutrophil count of < 1000 \n(sometimes < 1500) cells/\u03bcL (< 1.0 \u00d7 109 cells/L) is considered indicative of neutropenia. \nNeutropenia can be classified as severe when the absolute neutrophil count is < 500 cells/\u03bcL \n(< 0.5 \u00d7 109 cells/L) \u2013 also called agranulocytosis \u2013 and profound when absolute neutrophil \ncount is < 100 cells/\u03bcL (< 0.1 x 109 cells/L).\nFebrile neutropenia can be characterized according to identification of the causative \npathogen and source of infection as: \n\u2022 microbiologically proven infection (i.e. the causative pathogen is identified) \n\u2022 clinical source of infection diagnosed but no pathogen identified (e.g. pharyngitis)\n\u2022 unexplained fever (no pathogen identified and no clear source of infection) \n\u2022 non-infectious fever (e.g. medicine-induced).\nUnexplained fever with no focus or positive culture is the most common situation \nobserved in clinical practice.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book547\nHOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n39.

Febrile neutropenia\nPathophysiology\nNeutropenia (i.e. decreased number of circulating neutrophils) can develop as the result of a \nreduced production of neutrophils by the bone marrow, or increased peripheral destruction \nor sequestration at localized inflammatory sites. Once neutrophils fall below a certain \nthreshold, the risk of developing infections increases. Severity and duration of neutropenia \nare independent risk factors for serious infection, that is, the risk is higher with longer and \nmore severe neutropenia.\nIt is beyond the scope of this chapter to describe how cytotoxic chemotherapies and \ncancer affect the immune system and predispose to infection. As well as a reduced absolute \nneutrophil count, patients with cancer and on cytotoxic chemotherapy often also have \ndysfunctional lymphocytes or immunoglobulin deficiencies, impaired natural barriers to \ninfection (e.g. mucositis) and malnutrition, which additionally weaken their ability to control \ninfections. Furthermore, the presence of invasive devices (e.g. intravascular catheters) is an \nadditional risk factor for infection to consider.\nEpidemiology\nNeutropenia is the most common complication of cytotoxic cancer treatment that can lead \nto treatment delays and reductions in the chemotherapy dose (361) . The risk of developing \nfebrile neutropenia depends on: the type of underlying tumour (e.g. very high in patients \nwith acute leukaemia and lower in patients with solid tumours); the type and dose of \nchemotherapy used; and individual risk factors, such as older age, advanced stage of disease, \ncomorbidities, other concomitant myelotoxic medications (362) . The risk of developing \nsevere infection depends on the duration and severity of neutropenia; therefore, initial \nrisk assessment is an important step to identify patients at low or high risk of developing \nserious complications, such as complications requiring hospitalization or prolonging \nhospitalization. As well as the physician\u2019s assessment, several scoring systems exist (e.g. \nMultinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) score) to help predict this \nrisk (363) . These systems usually include a combination of factors, such as general clinical \nstatus of the patient, presence of comorbidities, age and whether the patient is hospitalized \nor not. However, no system can distinguish patients at low or high risk of infection with \ncomplete accuracy (364) .\nLow-risk patients are those expected to have a shorter duration of severe neutropenia \n(\u2264 7 days) and have no comorbidities (other than cancer) or renal or hepatic dysfunction. \nHigh-risk patients are expected to remain neutropenic for longer periods (> 7 days) or are \nthose with ongoing comorbidities (other than cancer) and renal or hepatic dysfunction. \nNeutropenia is also common in children receiving myelosuppressive treatment \u2013 \nespecially for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoma (the most common forms of 552 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n39. Febrile neutropenia\ncancer in childhood (365) ) and for acute myeloid leukaemia \u2013 or after haemopoietic stem \ncell transplantation or treatment for certain aggressive solid tumours, such as neuroblastoma \n(366,367) .\nMost likely pathogens\nA fever of infectious origin in a patient with neutropenia is most likely caused by bacteria \nthat colonize the patient\u2019s own skin and bowel, including multidrug-resistant organisms \nsuch as ESBL-producing or carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria (Table 39.1). \nThese patients often receive broad-spectrum antibiotics while in hospital and are therefore \nat increased risk of antibiotic-resistant infections. Furthermore, certain pathogens (e.g. \nfungi) become more frequent with longer duration of neutropenia.\nTable 39.1 \u2013 Pathogens most frequently associated with febrile neutropenia (in \ndescending order of frequency)\nBacteria Viruses Parasites\nStaphylococcus epidermidis\nStaphylococcus aureus  (including MRSA)\nStreptococcus  spp. \nOther Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. \nEnterococcus  spp. including VRE)\nEnterobacterales (including multidrug-\nresistant strains such as those producing \nESBL and carbapenemases)\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\nAnaerobesCytomegalovirus\nHuman herpesvirus 6\n(Consider viruses in \nhigh-risk patients \nmostly because of \nreactivation of latent \ninfections)Candida  spp.\nAspergillus  spp. (in \ncase of prolonged \nneutropenia)\nESBL: extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; MRSA: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ; VRE: vancomycin-\nresistant Enterococci.\nNotes. The risk of multidrug-resistant pathogens should always be carefully considered in patients with neutropenia \nbecause often infections in these patients are health care-associated.\nMost data come from tertiary care centres in high-income settings.\nClinical presentation\nApart from fever, other accompanying signs and symptoms of febrile neutropenia vary \ngreatly depending on the underlying infection, for example, pneumonia, UTI, skin infection, \nmeningitis, colitis. Bacteraemia (i.e. the detection of bacteria in blood cultures) may be \npresent. Because patients with neutropenia fail to produce effective inflammatory responses, \nthey can sometimes present with few clinical findings and no fever despite infection.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 553HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n39. Febrile neutropenia\nA detailed clinical examination should always be done to help identify the site of \ninfection. Skin changes (e.g. rash, ulcers, signs of vascular infection), changes in the oral \nmucosa and pharynx (e.g. ulcers inside the mouth, dental disease, thrush), abnormalities \nin the perineal and perirectal area, symptoms and signs of typhlitis (inflammation of the \ncecum) and colitis with abdominal pain, diarrhoea and sometimes rectal bleeding often \ndue to mucositis should therefore always be carefully investigated.\nClinical progression to severe disease or death can be very rapid (over a few hours); \ntherefore, the presence of any signs of sepsis or septic shock should always be carefully \nmonitored. Please also refer to the chapter on sepsis if suspected.\nLaboratory tests\nPatient microbiology tests\nWhenever possible a microbiology sample (e.g. blood cultures) should be obtained \u2013 ideally \nbefore antibiotic treatment is started \u2013 because results of the test can help establish the \ndiagnosis and treatment can be adapted accordingly.\nTests to consider depend on the most likely primary site of infection and should \ntherefore be adapted based on the clinical presentation (Table 39.2). Some tests should always \nbe performed (indicated as routine tests in Table 39.2), while others could be considered in \ncertain cases, including for surveillance purposes and based on local availability. Additional tests \nnot presented in the table but that could be considered, especially in high-risk patients, include \ntests to diagnose invasive fungal infections (e.g. Aspergillus  galactomannan antigen screening) \nand those for other viral infections, such as nucleic acid amplification test for cytomegalovirus.\nOther tests\nLaboratory tests to consider if febrile neutropenia is suspected depend on the most likely \nsource of infection and are shown in Table 39.3.554 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n39.

The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 557HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n39. Febrile neutropenia\nImaging\nImaging based on clinical presentation should be considered in the patient\u2019s initial \nassessment to identify the source of infection. If there is no clinical improvement and the \nfever does not resolve with treatment in a few days, additional imaging could be considered \n(e.g. CT scan of the lungs and sinuses, and other tests based on clinical suspicion) to expand \ndiagnostic work-up or to exclude a complicated infection such as invasive fungal disease.\nTreatment\nThis chapter focuses on antibiotic treatment of suspected or confirmed bacterial infections \nbut it does not cover antiviral or antifungal treatment. It also does not cover prophylaxis \nwith granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (i.e. growth factors that stimulate the bone \nmarrow to produce more neutrophils) such as filgrastim listed on the EML since 2015 for the \ntreatment of acquired neutropenia.\nThe use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors for therapeutic purposes \n(i.e. in febrile patients) is controversial and guidelines vary in their recommendations. \nEvidence shows that their use in combination with antibiotics does not reduce mortality \ncompared with antibiotics alone; however, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors could \nbe considered in certain patients because their use is associated with shorter hospital \nstay and duration of antibiotic use (reduced by 1\u20132 days) most likely due to the faster \nneutrophil recovery (371) .\nIt is important that source control is achieved as early as possible, this includes \ndrainage of any abscesses and removal or change of invasive devices such as central venous \ncatheters, where appropriate.\nAntibiotic treatment \nPatients with neutropenia who develop fever should promptly receive antibiotic treatment \neven when a clear site of infection is not identified (372) . \nLow-risk patients can be managed in an outpatient setting if adequate monitoring \nand follow-up are available and if they are able to tolerate oral treatment (373) . High-risk \npatients, or patients where close follow-up is not feasible, require hospitalization and initial \nintravenous treatment to start with. \nThe choice of empiric treatment should always consider a combination of factors, \nincluding the most likely site of primary infection and the infecting pathogens (including \nrisk of viral and invasive fungal infections) and the local pattern of AMR. Other factors, such \nas known colonization or previous infection with multidrug-resistant organisms and recent 558 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n39. Febrile neutropenia\nantibiotic exposure (including antibiotic prophylaxis) are also important factors to consider. \nRecommended empiric antibiotic options are given in Table 39.4.\nNote\nTable 39.4 refers to empiric treatment not to treatment escalation in case of persistent fever \nwhich is beyond the scope of the chapter.\nSimplify  empiric treatment to a more narrow-spectrum antibiotic (often also called \nde-escalation) based on culture results (targeted treatment) or rapid clinical improvement \nif culture results unavailable.\nStep down  to oral antibiotics is suggested when the patient has made a good \nclinical response, the fever has settled and the patient can tolerate oral antibiotics.\nAntibiotic treatment for patients with febrile neutropenia may require adjustments \nin dose and frequency of administration because pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic \nparameters could be altered in these patients and renal and hepatic toxicity related to \nchemotherapy is common (374) . \nIf the causative pathogen is identified, once susceptibilities are known, antibiotics \nshould be reviewed and modified accordingly. However, even if adequate microbiological \nsampling is performed, a pathogen is often not identified. \nIf fever persists (e.g. patient still has a temperature 48\u201372 hours after the start of \nantibiotic treatment) and there is no clinical improvement, further diagnostic tests (e.g. \nimaging) could be performed to identify the source of infection (if this is still unclear) or to \nassess whether a local complication has developed such as a fluid collection. In addition, \na resistant pathogen or an invasive fungal disease should be considered as they could be \nresponsible for the prolonged fever. \nDuration of treatment will mostly depend on the clinical response (e.g. resolution \nof fever and clinical recovery) and, if identified, on the infectious site and the causative \npathogen. \nContinuation of antibiotic treatment until neutrophil recovery (absolute neutrophil \ncount > 500 cells/\u03bcL; > 0.5 \u00d7 109 cells/L) is controversial with guidelines varying in their \nrecommendations. Evidence suggests that discontinuation of antibiotics based on a positive \nclinical assessment \u2013 for example, if the clinical recovery is good and no source is identified \nor if an infection has been adequately treated and irrespective of the neutrophil count \u2013 can \nsafely reduce exposure to antibiotics (375,376) .The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 559HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n39.

Not all surgical procedures require prophylaxis.\n\u2022 Prophylaxis should not be continued after surgery to prevent infection. One antibiotic dose \ncovers the entire duration of potential contamination during surgery in most cases.\nOther relevant WHO resources (please check regularly for updates)\n\u2022 Global guidelines for the prevention of surgical site infection, second edition (280) .\nDefinition of terms used in this chapter\nDefinitions are taken from the 2018 WHO publication: Global guidelines for the prevention of \nsurgical site infections (280) .\nAntibiotic prophylaxis : prevention of infectious complications by administering \nan effective antimicrobial agent before exposure to contamination during surgery.\nSurgical procedure : an operation where at least one incision (including \nlaparoscopic incisions) is made through the skin or mucous membrane, or a reoperation \nthrough an incision that was left open after a previous operative procedure, and takes place \nin the operating room.\nSurgical site infection : an infection that occurs after surgery in the part of the \nbody where the surgery took place. Surgical site infections can sometimes be superficial \ninfections involving the skin only. Other surgical site infections are more serious and can \ninvolve tissues under the skin, organs or implanted material.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 563HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n40. Surgical prophylaxis\nSurgical site infection is also defined as an infection that occurs up to 30 days after \nan operation and affects: \n\u2022 the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the surgical incision (superficial incisional); \nand/or \n\u2022 the deep soft tissue (for example, fascia or muscle) of the incision (deep incisional) \nand/or \n\u2022 any part of the anatomy (e.g. organs and spaces) other than the incision that was \nopened or manipulated during an operation (organ or space).\nSurgical wound : a wound created when an incision is made with a scalpel or other \nsharp cutting device and then closed in the operating room by suture, staple, adhesive tape, \nor glue and bringing the skin edges together.\nCategories of surgical wound\n\u2022 Clean : an uninfected surgical wound in which no inflammation is found, and \nwhich is not in the respiratory, alimentary, genital or urinary tracts. In addition, \nclean wounds are usually closed and, if necessary, drained with closed drainage. \nSurgical incisional wounds that are done after non-penetrating (blunt) trauma \nshould be included in this category if they meet the criteria.\n\u2022 Clean-contaminated : a surgical wound in the respiratory, alimentary, genital or \nurinary tracts which was made under controlled conditions and without unusual \ncontamination. Operations involving the biliary tract, appendix, vagina and \noropharynx are included in this category, provided no evidence of infection or \nmajor (i.e. significant) break in sterile technique is found.\n\u2022 Contaminated : open, fresh, accidental wounds. Also included in this category are: \noperations with major break in sterile technique (e.g. open cardiac massage) or \nsubstantial spillage (of gastrointestinal contents) from the gastrointestinal tract; \nand incisions in which acute, non-purulent inflammation is found, including \nnecrotic tissue, without evidence of purulent drainage such as dry gangrene.\n\u2022 Dirty or infected : old traumatic wounds with retained dead tissue and those that \ninvolve existing clinical infection or perforated viscera. Such wounds suggest that \nthe organisms causing postoperative infection were present at the site of the \nsurgery before the operation.564\nThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n40.

Surgical prophylaxis\nEpidemiology \nThe percentage of surgical site infections varies depending on the type of surgical procedure. \nFor example, in 2017 in 13 European countries reporting data on > 600 000 surgical \nprocedures, the overall percentage of infections per 100 operations ranged from 0.5% after \nknee prosthesis surgery to 10.1% after colon surgery. For most types of surgery, more than \n80% of patients received antibiotic prophylaxis. The only exception was cholecystectomy \nfor which a lower percentage of patients received antibiotic prophylaxis \u2013 44% in case of \nlaparoscopic and 66% in case of open cholecystectomy (377) .\nAnother study included data collected in 2016 from more than 12 000 patients \nfrom 66 countries with different human development indexes; 10.2% of patients were from \ncountries with a low human development index. Overall, 12.3% of patients undergoing \ngastrointestinal surgery developed a surgical site infection within 30 days. However, \nstatistically significant differences in the incidence of surgical site infections were found \nbased on the human development indexes. In particular, the incidence of surgical site \ninfections was 9.4% in countries with a high human development index, 14.0% in countries \nwith a medium human development index and 23.2% in those with a low human \ndevelopment index. Patients in countries with a low human development index were 1.6 \ntimes more likely to develop an infection than patients in countries with a higher human \ndevelopment index (378) . Variation in infection rates was also found after caesarean sections \nwith rates of infections ranging from 3% to 11% in high-income countries compared to 3% \nto 24% in low- and middle-income countries (379) .\nSurgical site infections and surgical prophylaxis to prevent them are a frequent \ncause of antibiotic use in hospitals. The 2015 global point prevalence survey on antibiotic \nuse (reporting data from 303 hospitals in 53 countries) reported that on the day of the \nsurvey, 1.6% of admitted patients were receiving antibiotics for a postoperative surgical site \ninfection (291) . Of note, 34.4% of adult inpatients were receiving at least one antibiotic on the \nday of the survey. Of the total antibiotic prescriptions, 17.8% were for surgical prophylaxis. \nThe most frequently prescribed antibiotic was cefazolin, prescribed in 27.5% of patients \nreceiving surgical prophylaxis. Prolonged surgical prophylaxis (> 1 day) was common in all \nregions, ranging from 40.6% in Oceania to 86.3% in eastern Europe (291) .\nMost likely pathogens\nThe pathogens causing surgical site infections vary based on the type of surgical procedure \n(Table 40.1).The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 569HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n40.

This list is based on data from high-income settings and aims to give a general overview (380) . The distribution \nof the pathogens most frequently associated with surgical site infections may vary in other settings.\nAntibiotic prophylaxis\nThe choice of the antibiotic should be based on the type of surgical procedure because not \nall procedures are associated with the same risk of developing infection (Table 40.2).\nIn general, antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery where the most likely pathogens \ncausing infection are Gram-positive bacteria should consist of intravenous first- or second-Table 40.1  continuedThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 571HOSPITAL FACILITY   \uf067\n40. Surgical prophylaxis\ngeneration cephalosporins \u2013 cefazolin or, as an alternative second choice, cefuroxime. These \nsurgeries include clean procedures such as cardiac and vascular surgery but also procedures \nthat involve the placement of a prosthesis or implant.\nIf additional pathogens (e.g. anaerobes) could cause infection (e.g. in abdominal \nprocedures), antibiotic prophylaxis should be adapted accordingly. In these cases, cefazolin \nin combination with metronidazole would be an appropriate option. \nIn patients known to be colonized with MRSA and who will have a skin incision, \nvancomycin prophylaxis (in addition to the routine recommended antibiotic prophylaxis) \nmay be justified. This is recommended because vancomycin alone is less effective than \ncefazolin (the antibiotic recommended as prophylaxis in most surgical procedures) against \nmethicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus  and because vancomycin has no activity against \nGram-negative bacteria. It should be noted that in patients colonized with MRSA, procedure-\nspecific preventive measures other than antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g. nasal decolonization \nwith mupirocin ointment, skin antisepsis) may be beneficial but such measures are not \nspecifically addressed in this chapter. Please refer to the WHO guidelines for the prevention \nof surgical site infections (280)  for information on such preventive measures.\nIn the context of patients known to be colonized with multidrug-resistant Gram-\nnegative bacteria (e.g. bacteria producing ESBLs or carbapenemases), the WHO guidelines \nacknowledged a lack of high quality evidence to make recommendations on the need to \ninclude other antibiotics for prophylaxis to cover these pathogens (280) . However, certain \nfactors, such as the closeness of the likely reservoir of these bacteria to the operative site or \ncharacteristics of the patient, could help to make decision on a case-by-case basis.572 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  HOSPITAL FACILITY\n40.

At the same time, \nlimiting the duration to one single dose reduces the risk of selecting resistant bacteria in the \npatient\u2019s own microbiota and the risk of developing Clostridioides difficile  infections.\nOnly in certain cases may a further dose of antibiotic be required, such as for \nprolonged surgical procedures (exceeding about two times the half-life of the antibiotic) \nor when there is major blood loss (380) .

Use \nof any Reserve antibiotics in animals should be avoided wherever possible.\nReserve antibiotics can either be older off-patent antibiotics that have been \nreintroduced into clinical practice (e.g. polymyxin B, colistin, fosfomycin) or new antibiotics that \nhave been recently licensed for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacteria. It is important \nto note that not all antibiotics that have activity against strains of multidrug-resistant bacteria \nhave been included in the EML (8). Between 2017 and 2021, the list of Reserve antibiotics was \nupdated and some antibiotics were removed and others added to this group. Only antibiotics \nlisted on the EML and EMLc are considered essential for all health systems. 578 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS\n41. Overview\nThe EML needs to be continually updated as more evidence on the antibiotics in \nthe list and new antibiotics become available. The list of Reserve antibiotics in the 2021 EML \nis closely aligned with the WHO analysis of the clinical antibacterial pipeline (383) , which \nassesses how antibacterial drugs in the development pipeline address the WHO priority \npathogens list. Ideally an antibiotic under development will progress through the pipeline \nand, after licensing, would be considered for listing in the EML as a Reserve antibiotic.\nThe overarching principle for listing an antibiotic as a Reserve antibiotic in the EML is \nevidence of its usefulness to effectively treat a severe clinical infection for which the currently \navailable treatment options are very limited, indicating a clear unmet global public health \nneed. Other important considerations are strong evidence that the antibiotic has: better \nefficacy, safety and durability (low likelihood of selection of resistance on treatment) than \ncomparable medicines; low impact on the microbiome; and simplicity of administration. \nThere is therefore likely to be a range of Reserve antibiotics that cover different serious \nclinical infections. These antibiotics would include, for example, systemic antibiotics targeted \nat particular multidrug-resistant phenotypes (e.g. carbapenem-resistant organisms) or \ntargeted at important pathogens (e.g. Pseudomonas  spp. or Acinetobacter  spp.). Equally, \nthere is an important unmet clinical need for active oral drugs that can be used as targeted \ntreatment of multidrug-resistant pathogens (e.g. Klebsiella  spp.). This focus on public health \nemphasizes the importance for Reserve antibiotics to have phenotypic and genotypic \nactivity that is globally relevant. For example, Reserve antibiotics that are active against \ncarbapenem-resistant pathogens should ideally also have activity against the most common \ngenetic types identified in low- and middle-income countries, e.g. metallo-beta-lactamases.\nReserve antibiotics are considered the so-called last-resort antibiotics which are \nstill effective for the treatment of specific patient populations. There is a complex balance \nbetween using Reserve antibiotics effectively in sick patients where needed and their \noveruse potentially leading to a rapid decline in their effectiveness. The great majority of \nReserve antibiotics are intravenous and used in the hospital facility setting. There is wider \nuse of Reserve antibiotics in high-income countries than in low- and middle-income \ncountries, raising concerns about equity of access to Reserve antibiotics which are generally \nmore expensive than Access or Watch antibiotics. \nTherefore, these antibiotics should be available for clinical care when needed but \nused only in certain situations where their use is likely to have clear clinical benefits. Reserve \nantibiotics are ideally used for targeted  treatment once multidrug-resistant bacteria are \nconfirmed; for example, following laboratory identification of the pathogen from a blood \nculture and susceptibility testing demonstrating wide multidrug resistance but sensitivity to \na Reserve antibiotic. However, high quality rapid culture and sensitivity data are often not \navailable in many settings and identification of a pathogen may not always be feasible even \nwith access to state-of-the-art microbiologic techniques. The AWaRe book focuses on empiric \ntreatment when diagnostic test results, including microbiological cultures, are not available. The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 579RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS   \uf067\n41. Overview\nReserve antibiotics could be considered for empiric therapy in very select cases where a \nmultidrug-resistant pathogen as the cause of the infection can be strongly suspected based \non the clinical infection, local microbiology, previous treatment or known colonization with a \nmultidrug-resistant pathogen. \nReserve antibiotics are not listed as first- or second-choice options for any of the \ninfections included in the AWaRe book. However, to help with the appropriate use of Reserve \nantibiotics, a comment about their potential role for empiric therapy has been added to \nspecific chapters where they are most likely to be used, for example, for severe hospital-\nacquired infections or severe infections in patients who have received multiple antibiotic \ntreatments in the recent past. The risks and benefits of treatment need to be carefully \nconsidered in high-risk patient populations with multidrug-resistant infections that have \na high associated mortality. Some antibiotics on the Reserve list have substantial toxicity \nbut may still be used for treatment if there are no or few other treatment options and the \nrisk of death or permanent sequelae due to the infection are high. Ensuring the optimal \nuse of Reserve antibiotics is complex and difficult at both a patient and country level, but \ncontrol of the use of Reserve antibiotics is critical to maintaining their future effectiveness. \nFor example, colistin in South Africa is only authorized for use if specific criteria are met and \nwith approval from the Medicines Control Council, as in section 21 of the Medicines and \nRelated Substances Act 101 of 1965 (384) . \nThe need for stewardship of Reserve antibiotics and what countries should do to \ncontribute to good stewardship are outlined in Box 41.1.\nBox 41.1 \u2013 Reserve antibiotic stewardship\n\u2022 Preserving the effectiveness of Reserve antibiotics (i.e. preventing the development of \nresistance to these antibiotics in the future) is key to maintaining their longevity in clinical \nuse. \n\u2022 Therefore, all efforts should be made to ensure careful use of Reserve antibiotics within local \nand national stewardship strategies, which should include routine local and/or national \nmonitoring and reporting of their use.\n\u2022 Countries should consider developing formal guidance on and control of the use of Reserve \nantibiotics at a national and local level, including through medicines regulation.\nPrescribers need to recognize the very limited data available on the clinical \nefficacy of most Reserve antibiotics in treating multidrug-resistant infections. Regulatory \napproval is usually obtained through non-inferiority trials (usually trials on complicated \nUTI and/or complicated intraabdominal infections) containing few high-risk patients \nwith multidrug-resistant infections. Vulnerable patient populations at particular risk for \ninfections by multidrug-resistant pathogens such as the very young, the very old and 580 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS\n41. Overview\nimmunocompromised individuals are often underrepresented in these trials. Therefore, the \neffectiveness of these new molecules on multidrug-resistant isolates is often based on in vitro \ndata or case reports and retrospective observational studies with a high inherent risk of bias. \nFurthermore, recruitment of patients with carbapenem-resistant pathogens into pathogen-\nfocused or limited-population trials has been difficult, which has led to estimates of clinical \nefficacy based on small studies. Strategic comparative public health-focused (rather than \nregulatory) trials for multidrug-resistant infections that directly compare multiple agents in \nhigh-risk populations for clinical efficacy, toxicity, resistance and health economic outcomes \nare urgently needed to inform the serious unmet public health priorities in this critical area.\nThe expected activity of Reserve antibiotics against beta-lactamase-producing \nbacteria are shown in Table 41.1.\nTable 41.1 \u2013 Expected activity of Reserve antibiotics against third-generation \ncephalosporin- and carbapenem-resistant bacteria based on the type of beta-\nlactamase produced\nType of beta-\nlactamase ESBLaKPCbNDM, VIM, \nIMPbAmpC OXA-48bNon-fermentersc\nAmbler classdAeAeB\n(MBLs)CeDeNA\nCefiderocol + + + + + +f\nCeftazidime+  \navibactam+ + \u2013 + + \u2013\nAcinetobacter \nbaumannii\n+\nPseudomonas \naeruginosa\nFosfomycin (IV)\n(consider \nusing only in \ncombination \ntherapy) + +/\u2013 +/\u2013 + +/\u2013 \u2013\nAcinetobacter \nbaumannii\n+/\u2013\nPseudomonas \naeruginosa\nMeropenem+  \nvaborbactam+ + \u2013 + \u2013 +/\u2013\ncontinuesThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 581RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS   \uf067\n41.

Siderophore-antibiotic \nconjugates exploit the ability of siderophores to bind extracellular free iron and use \niron transporters to cross bacterial cell membranes (in the case of cefiderocol the outer \nmembrane of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria), which results in active accumulation of the \nantibiotic at the site of action. In addition, cefiderocol can also enter the bacterial cell by \npassively diffusing through porin channels similar to other beta-lactams.\nCefiderocol has been licensed for the treatment of complicated UTIs, hospital-\nacquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in patients \n18 years or older. Its indications include severe infections caused by certain strains of \ncarbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and Acinetobacter \nbaumannii  depending on the type of carbapenemase produced and the resistance \nmechanism in patients with limited treatment options.\nThe primary use of cefiderocol is for the treatment of infections caused by metallo-\nbeta-lactamases-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales for which alternative \ntreatment options are very limited (at the time of publication of the AWaRe book).\nParticular caution is needed in patients with Acinetobacter baumannii  infections \nbecause of concerning data from a randomized clinical trial that reported higher mortality \nwith cefiderocol in this patient population (385,386) .\nIts current indications in the EML and EMLc (8,9)  include infections caused by certain \nstrains of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa  depending \non the type of carbapenemase produced and the resistance mechanism.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book583\nRESERVE ANTIBIOTICS   \uf067\n42.

Cefiderocol\nAdministration\nCefiderocol is currently available as powder for intravenous infusion (1 g/vial). It is \nadministered by intravenous infusion over 3 hours. \nMechanism of action\nCefiderocol acts by inhibiting bacterial enzymes responsible for cell-wall synthesis, primarily \npenicillin-binding proteins. This leads to cell lysis and death.\nSpectrum of activity\nCefiderocol is only active against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (Table 42.1). Specifically, \nit is active against many carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas aeruginosa  \nand Acinetobacter baumannii  clinical isolates. Cefiderocol has no, or only limited, activity \nagainst Gram-positive bacteria or anaerobes.\nIn vitro, cefiderocol is not degraded by ESBL and by certain types of carbapenemase, \nin particular Klebsiella pneumoniae  carbapenemases, oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48) beta-\nlactamases and metallo-beta-lactamases such as New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases, \nVerona integron-encoded, or imipenemase metallo-beta-lactamases. \nOf note, cefiderocol is one of the few Reserve antibiotics with reported \nactivity against metallo-beta-lactamases. The other such antibiotics are colistin/\npolymyxin B, fosfomycin and aztreonam combined with avibactam, in the form of \nceftazidime+avibactam.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 585RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS   \uf067\n42.

The most relevant \nin this context are Acinetobacter baumannii  and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . When using this table, always consider \nthat even when activity of a certain Reserve antibiotic is reported against carbapenem-resistant non-fermenters, \nthis ultimately depends on the type of carbapenemase produced and the resistance mechanism.\nd The Ambler classification of beta-lactamases is the most widely used classification. According to this classification \nbeta-lactamases are divided into four classes (A, B, C and D) based upon similarities in their amino acid sequence.\ne Ambler class A, C and D are serine beta-lactamases.\nf Higher mortality has been reported with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii  infections.\nClinical efficacy\nAt the time of publication of the AWaRe book, three randomized clinical trials had assessed \nthe efficacy and safety of cefiderocol in adults (385,387,388) . The results of these trials provide \nevidence that cefiderocol is not inferior to carbapenems for the treatment of infections \ncaused by Gram-negative bacteria (not specifically multidrug-resistant) particularly for \ncomplicated UTIs, HAP including VAP and bloodstream infections or sepsis.\nOne study that enrolled 150 patients with confirmed carbapenem-resistant Gram-\nnegative infection and compared cefiderocol to the best available therapy reported higher \nmortality in the cefiderocol group, which appeared to be driven by a worse outcome in \nthe subgroup of patients with Acinetobacter baumannii  infections (385) . Mortality at day \n28 was 24.8% (25/101) in the cefiderocol group versus 18.4% (9/49) in the best available \ntherapy group (difference 6.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI): \u22128.6% to 19.2%). The \nstatistically significant difference persisted at day 49: 34/101 (33.7%) in the cefiderocol \ngroup versus 10/49 (20.4%) in the best available therapy group; difference 13.3%, 95% CI: \n\u22122.5% to 26.9%.586 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS\n42. Cefiderocol\nA possible explanation given by the authors for this difference was that, despite \nrandomization, a higher mortality risk was present at the time of randomization in the \ncefiderocol group; for example, more patients were in the intensive care unit or had \nexperienced shock in the month preceding randomization. The increase in mortality remains, \nhowever, a major concern in this patient population and requires further investigation in \nclinical trials.\nAlthough very small numbers of patients with metallo-beta-lactamase-producing \nEnterobacterales were included in these trials, outcomes in this group of patients were \nfavourable. \nAt the time of publication of the AWaRe book, cefiderocol is being assessed in phase \nII trials (i.e. trials that assess safety and effectiveness in small groups of patients) in children \nand good evidence about its efficacy and safety in the paediatric setting is lacking.\nToxicity\nCefiderocol has a good safety profile similar to other beta-lactams and is well tolerated. In \nclinical trials, side-effects were described in proportions similar to those experienced by \npatients in control groups. Gastrointestinal effects (e.g. diarrhoea) are the most commonly \nreported side-effects.\nDose \nCefiderocol requires dose adjustments in cases of renal impairment (Table 42.2). Renal function \nshould be closely monitored and doses adjusted accordingly. Dose adjustments are not \ncovered in the AWaRe book. Please also refer to the chapter on dosing for more information.\nTable 42.2 \u2013 Cefiderocol suggested doses\nDose in adults Dose in children Dose in neonates\n2 g given every 8 hours There are no data for \nchildren or neonatesThere are no data for \nchildren or neonates\nNote. All dosages are for normal renal and hepatic function.\nIndication for the use as a Reserve antibiotic\nTargeted treatment\nCefiderocol could be considered as a last-resort option for the targeted treatment of \nsevere invasive infections (e.g. positive blood culture) caused by laboratory-confirmed The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 587RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS   \uf067\n42. Cefiderocol\ncarbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , particularly if the \nresistance is caused by metallo-beta-lactamases. The use of cefiderocol should be limited to \nsituations where no other adequate therapeutic options are available. Given the increased \nmortality observed in the trial mentioned before (385) , cefiderocol should be used with \ncaution in patients with Acinetobacter baumannii  infection.\nTo preserve its effectiveness (i.e. to prevent the development of resistance), \ncefiderocol should not be used to treat infections caused by isolates only producing ESBLs \nwhen there are other options available.\nEmpiric treatment\nCefiderocol could be considered for empiric use exceptionally in very select cases of seriously \nill patients with invasive infections (e.g. patients with sepsis/septic shock) including the \nfollowing patients.\n\u2022 Patients who have not responded to carbapenems if: (i) other causes of treatment \nfailure have been excluded first, and (ii) there is a strong suspicion that the \ninfection is caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria, especially in settings \nwith a high prevalence of metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. \nHowever, if a patient is not improving, antibiotic failure is not the only possible \ncause to consider. Alternative reasons include: alternative diagnosis; development \nof complications (e.g. an abscess); inadequate control of the source of infection; \nsuboptimal dose of the antibiotic; or impossibility for the antibiotic to reach an \nadequate concentration at the site of infection. These possible causes of the lack \nof improvement in a patient are always important to consider before changing or \nadding new antibiotics.\n\u2022 Patients who have previously been treated for infections caused by carbapenem-\nresistant bacteria that are susceptible only to cefiderocol.\n\u2022 Patients who are known to be colonized with carbapenem-resistant bacteria \nfound to be susceptible only to cefiderocol.\nTo help prescribers identify clinical scenarios where empiric use of Reserve antibiotics \ncould exceptionally be considered, suggestions are given in the relevant chapters of the \nAWaRe book for certain infections \u2013 only for infections where empiric use could potentially \nbe adequate on a case-by-case basis.588 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS\n42. Cefiderocol\nEmerging resistance in Enterobacterales, \nPseudomonas aeruginosa  and Acinetobacter \nbaumannii\nMost Gram-negative bacteria are susceptible to cefiderocol. However, at the time of \npublication of the AWaRe book, few data were available about resistance. Most evidence \ncomes from two laboratory surveillance studies that tested the in vitro activity of cefiderocol \nin more than 30 000 Gram-negative aerobic isolates (years 2014\u20132017) and showed that \ncefiderocol was effective at low minimum inhibitory concentrations for more than 99% \nof isolates (389,390) . An increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations to cefiderocol has \nemerged on treatment in a small proportion of patients in trials. \nData on resistance to cefiderocol are currently not reported by the GLASS.\nDuration\nTreatment duration varies according to indication and should be as short as possible, usually \nbetween 7 and 14 days.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 589RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS   \uf067\n43. Ceftazidime+avibactam\nKey messages\n\u2022 Ceftazidime+avibactam has activity against many carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales \nand Pseudomonas aeruginosa , but not strains producing metallo-beta-lactamases.\n\u2022 When used to treat complicated intra-abdominal infections it should be given with \nmetronidazole due to its inconsistent activity against anaerobes.\nCeftazidime+avibactam is a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftazidime) \nin clinical use since the 1980s and a new non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor \n(avibactam). Its current indications in the EML and EMLc (8,9)  include infections caused \nby certain strains of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa  \ndepending on the type of carbapenemase produced and the resistance mechanism. Its \nactivity against Acinetobacter baumannii  is limited.\nAdministration\nCeftazidime+avibactam is currently available as powder for intravenous infusion (2 g + 0.5 g  \nin vial). It is administered by intravenous infusion over 2 hours. \nMechanism of action\nCeftazidime acts by inhibiting bacterial enzymes responsible for cell-wall synthesis, primarily \npenicillin binding protein 3. Avibactam targets the site of certain serine beta-lactamases \nand inactivates them, thus protecting ceftazidime from degradation.590\nThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS\n42.

Ceftazidime+avibactam\nSpectrum of activity\nCeftazidime+avibactam is mainly active against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Specifically, \nit is active against ceftazidime-resistant and many carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and \nPseudomonas aeruginosa  clinical isolates, but its activity against Acinetobacter  spp. is limited.\nAvibactam inhibits the activity of ESBLs, AmpC beta-lactamases, Klebsiella pneumoniae  \ncarbapenemases and OXA-48 beta-lactamases (Table 43.1), and so preserves the activity of \nceftazidime against many multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. However, avibactam \ndoes not inhibit the activity of metallo-beta-lactamases such as New Delhi metallo-beta-\nlactamase, Verona integron-encoded, or imipenemase metallo-beta-lactamases and \ntherefore ceftazidime is inactive against strains expressing these beta-lactamases.\nCeftazidime+avibactam also has some antistreptococcal activity, very limited \nantistaphylococcal activity and no antienterococcal activity.

According to this classification \nbeta-lactamases are divided into four classes (A, B, C and D) based upon similarities in their amino acid sequence.\ne Ambler class A, C and D are serine beta-lactamases.\nf Ceftazidime+avibactam co-prescribed with aztreonam retains activity against metallo-beta-lactamase-producing \nbacteria, however aztreonam is not currently listed in the WHO EML and EMLc.\nClinical efficacy\nSeveral clinical trials have assessed the efficacy and safety of ceftazidime+avibactam in \nadults and provide evidence that it is not inferior to carbapenems for the treatment of \ninfections caused by Gram-negative bacteria particularly for: complicated UTIs (391,392) ; \ncomplicated intra-abdominal infections in combination with metronidazole (392\u2013394) ; and \nHAP (395) . Of note, in the majority of trials, the infection being caused by multidrug-resistant \norganisms was not an inclusion criterion. In children, at the time of publication of the AWaRe \nbook, ceftazidime+avibactam has been assessed in phase II trials (i.e. trials that assess \nsafety and effectiveness in small groups of patients) for the treatment of complicated UTIs, \ncompared with cefepime (396) , and in combination with metronidazole for the treatment of \ncomplicated intra-abdominal infections, compared with meropenem (397) .\nIn both studies, ceftazidime+avibactam was well tolerated with a safety profile \nsimilar to that of ceftazidime alone and appeared effective in children with complicated \nurinary or intra-abdominal infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens.\nToxicity\nCeftazidime+avibactam is well tolerated and has side-effects similar to those previously reported \nfor ceftazidime alone. The most frequent side-effects are diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.\nDose \nCeftazidime+avibactam requires dose adjustments in cases of renal impairment (Table \n43.2). Renal function should be closely monitored, and doses adjusted accordingly. Please \nalso refer to the chapter on dosing for more information.Table 43.1  continuedThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 593RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS   \uf067\n43.

All dosages are for normal renal and hepatic function.\nIndication for use as a Reserve antibiotic\nTargeted treatment\nCeftazidime+avibactam could be considered as a last-resort option for the targeted \ntreatment of severe invasive infections (e.g. septic shock with positive blood culture) \ncaused by laboratory-confirmed carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales or Pseudomonas \naeruginosa  (not Acinetobacter baumannii ), including infections caused by strains producing \ncertain carbapenemases that have tested susceptible to this antibiotic.\nCeftazidime+avibactam is not indicated for infections caused by strains producing \nmetallo-beta-lactamases. Sometimes ceftazidime+avibactam is combined with aztreonam \nfor these strains but the evidence remains limited. \nIf ceftazidime+avibactam is used to treat intra-abdominal infections, it should \nbe used as part of a combination treatment because it lacks activity against anaerobic \norganisms \u2013 therefore it is usually used in combination with metronidazole. \nTo preserve its effectiveness (i.e. to prevent the development of resistance), \nceftazidime+avibactam should not be used to treat infections caused by isolates only \nproducing ESBLs or by ceftazidime-resistant bacteria when there are other options available.\nEmpiric treatment\nCeftazidime+avibactam could be considered for empiric use exceptionally in very select \ncases of seriously ill patients with invasive infections (e.g. patients with sepsis/septic \nshock without microbiological test results) suspected to be caused by a multidrug-\nresistant pathogen (e.g. severe hospital-acquired infections or infections in patients who \nhave received multiple antibiotic treatments in the recent past), such as in the following \nsituations.\n\u2022 Patients who have not responded to carbapenems if other causes of treatment \nfailure have been excluded first and there is a strong suspicion that the infection 594 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS\n43. Ceftazidime+avibactam\nis caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria. Since ceftazidime+avibactam \nis not active against metallo-beta-lactamases conveying carbapenem \nresistance, it is important to know the most prevalent genotypic variants \nthat are circulating of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria in the setting where \nthe patient acquired the infection. However, if a patient is not improving, \nantibiotic failure is not the only possible cause to consider. Alternative reasons \ninclude, for example: alternative diagnosis; development of complications (e.g. \nan abscess); inadequate source control; sub-optimal dose of the antibiotic; \nor impossibility for the antibiotic to reach an adequate concentration at the \nsite of infection. Alternative reasons are always important to consider before \nchanging or adding new antibiotics.\n\u2022 Patients who have previously been treated for infections caused by carbapenem-\nresistant bacteria.\n\u2022 Patients who are known to be colonized with carbapenem-resistant bacteria \nfound to be susceptible to ceftazidime+avibactam. \nTo help prescribers identify clinical situations where empiric use of Reserve antibiotics \ncould exceptionally be considered, suggestions are given in the relevant chapters of the \nAWaRe book for selected infections (only for infections where empiric use could potentially \nbe adequate on a case-by-case basis).\nEmerging resistance in Enterobacterales and \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\nMost Klebsiella pneumoniae  carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas \naeruginosa  are still susceptible to ceftazidime+avibactam. The proportion of isolates resistant \nto ceftazidime+avibactam is low (higher for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ) with variability \nacross geographical regions (398,399) . Data on resistance to ceftazidime+avibactam are \ncurrently not reported by the GLASS.

Fosfomycin (intravenous)\nSpectrum of activity\nFosfomycin is active against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria but not as a \nsingle agent against Streptococcus  spp., or Acinetobacter  spp. or anaerobic bacteria. Specifically, \nit is usually active against Enterococcus  spp. (including vancomycin-resistant strains), \nStaphylococcus aureus  (including methicillin-resistant strains) and Staphylococcus epidermidis . \nIt is also active against Gram-negative Enterobacterales (including ESBL-producing strains); \nhowever, activity against carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemases-producing strains is \nvariable (Table 44.1). Fosfomycin\u2019s activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa  is variable.\nTable 44.1 \u2013 Expected activity of intravenous fosfomycin against third-generation \ncephalosporin and carbapenem-resistant bacteria based on the type of beta-\nlactamase produced\nType of beta-\nlactamase ESBLaKPCbNDM, VIM, \nIMPbAmpC OXA-48bNon-fermentersc\nAmbler classdAeAeB\n(MBLs)CeDeNA\nExpected \nactivity of IV \nfosfomycin\n(Consider \nusing only in \ncombination \ntherapy)+ +/\u2013 +/\u2013 + +/\u2013 \u2013\nAcinetobacter \nbaumannii\n+/\u2013\nPseudomonas \naeruginosa\nAmpC: ampicillinase C; ESBL: extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; IMP: imipenemase; IV: intravenous; KPC: \nKlebsiella pneumoniae  carbapenemase; MBLs: metallo-beta-lactamases; NA: not applicable; NDM: New Delhi \nmetallo-beta-lactamase; OXA-48: oxacillinase-48; VIM: Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase.\nExpected activity : + active; +/\u2013 possibly active; \u2013 not or insufficiently active.\na ESBL are a group of different beta-lactamases.\nb Carbapenemases.\nc Non-fermenters refer to bacteria that cannot catabolize glucose and thus are unable to ferment. The most relevant \nin this context are Acinetobacter baumannii  and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . When using this table, always consider \nthat even when activity of a certain Reserve antibiotic is reported against carbapenem-resistant non-fermenters, \nthis ultimately depends on the type of carbapenemase produced and the resistance mechanism.\nd The Ambler classification of beta-lactamases is the most widely used classification. According to this classification \nbeta-lactamases are divided into four classes (A, B, C and D) based upon similarities in their amino acid sequence.\ne Ambler class A, C and D are serine beta-lactamases.598 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS\n44. Fosfomycin (intravenous)\nClinical efficacy\nIntravenous fosfomycin could be considered for the treatment of certain severe infections \nwhen other antibiotics cannot be used or are not effective. It is usually used as part of \ncombination treatments, mostly because of concerns about the emergence of resistance \nwhen used alone. The benefits of combination treatment compared with monotherapy in \nterms of better clinical efficacy are unclear as there is limited clinical evidence (402,403) .\nFew clinical trials have assessed the efficacy and safety of fosfomycin (intravenous) \nin adults. Fosfomycin has been assessed for the treatment of complicated UTIs and the \nresults showed that fosfomycin was not inferior to piperacillin+tazobactam (404) . Another \nnon-inferiority trial which compared fosfomycin with meropenem and ceftriaxone has \nrecently been completed (405) . Fosfomycin has also been evaluated for the treatment of \nMRSA bacteraemia and endocarditis in combination with daptomycin and this combination \nwas more effective than daptomycin alone (406) . \nOther evidence in support of the use of fosfomycin for difficult-to-treat \nStaphylococcus aureus  infections (including MRSA) exists but it is anecdotal and inconclusive. \nThis evidence is mostly from observational and in-vitro studies, including results from a \nclinical trial comparing fosfomycin (in combination with imipenem) to vancomycin alone \nfor the treatment of complicated MRSA bacteraemia and endocarditis; however, this study \nfailed to reach an adequate sample size (407) .\nIn children, the evidence is even more limited. One pharmacokinetic and safety trial \nhas recently been completed of fosfomycin as an empiric treatment in neonatal sepsis (408) .\nThe use of fosfomycin for other indications (e.g. bone and joint infections, hospital-\nacquired pneumonia, meningitis and abdominal infections) relies on evidence from case \nreports or other observational and in vitro studies which is therefore less robust.\nToxicity\nFosfomycin is well tolerated. However, use of the intravenous formulation can be associated \nwith sodium overload related to the sodium salt formulation (this could be of concern \nin patients with heart failure) and hypokalaemia (therefore potassium levels should be \nregularly monitored).\nDose \nThe optimal intravenous dose still needs to be clearly defined (Table 44.2). Usually, doses \nvary with the severity of the disease and the patient\u2019s renal function. Dose adjustments are \nnecessary in cases of renal impairment. Please also refer to the chapter on dosing for more \ninformation.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 599RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS   \uf067\n44. Fosfomycin (intravenous)\nTable 44.2 \u2013 Fosfomycin suggested doses\nDose in adults Dose in children\nIV: 6 g given every 8 hours\n(Note.

All dosages are for normal renal and hepatic function.\nIndication for use as a Reserve antibiotic\nTargeted treatment\nFosfomycin (usually as part of combination therapy to reduce the risk of the development of \nresistance) could be considered in the following cases.\n\u2022 As a last-resort option for the targeted treatment of severe infections caused by \nlaboratory-confirmed carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales or Pseudomonas \naeruginosa  (including strains producing carbapenemases) that have been shown \nto be susceptible to this antibiotic. Caution is needed with infections caused by \nPseudomonas aeruginosa  because the activity of fosfomycin against this pathogen \nis variable. \n\u2022 As a last-resort option for difficult-to-treat infections caused by Staphylococcus \naureus  (including MRSA) and Enterococcus  spp., including vancomycin-resistant \nstrains. However, the 2021 version of the EML and EMLc does not include this use.\nEmpiric treatment\nUsually as part of combination therapy, fosfomycin could be considered for empiric use \nin selected cases of seriously ill patients with invasive infections (e.g. patients with sepsis/\nseptic shock) suspected to be caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen (e.g. severe \nhospital-acquired infections or infections in patients who have received multiple antibiotic \ntreatments in the recent past) such as in the following situations.\n\u2022 Patients who have not responded to carbapenems if other causes of treatment \nfailure have been excluded first and there is a strong suspicion that the \ninfection is caused by a carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales \u2013 fosfomycin \ndoes not reliably treat Acinetobacter  spp. and its activity against Pseudomonas 600 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS\n44. Fosfomycin (intravenous)\naeruginosa  is variable. However, if a patient is not improving, antibiotic failure \nis not the only possible cause to consider. Alternative reasons include, for \nexample: alternative diagnosis, development of complications (e.g. an abscess), \ninadequate source control, sub-optimal dose of the antibiotic or impossibility \nfor the antibiotic to reach an adequate concentration at the site of infection. \nAlternative reasons are always important to consider before changing or \nadding new antibiotics.\n\u2022 Patients who have previously been treated for infections caused by carbapenem-\nresistant Enterobacterales. In certain settings Klebsiella pneumoniae  may be \nresistant to fosfomycin; therefore, local knowledge of susceptibility profiles for \naerobic Gram-negative bacteria is crucial (409). Fosfomycin does not reliably treat \nAcinetobacter  spp. and its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa  is variable.\n\u2022 Patients who are known to be colonized with carbapenem-resistant pathogens \nfound to be susceptible to fosfomycin.\nTo help prescribers identify clinical scenarios where empiric use of Reserve antibiotics \ncould exceptionally be considered, suggestions are given in the relevant chapters of the \nAWaRe book for selected infections (only for infections where empiric use could potentially \nbe adequate on a case-by-case basis).\nEmerging resistance in Enterobacterales\nCross-resistance is uncommon because of the unique structure and mechanism of action \nof fosfomycin. Both chromosomal-mediated and plasmid-mediated (i.e. transmissible) \nresistance can occur. Resistance can rapidly develop in vitro, but in clinical practice resistance \nis still uncommon, although it is increasing (410) .\nData on resistance to fosfomycin are currently not reported by the GLASS.\nDuration\nTreatment duration varies according to indication and should be as short as possible, usually \nbetween 7 and 14 days.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 601RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS   \uf067\n45.

Linezolid\nAdministration\nLinezolid is currently available as a solution for intravenous infusion (2 mg/mL in 300 mL \nbag) administered by intravenous infusion over 30\u2013120 minutes, and as an oral formulation \n(tablet: 400 mg; 600 mg). A neonatal or paediatric formulation is also available (powder for \noral liquid: 100 mg/5 mL). The high oral bioavailability of linezolid allows initiation with oral \ntreatment as an alternative to intravenous treatment.\nGeneric versions of linezolid are available.\nMechanism of action\nLinezolid acts by binding to the 50S unit of the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting the synthesis \nof bacterial proteins. \nSpectrum of activity\nLinezolid is mainly active against aerobic Gram-positive bacteria. In particular against \nmost clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus  spp., MRSA and penicillin non-\nsusceptible pneumococci. In addition, linezolid has some bactericidal activity against \nMycobacterium tuberculosis  including extensively drug-resistant strains and certain non-\ntuberculous mycobacteria. \nLinezolid is not indicated for the treatment of Gram-negative infections. Even \nthough linezolid has some in vitro activity against certain Gram-negative and anaerobic \nbacteria, clinical data are limited and its use is not recommended for the treatment of these \npathogens.\nClinical efficacy\nSeveral clinical trials have assessed the efficacy and safety of linezolid compared to \nvancomycin for the treatment of MRSA infections in general (411)  and for skin and soft tissue \ninfections in particular, including those caused by MRSA (412) . Linezolid was associated \nwith better short-term survival compared to daptomycin for the treatment of bloodstream \ninfections caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus  spp. (413\u2013415) . However, linezolid\u2019s \noverall superiority to daptomycin is less clear because a large cohort study showed greater \ntreatment failure and short-term mortality with linezolid than daptomycin (416) . With \nhealth care-associated pneumonia, the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis did \nnot show a clear benefit of linezolid for clinical cure or microbiological eradication when \ncompared to vancomycin or teicoplanin, and linezolid was associated with more side-\neffects (417) . 604 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS\n45. Linezolid\nLinezolid can also be used as part of a longer regimen (longer than the standard TB \ntreatment duration) for the treatment of patients with multidrug- and rifampicin-resistant \nTB as indicated in WHO guidelines for treatment of drug-resistant TB (418) .\nToxicity\nLinezolid is generally well tolerated; however, it can cause myelosuppression (mostly \nthrombocytopenia but also anaemia or leukopenia), which is usually reversible when \nlinezolid is stopped. Therefore, a complete blood cell count should be done weekly, especially \nin high-risk patients, such as those with pre-existing myelosuppression or concomitant use \nof medicines that cause bone marrow suppression. As with any other medicine, interactions \nwith other medicines should be checked before prescribing linezolid; this topic is, however, \nnot addressed in the AWaRe book. Severe optic neuropathy can occur rarely, particularly if \nlinezolid is used for more than 28 days. Patients should be advised to report all new visual \nsymptoms. Peripheral neuropathy is also rarely associated with the (prolonged) use of \nlinezolid. The risk of side-effects increases with prolonged use (usually > 4 weeks), which \nshould be avoided unless there are no alternatives.\nDose \nLinezolid does not require dose adjustments in case of renal impairment (Table 45.1). Please \nalso refer to the chapter on dosing for more information.\nTable 45.1 \u2013 Linezolid suggested doses\nDose in adults Dose in children Dose in neonates\n600 mg given every 12 hours 10 mg/kg/dose given every \n8 hours10 mg/kg/dose given every \n12 hours (first week of life) \nor every 8 hours (> first \nweek of life)\nNote. All dosages are for normal renal and hepatic function.\nIndication for use as a Reserve antibiotic\nLinezolid can be considered in the following situations.\n\u2022 Oral treatment for MRSA is necessary and other less expensive oral alternatives \nto linezolid are not indicated or are likely to be ineffective due to resistance or \ntoxicity concerns. The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 605RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS   \uf067\n45. Linezolid\n -Oral treatment may be necessary when maintaining access to parenteral \ntreatment is difficult or for switching from intravenous to oral treatment when \nthe patient could be discharged from hospital before the planned treatment \ncourse is completed.\n -In case of documented hypersensitivity to vancomycin. \n\u2022 In case of severe renal impairment.\n\u2022 In case of infections caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus  spp. or \nStaphylococcus aureus .\n\u2022 In very select cases of seriously ill patients with invasive infections that are known to \nbe colonized with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus  spp. or Staphylococcus aureus .\n\u2022 As a second-line option for the treatment of mycobacterial infections, including \nextensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis  as recommended in WHO \nguidelines (418) . \nWhen using linezolid, the risk of side-effects (mostly thrombocytopenia), especially \nwith prolonged use, should always be taken into account. Because of this and because of \nthe risk of emergence of resistance, linezolid use as Reserve antibiotic should be limited to \nwell defined patient populations and be as short as possible.\nEmerging resistance in Gram-positive bacteria\nResistance to linezolid in usually susceptible Gram-positive bacteria most commonly arises \nthrough mutations in the bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA, but it can also be transmitted \nthrough plasmids. Resistance can develop in the absence of prior treatment with linezolid \nand also after short periods of exposure to the antibiotic and should be carefully monitored.\nResistant isolates of enterococci, staphylococci and streptococci have been reported \nworldwide but their proportion remains low and in general; most Gram-positive bacteria are \nstill susceptible to linezolid (419) . Selection for resistance could be favoured by suboptimal \ndosing of the antibiotic, especially in severely ill patients where volumes of distribution may \nbe higher leading to low plasma levels (420) .\nData on resistance to linezolid are currently not reported by the GLASS.\nDuration\nTreatment duration varies according to indication and should be as short as possible. \nProlonged treatment (> 4 weeks) should be avoided whenever possible because of \nincreased risk of toxicity (see toxicity section).606 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS\n46. Meropenem+vaborbactam\nKey messages\n\u2022 Meropenem+vaborbactam has activity against many carbapenem-resistant \nEnterobacterales, especially those producing Klebsiella pneumoniae  carbapenemases, but \nnot strains producing metallo-beta-lactamases and oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48).\n\u2022 Meropenem+vaborbactam is currently not licenced for use in children.\nMeropenem+vaborbactam is a combination of a carbapenem (meropenem) and a new \nnon-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor (vaborbactam). Its current indications in the \nEML include infections caused by certain strains of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, \nAcinetobacter baumannii  and Pseudomonas aeruginosa  (8). Its activity varies depending on \nthe type of carbapenemase produced and the resistance mechanism.\nHowever, for most strains of Acinetobacter baumannii  and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , \nthe addition of vaborbactam to meropenem has no additional advantage over meropenem \nalone because of the presence of different resistance mechanisms. Therefore, activity of \nmeropenem + vaborbactam against these pathogens is limited.\nAdministration\nMeropenem+vaborbactam is currently available as powder for intravenous infusion (1 g + 1 g \nin vial). It should be administered by intravenous infusion over 3 hours.\nMechanism of action\nMeropenem+vaborbactam acts by inhibiting bacterial enzymes responsible for cell wall \nsynthesis, primarily penicillin-binding proteins. Vaborbactam targets the site of certain \nserine beta-lactamases (Ambler class B) and inactivates them, thus protecting meropenem \nfrom degradation.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book607\nRESERVE ANTIBIOTICS   \uf067\n46.

In particular, \nvaborbactam inhibits the activity of ESBLs, AmpC beta-lactamases and Klebsiella pneumoniae  \ncarbapenemases, and thus preserves the activity of meropenem against many multidrug-\nresistant Gram-negative bacteria (Table 46.1). However, vaborbactam does not inhibit the \nactivity of metallo-beta-lactamases and OXA-48 beta-lactamases and therefore meropenem \nis not active against strains expressing these beta-lactamases (Table 46.1).\nTable 46.1 \u2013 Expected activity of meropenem+vaborbactam against third-\ngeneration cephalosporin and carbapenem-resistant bacteria based on the type \nof beta-lactamase produced\nType of beta-\nlactamase ESBLaKPCbNDM, VIM, \nIMPbAmpC OXA-48bNon-fermentersc\nAmbler classdAeAeB\n(MBLs)CeDeNA\nExpected \nactivity of \nmeropenem+ \nvaborbactam+ + \u2013 + \u2013 +/\u2013\nAmpC: ampicillinase C; ESBL: extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; IMP: imipenemase; KPC: Klebsiella pneumoniae  \ncarbapenemase; MBLs: metallo-beta-lactamases; NA: not applicable; NDM: New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase; \nOXA-48: oxacillinase-48; VIM: Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase.\nExpected activity : + active; +/\u2013 possibly active; \u2013 not or insufficiently active.\na ESBL are a group of different beta-lactamases.\nb Carbapenemases.\nc Non-fermenters refer to bacteria that cannot catabolize glucose and thus are unable to ferment.

For plazomicin, \nsome in vitro studies have shown activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa  similar to amikacin (426) .\nd The Ambler classification of beta-lactamases is the most widely used classification.

Plazomicin\nClinical efficacy\nPlazomicin can be considered as salvage therapy for otherwise untreatable carbapenem- \nresistant Gram-negative infections.\nEfficacy has been demonstrated only for the treatment of complicated UTIs in adults \nwhere plazomicin showed non-inferiority to meropenem (427) .\nVery limited evidence exists for the treatment of other types of infections \nand for its use in children. Plazomicin has also been compared with colistin as part of \ncombination therapy for the treatment of severe infections caused by carbapenem-resistant \nEnterobacterales, such as bacteraemia and hospital-acquired pneumonia (428) . The results \nof the study indicated that plazomicin reduced short-term mortality and disease-related \ncomplications, but the trial was stopped early because of major difficulties with enrolling \npatients. The study therefore provides only descriptive statistics and findings; as such its \nresults are inconclusive.\nToxicity\nPlazomicin can cause damage to the kidneys and ears, similar to other aminoglycosides. The \nrisk of nephrotoxicity is higher in older patients (> 65 years) and in patients with pre-existing \nrenal impairment; therefore, creatinine levels should be monitored regularly.\nDose \nWeight-based, once-daily dosing is used (Table 47.2).

However, if a patient is not improving, \nantibiotic failure is not the only possible cause to consider. Alternative reasons \ninclude: alternative diagnosis; development of complications (e.g. abscess); \ninadequate source control; suboptimal dosing of the antibiotic; or impossibility \nfor the antibiotic to reach an adequate concentration at the site of infection. \nAlternative reasons are always important to consider before changing or adding \nnew antibiotics.616 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS\n47.

However, unlike other \naminoglycosides, plazomicin maintains activity against most aminoglycoside-modifying \nenzymes \u2013 enzymes that can reduce the affinity of the antibiotic for its ribosomal target \nthrough a mechanism that is different from ribosomal modifications. Plasmid-mediated \nresistance (i.e. transmissible resistance) has also been described.\nData on resistance to plazomicin are currently not reported by the GLASS.\nDuration\nTreatment duration varies according to indication and should be as short as possible, usually \nbetween 7 and 14 days.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 617RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS   \uf067\n48. Polymyxin B and colistin \n(polymyxin E)\nKey messages\n\u2022 Polymyxin B and colistin have the same spectrum of activity that includes many strains \nof multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and \nAcinetobacter baumannii .\n\u2022 Polymyxin B and colistin are usually used as part of combination treatments; however, the \nonly currently available randomized clinical trial did not show superiority over monotherapy.\n\u2022 Great care must be taken to avoid dosing errors since doses can be given in different units \non labels and an initial loading dose is always necessary.\n\u2022 The main side-effect of polymyxin B and colistin is kidney damage, caused more often by \ncolistin than polymyxin B.\nPolymyxin B and colistin are polypeptides belonging to the polymyxin class of antibiotics. \nThese antibiotics became available for clinical use in the 1960s but were replaced by other \nclasses because of their unfavourable safety profile, notably nephrotoxicity. They have, \nhowever, been rediscovered in recent years because they retain activity against many \nstrains of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including carbapenemase-producing \nstrains. Polymyxin B and colistin have very similar chemical structures; however, polymyxin \nB is administered directly as the active antibiotic, while colistin is administered as inactive \nprodrug (sodium salt of colistin methane sulfonate also known as colistimethate). Since \ncolistimethate is produced by chemical modification of colistin molecules through addition \nof methanesulfonate moieties, there are many different partially methanesulfonated \nderivatives in a given product, which results in batch-to-batch (and brand-to-brand) \nvariation of the exact composition. Furthermore, there is important patient-to-patient \nvariation in the metabolism of colistimethate, making the pharmacokinetics of colistin \ndifficult to predict (429) . \nThe current indications for polymyxins B and colistin in the EML and EMLc include \ninfections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter baumannii  and \nPseudomonas aeruginosa  (8,9) .618\nThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS\n48.

The oral non-absorbable formulation of colistin (colistin \nsulfate) is not currently included in the EML and EMLc (8,9)  and therefore is not covered in \nthis chapter.\nMechanism of action\nPolymyxin B and colistin act by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane through interaction \nwith lipopolysaccharides present in the membranes of Gram-negative bacteria which thus \nleads to cell lysis. However, the exact mechanism is unknown. \nSpectrum of activity\nPolymyxin B and colistin have the same antibacterial spectrum and both are active only against \naerobic Gram-negative bacteria with no activity against anaerobes, Gram-positive bacteria and \nGram-negative cocci, for example, Neisseria  spp.. Polymyxins are active against many clinical \nisolates of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter  spp. and Pseudomonas \naeruginosa , including many of the isolates producing carbapenemases (Table 48.1).

The most relevant \nin this context are Acinetobacter baumannii  and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . When using this table, always consider \nthat even when activity of a certain Reserve antibiotic is reported against carbapenem-resistant non-fermenters, \nthis ultimately depends on the type of carbapenemase produced and the resistance mechanism.\nd The Ambler classification of beta-lactamases is the most widely used classification. According to this classification \nbeta-lactamases are divided into four classes (A, B, C and D) based upon similarities in their amino acid sequence.\ne Ambler class A, C and D are serine beta-lactamases.\nClinical efficacy\nPolymyxin B and colistin can be considered as salvage therapy for otherwise untreatable \ninfections caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.\nFor severe infections, they are usually given as part of combination therapy often \nwith high doses of carbapenems (but only if the minimum inhibitory concentration of \ncarbapenems is \u2264 8\u201316 mg/L) or in combination with other antibiotics depending on the \ntype of infection and in vitro susceptibility (430) . \nHowever, the only currently available randomized clinical trial did not show that \ncombination therapy was superior to colistin monotherapy for short-term clinical success \n\u2013 at least for infections caused by extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter  spp. It is unclear \nwhether this also applies to carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (431) . Evidence \nfrom observational studies is available but should be interpreted with caution due to the \ninherent methodological limitations (432,433) .\nPolymyxin B and colistin were approved for use decades ago and were therefore not \nsubjected to the same development process that would be required for the approval of a  622 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book\uf067  RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS\n48. Polymyxin B and colistin (polymyxin E)\nnew antibiotic today. This point should be kept in mind when interpreting data about their \nefficacy and safety, for example, current products of polymyxins may be less nephrotoxic \nthan those initially used (434) . There are recently licensed Reserve group beta-lactam/beta-\nlactamase inhibitor combinations (ceftazidime+avibactam, meropenem+vaborbactam) \nor siderophore-antibiotics (cefiderocol) available that some experts consider preferable to \npolymyxins because of their better safety profile and potentially better efficacy. However, \nthe evidence of their superiority is weak and access and affordability of these new antibiotics \nis a major issue in many low- and middle-income settings.\nToxicity\nThe use of polymyxin B and colistin can cause kidney damage (colistin is more likely to \ncause damage than polymyxin B) and, more rarely, neurotoxicity (e.g. paraesthesia). The \nside-effects are reversible in most cases and are associated with the cumulative dose and \nduration of therapy and use of concomitant medicines with similar toxicities.\nDose \nGreat care must be taken to avoid dosing errors with polymyxin B and colistin (Table 48.2 \nand Table 48.3). Errors can arise because doses can be given in different units on labels \n(435\u2013437) .\nPolymyxin B doses can be given in international units (IU) or milligrams. For example, \na dose of 1 million IU corresponds to 100 mg. \nColistin doses can be given in: IU of colistimethate sodium; mg of colistimethate \nsodium; or mg of colistin base activity. For example, a dose of 1 million IU of colistimethate \nsodium corresponds to 80 mg of colistimethate sodium and to 34 mg of colistin base activity.\nWhen using polymyxins, it is crucial to start therapy with a loading dose followed \nby maintenance dose after 12\u201324 hours. The reason is to more rapidly achieve plasma \nconcentrations that may be effective. In addition, for colistin (but not for polymyxin B), dose \nadjustments are necessary in cases of renal impairment (438) .\nFew data are available for dosing in children. Current evidence suggests that doses \napproved by regulatory agencies may be suboptimal for many children due to interpatient \nvariability (438) .\nPlease also refer to the chapter on dosing for more information.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 623RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS   \uf067\n48.

Polymyxin B and colistin (polymyxin E)\nIndication for use as a Reserve antibiotic\nTargeted treatment\nPolymyxin B or colistin could be considered, usually as part of a combination therapy, as \na last-resort option for the targeted treatment of severe infections caused by laboratory-\nconfirmed carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including infections caused \nby carbapenemase-producing strains that have been found to be susceptible to these \nantibiotics.\nIf available, polymyxin B is usually preferred to colistin because it has better \npharmacokinetic characteristics and less potential to cause kidney damage. \nThe only situation where the use of colistin is preferred is for the treatment of UTIs \nbecause colistin reaches higher concentrations in urine compared to polymyxin B. The \nprodrug colistimethate is excreted primarily by the kidneys, while polymyxin B is mainly \neliminated through non-renal pathways; however the fraction of colistimethate being \nconverted to colistin in the urine remains unclear (439) .\nEmpiric treatment\nPolymyxin B or colistin should only be considered for empiric use exceptionally in selected \ncases of seriously ill patients with invasive infections (e.g. patients with sepsis/septic shock) \nsuspected to be caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen (e.g. severe hospital-acquired \ninfections or infections in patients who have received multiple antibiotic treatments in the \nrecent past), such as in the following situations.\n\u2022 Patients who have not responded to carbapenems if other causes of treatment \nfailure have been excluded first and there is a strong suspicion that the infection \nis caused by a carbapenem-resistant pathogen. However, if a patient is not \nimproving, antibiotic failure is not the only possible cause to consider. Alternative \nreasons include for example: alternative diagnosis, development of complications \n(e.g. an abscess), inadequate source control, sub-optimal dose of the antibiotic or \nimpossibility for the antibiotic to reach an adequate concentration at the site of \ninfection. Alternative reasons are always important to consider before changing \nor adding new antibiotics.\n\u2022 Patients who have previously been treated for infections caused by carbapenem-\nresistant pathogens susceptible to polymyxins.\n\u2022 Patients who are known to be colonized with carbapenem-resistant pathogens \nfound to be susceptible to polymyxins.The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 625RESERVE ANTIBIOTICS   \uf067\n48. Polymyxin B and colistin (polymyxin E)\nTo help prescribers identify clinical scenarios where empiric use of Reserve antibiotics \ncould exceptionally be considered, suggestions are given in the relevant chapters of the \nAWaRe book for selected infections (only for infections where empiric use could potentially \nbe adequate on a case-by-case basis).\nEmerging resistance in Enterobacterales, \nPseudomonas aeruginosa  and Acinetobacter \nbaumannii\nSome technical challenges exist to identify resistance to polymyxin B and colistin. For \nexample, polymyxins diffuse poorly in diffusion-based assays, such as disk-diffusion tests. \nBroth microdilution, which is the recommended method, is impractical and rarely used \nin most laboratories (440) . Resistance can be related to chromosomal mutations that lead \nto changes in the bacterial membrane that impair the ability of polymyxin B and colistin \nto bind to their target. Plasmid-mediated resistance (i.e. transmissible resistance) due to \nmobilized colistin resistance (mcr) genes is also being increasingly described (441,442) .\nData on resistance to colistin and polymyxin B are currently not reported by the GLASS.\nDuration\nTreatment duration varies according to indication and should be as short as possible, usually \nbetween 7 and 14 days.626 The WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic bookDOSING GUIDANCEThe WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book 629DOSING GUIDANCE   \uf067\n49.
