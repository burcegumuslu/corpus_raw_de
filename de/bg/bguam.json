Almost all of the action takes place in a Dr. Zhivago type sleigh ride during a week-long blinding blizzard across the frozen Russian landscape.\nMinor spoilers follow.\nA doctor carrying vaccine has hired a sled driver to get him to a remote village where people have been struck by a plague. The harder the doctor tries to reach the village, the more obstacles he encounters. It's like one of those \u201crunning nightmares\u201d where you can never reach your destination. And, oh yes, I forgot to mention that the village people are suffering from the 'Bolivian plague' that turns them into zombies. Not good.\nThere\u2019s a shortage of gasoline. Fortunately, genetic bioengineering has done its magic and the sleigh\u2019s motor (think snowmobile) is powered by 50 miniature horses propelling a drive belt under the hood. Genetic manipulation has also bred giant and miniature humans. The giant people, 6 meters tall, are hired to do things like clear forests by ripping trees out by hand. A tavern owner they encounter on their journey is a miniature man, about as tall as a wine bottle, married to a normal-sized woman. We have digital clocks but no phones or internet.\nIn the travels of the doctor and his driver, they come across a tent city populated by Kazakh people, aka 'Vitaminders.' The Kazakhs erect their tents in a few minutes by using a substance squeezed out of a tube of toothpaste that they water and then in a few minutes it grows into a felt-like substance.\nThe Vitaminders make their living selling an LSD-type drug. The doctor takes advantage of the drug just as he did the tavern owner\u2019s wife. In his hallucinogenic drugged state the doctor has nightmarish dreams where he reflects on all the bad things he did in his life and tries to justify himself to a village tribunal that has condemned him to a gruesome death.\nI\u2019m not a science fiction fan but the book kept my attention with its inventiveness and my wondering exactly what is going on and what was coming next. On the other hand I didn\u2019t quite get the point of it all.\nSorokin (b. 1955) is a post-modern Russian writer.
