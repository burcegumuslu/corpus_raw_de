Consistent with the company's expectations, net interest income decreased during the quarter to $1.3 billion or 6.5 percent compared to the second quarter attributable to accelerating deposit and funding costs and a portion of the company's forward starting interest rate hedges becoming active, partially offset by the impact of higher market interest rates on asset yields. Total net interest margin decreased 31 basis points to 3.73 percent.\nNon-interest income decreased 2 percent on both a reported and adjusted basis(1) compared to the second quarter of 2023 primarily driven by decreases in service charges and capital markets income. Service charges income decreased 7 percent driven primarily by implementation of the no-cost Regions Overdraft Grace feature. The additional financial benefits and flexibility provided to Regions' customers from account features and enhancements over the past three years, has resulted in an approximate 45 percent reduction in both the number of occurrences and fees assessed. Capital markets income decreased 6 percent attributable primarily to lower real estate capital markets income offset partially by growth in merger and acquisitions advisory services. Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA, capital markets income decreased 13 percent. Mortgage income increased during the quarter primarily attributable to higher servicing income associated with a bulk purchase of the rights to service $6.2 billion of residential mortgage loans that closed early in the third quarter.\nNon-interest expense\nQuarter Ended\n($ amounts in millions)\n9/30/2023\n6/30/2023\n9/30/2022\n3Q23 vs. 2Q23\n3Q23 vs. 3Q22\nSalaries and employee benefits\n$\n589\n$\n603\n$\n593\n$\n(14\n)\n(2.3\n)%\n$\n(4\n)\n(0.7\n)%\nEquipment and software expense\n107\n101\n98\n6\n5.9\n%\n9\n9.2\n%\nNet occupancy expense\n72\n73\n76\n(1\n)\n(1.4\n)%\n(4\n)\n(5.3\n)%\nOutside services\n39\n42\n40\n(3\n)\n(7.1\n)%\n(1\n)\n(2.5\n)%\nProfessional, legal and regulatory expenses\n27\n20\n199\n7\n35.0\n%\n(172\n)\n(86.4\n)%\nMarketing\n26\n26\n29\n\u2014\n\u2014\n%\n(3\n)\n(10.3\n)%\nFDIC insurance assessments\n27\n29\n16\n(2\n)\n(6.9\n)%\n11\n68.8\n%\nCredit/checkcard expenses\n16\n15\n13\n1\n6.7\n%\n3\n23.1\n%\nOperational losses\n75\n95\n13\n(20\n)\n(21.1\n)%\n62\n476.9\n%\nBranch consolidation, property and equipment charges\n1\n1\n3\n\u2014\n\u2014\n%\n(2\n)\n(66.7\n)%\nVisa class B shares expense\n5\n9\n3\n(4\n)\n(44.4\n)%\n2\n66.7\n%\nOther\n109\n97\n87\n12\n12.4\n%\n22\n25.3\n%\nTotal non-interest expense\n$\n1,093\n$\n1,111\n$\n1,170\n$\n(18\n)\n(1.6\n)%\n$\n(77\n)\n(6.6\n)%\nTotal adjusted non-interest expense(1)\n$\n1,089\n$\n1,110\n$\n988\n$\n(21\n)\n(1.9\n)%\n$\n101\n10.2\n%\nNM - Not Meaningful\nNon-interest expense decreased 2 percent on both a reported and adjusted basis(1) compared to the second quarter of 2023.

Business services criticized loans increased 3 percent, while total delinquencies and non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans increased 15 basis points each. Total net charge-offs for the quarter were $101 million, or 40 basis points of average loans, due to elevated losses associated with a consumer point of sale program the company has previously discontinued, as well as lower commercial recoveries relative to the second quarter.\nThe increase to the allowance for credit losses compared to the second quarter was attributable primarily to adverse risk migration and continued credit quality normalization, as well as a build in model or qualitative adjustments for incremental risk in certain portfolios.\nThe allowance for credit loss ratio increased 5 basis points to 1.70 percent of total loans, while the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans decreased to 261 percent.\nCapital and liquidity\nAs of and for Quarter Ended\n9/30/2023\n6/30/2023\n9/30/2022\nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio(2)\n10.3%\n10.1%\n9.3%\nTier 1 capital ratio(2)\n11.6%\n11.4%\n10.6%\nTangible common stockholders\u2019 equity to tangible assets (non-GAAP)(1)\n5.82%\n6.09%\n5.01%\nTangible common book value per share (non-GAAP)(1)*\n$9.16\n$9.72\n$8.15\nLoans, net of unearned income, to total deposits\n78.4%\n78.1%\n70.0%\n*\nTangible common book value per share includes the impact of quarterly earnings and changes to market value adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income, as well as continued capital returns.\nRegions maintains a solid capital position with estimated capital ratios remaining well above current regulatory requirements.

The duration and severity of any pandemic could disrupt the global economy, adversely affect our capital and liquidity position, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and increase our allowance for credit losses, impair collateral values, and result in lost revenue or additional expenses.\nAny impairment of our goodwill or other intangibles, any repricing of assets, or any adjustment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets due to changes in tax law, adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations of the reporting unit or other factors.\nThe effect of new tax legislation and/or interpretation of existing tax law, which may impact our earnings, capital ratios, and our ability to return capital to shareholders.\nPossible changes in the creditworthiness of customers and the possible impairment of the collectability of loans and leases, including operating leases.\nChanges in the speed of loan prepayments, loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs, credit loss provisions or actual credit losses where our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses.\nPossible acceleration of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities due to declining interest rates, and the related acceleration of premium amortization on those securities.\nLoss of customer checking and savings account deposits as customers pursue other, higher-yield investments, which could increase our funding costs.\nPossible changes in consumer and business spending and saving habits and the related effect on our ability to

a timely manner could have a negative impact on our revenue.\nOur inability to keep pace with technological changes, including those related to the offering of digital banking and financial services, could result in losing business to competitors.\nChanges in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, including legislation and regulations relating to bank products and services, such as special

including as a result of the changes in U.S. presidential administration, control of the U.S. Congress, and changes in personnel at the bank regulatory agencies, which could require us to change certain business practices, increase compliance risk, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses.\nOur capital actions, including dividend payments, common stock repurchases, or redemptions of preferred stock, must not cause us to fall below minimum capital ratio requirements, with applicable buffers taken into account, and must comply with other requirements and restrictions under law or imposed by our regulators, which may impact our ability to return capital to shareholders.\nOur ability to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements (as part of the CCAR process or otherwise) may continue to require a significant investment of our managerial resources due to the importance of such tests and requirements.\nOur

For discussion of these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, look under the captions \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" in Regions\u2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and in Regions\u2019 subsequent filings with the SEC.\nYou should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all of them. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements that are made from time to time, either as a result of future developments, new information or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nUse of non-GAAP financial measures\nManagement uses pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP) and adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP), as well as the adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) and the adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP) to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) and adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP) are used to determine adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP). Net interest income (GAAP) on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the adjusted fee income and adjusted efficiency ratios. Net loan charge-offs (GAAP) are presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted net loan-charge offs (non-GAAP). Adjusted net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans (non-GAAP) are calculated as adjusted net loan charge-offs (non-GAAP) divided by average loans (GAAP) and annualized. Regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful basis for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions\u2019 business. It is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur; however, management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.\nTangible common stockholders\u2019 equity ratios have become a focus of some investors and management believes they may assist investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions\u2019 capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders\u2019 equity measure. Because tangible common stockholders\u2019 equity is not formally defined by GAAP or prescribed in any amount by federal banking regulations it is currently considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than Regions\u2019 disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions\u2019 capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders\u2019 equity, management believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions\u2019 capital adequacy on this same basis.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders.\nManagement and the Board of Directors utilize non-GAAP measures as follows:\nPreparation of Regions' operating budgets\nMonthly financial performance reporting\nMonthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only)\nPresentation to investors of company performance\nMetrics for incentive compensation\nRegions\u2019 Investor Relations contact is Dana Nolan at (205) 264-7040; Regions\u2019 Media contact is Jeremy King at (205)
