The LOB itself is a graphic device that enables a manager to see at a single glance which activities of an operation are in balance - i.e., whether those which should have been completed at the time of the review actually are completed and whether any activities scheduled for future completion are lagging behind schedule. CPM is continuously used in India for network analysis and finding critical path, Problem is taken as challenge to introduce and the new technique named linear scheduling which is proved better than CPM for repetitive construction works.\nAutorenportrait\nDr. Amit Sharma Ph.D in Structural Engineering from SGSITS Indore.Working in Civil Engineering Department, Institute of Engineering Science,Indore.
