To evaluate energy balance during these two periods, seventy-eight children (45% females, 8\u201310 years) living in Parma, Italy, were enrolled in this observational study. Participants completed a 3-day food diary and wore an activity tracker for three consecutive days during a school- and a summer camp-week to estimate energy intake (EI) and energy expenditure (TEE). Height and body weight were measured at the beginning of each period to define children\u2019s weight status. BMI and EI (school: 1692 \u00b1 265 kcal/day; summer camp: 1738 \u00b1 262 kcal/day) were similar during both periods. Both physical activity and TEE (summer camp: 1948 \u00b1 312; school: 1704 \u00b1 263 kcal/day) were higher during summer camp compared to school time. Therefore, energy balance was more negative during summer camp (\u2212209 \u00b1 366 kcal/day) compared to school time (\u221212 \u00b1 331 kcal/day). Similar results were observed when males and females were analyzed separately but, comparing the sexes, males had a higher TEE and a more negative energy balance than females, during both periods. The results strongly suggest that an accurate evaluation of children\u2019s energy balance, that considers both diet and physical activity, is needed when planning adequate diets for different situations.\n- Andere Ausgabe\n- Link zur Erstver\u00f6ffentlichung\nLink:\n[https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13010092](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13010092)\n- Freie Schlagw\u00f6rter (EN)\n- energy balance; energy intake; energy expenditure; primary school; summer camp; physical activity; BMI; food record; activity tracker; children\n- Klassifikation (DDC)\n- 610\n- Verlag\n- MDPI, Basel\n- Version / Begutachtungsstatus\n- publizierte Version / Verlagsversion\n- URN Qucosa\n[urn:nbn:de:bsz:15-qucosa2-848569](https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:15-qucosa2-848569)\n- Ver\u00f6ffentlichungsdatum Qucosa\n- 21.04.2023\n- Dokumenttyp\n- Artikel\n- Sprache des Dokumentes\n- Englisch\n- Lizenz / Rechtehinweis\n[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": [null, "/", "/", "/landing-page/#skip2content", "/landing-page/#skip2nav", "/impressum/", null, "https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:15-qucosa2-848569", "https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13010092", "https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:15-qucosa2-848569", "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "https://ul.qucosa.de/api/qucosa%3A84856/attachment/ATT-0/", "/nutzungshinweise-fuer-die-digitalen-objekte-in-qucosa/#c154", "/landing-page/", "/landing-page/", null, null, "/", "/ueber-den-publikationsserver/", "/ueber-qucosa/", "/veroeffentlichen/", "/recherche/", "/faq/", "/impressum/", "/datenschutzerklaerung/", "https://www.qucosa.de/typo3/", "http://www.dini.de/"]}
