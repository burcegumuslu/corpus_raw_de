Thus, it was thought that \ndifferentiation along a given lineage was associated with \nprogressive loss of potential to give rise to other blood cell lineages. However, the recent developments of very sensitive and quantitative in vitro assays, together with the identification of new progenitor subpopulations have challenged these ideas.  Thus, lymphocyte progenitors can be shown to keep their developmental potential to give rise to myeloid, dendritic and NK cells until just prior to their final commitment stage. Here, we will summarize our contributions to these new concepts and will discuss the potential use of these early progenitors in therapy.\nThe developmental plasticity of Pax-5 deficient pro-B cells\nMice in which expression of the transcription factor Pax-5 had been prevented have an absolute block in B cell development at the early pro-B cell stage. The pro B cells present in the bone marrow of Pax5\n-/- mice express \nboth RAG-1 and RAG-2 required for immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangements, have their Ig heavy chain loci D-J rearranged and express transcripts for the B cell specific genes \u03bb5, VpreB, Ig \u03b1 and  Ig\u03b2.  Moreover, like wild-type \npro-B cells, Pax5\n-/- pro B cells can be grown in vitro  on stro -\nmal cells in the presence of IL-7 for long periods of time. However, and in marked contrast to wild type cells, Pax5\n-/- \nprogenitor B cells can still develop both in vitro  and in vivo  \ninto cells of other hematopoietic lineages, namely my -\neloid, NK, and T cells (1\u20133); they thus possess multi-lin -\neage developmental potential. Very recently, Busslinger and colleagues (4) have shown that even mature B cells can regain this multi-lineage developmental potential upon conditional inactivation of the Pax5\n-/- gene. These \nfindings indicate that hematopoietic differentiation has much more plasticity than previously anticipated i.e. that progenitor cells on their way to differentiate into a given lineage keep the potential to give rise to other cell types until a rather advanced stage of differentiation.\nEarly stages of lymphoid development in mouse \nbone marrow\nAs mentioned above, pro B cells found in the bone mar -\nrow of Pax5\n-/- mice show a remarkable degree of de -The research of the \u201cDevelopmental and Molecular Immunology\u201d group is sponsored by an en-\ndowment from F.

However, until recently it was \nunclear whether this type of cell was unique to the  Pax5-/-  \nmouse or whether they were also present in wild type \nmice. Our laboratory has analyzed in great detail wheth -\ner a cell equivalent to the Pax5-/- pro B cell is present in \nwild type bone marrow. Pax5-/- pro B cells express B220 \nand c-kit (CD117) and are negative for CD19 and NK1.1. In fact, expression of CD19 is under direct transcriptional control of Pax5  and can therefore be used as a surrogate \nmarker for Pax5  expression (5). In the bone marrow of \nwild type mice, about 0.2% of the nucleated cells have such a phenotype. Moreover, like Pax5\n-/- pro B cells, these \ncells express the IL-7R \u03b1 (CD127), Flt3 (CD135) and CD93 \n(6). In vitro  analysis, using established culture systems to \ntest B, T and myeloid developmental potential revealed that these cells from wild type bone marrow could very efficiently differentiate into all three (myeloid, NK, and T cell) lineages (6). These findings suggested that the multi-lineage developmental potential of these cells was similar to that of the Pax5\n-/- pro B cells. In fact, their plasticity was \neven greater in that they could still switch on the Pax5  \ngene and very efficiently give rise to B lineage cells. Based on the fact that these cells from wild type mice can dif -\nferentiate into B, T, NK and myeloid cells, we have called them \u201cearly progenitors with lymphoid and myeloid de -\nvelopmental potential\u201d, or EPLM.EPLM in wild type bone marrow comprise about 0.2% \nof all nucleated cells and expressed CD135, the receptor for Flt3 ligand (Flt3L). Daily treatment of mice with 5\u201310  \u03bcg \nFLT3L for 7-10 days increased EPLM number fifty fold (7). In vitro  analysis also revealed that EPLM from Flt3L -treated \nmice possessed very efficient myeloid and T cell develop -\nmental potential. However, their ability to generate B cells was dramatically reduced, thereby accounting for the de -\ncreased precursor B cell compartment in the bone marrow of Flt3L-treated mice. Thus, the number of EPLM in the bone marrow seems to be controlled by Flt3L and high lev -\nels of this seem to impair their B developmental potential.\nEPLM in vitro  can generate B, T, NK and myeloid cells. \nIn vivo  transplantation studies, however, showed that \nlow numbers (2\u20135 x103) of EPLM could only give rise to B \ncells while higher numbers (2 x 104) were able to gener -\nate T and B cells (6). No myeloid development of EPLM in vivo  has thus far been observed. Based on these find -\nings, we strongly favour the idea that under physiological conditions, the developmental fate of EPLM is mainly to become B cells. Since, in our hands, CLPs have a very simi -\nlar developmental potential to EPLMs, these cells should  probably also be regarded as very early B cell progenitors (6). In figure 1 the various differentiation pathways of EPLM and the cytokines and signaling molecules involved in their development are summarized. \nFront row from left to right: \nClaudia Suenderhauf, Marianne  Spalinger, Roxane Tussiwand, Ang\u00e8le \nB\u00e9nard, Antonius Rolink,  \nReto Ziegler, Giuseppina Capoferri\nBack row from left to right: \nNicole Salvisberg, Rhodri  Ceredig, Nabil Bosco, Jan Andersson, Johanna RolinkDBM Facts 2|2008 Departement Biomedizin4 WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE DEPARTEMENT BIOMEDIZIN, MATTENSTRASSE 28\nEarly stages of T cell development in the thymus\nEarly stages of T cell development in the thymus are cha -\nracterized by the differential expression of the markers CD44 and CD25 and the absence of CD4, 8 and 3. Because they express neither CD4 nor CD8, these cells are usually called double negative (DN) thymocytes. DN thymocytes can be subdivided into four populations called DN1\u20134. DN1s are CD44\n+CD25-, DN2s are CD44+CD25+, DN3s are \nCD44-CD25+ and DN4s are CD44-CD25-. However B, NK, \nmyeloid and dendritic cells are also present in the thy -\nmus and most of them would have a DN1-like phenotype. Therefore, the inclusion of c-kit (CD117) as a marker to de -\nfine bona fide DN1 cells is absolutely crucial. Like DN2 cells \nDN1 express high levels of c-kit while DN3 cells express intermediate levels and DN4 cells are negative (8).\nBecause the thymus does not harbour HSC, a con -\nstant influx of progenitor cells from the bone marrow into the thymus is required in order to maintain continuous T cell production.  Over the last couple of years, a whole se -\nries of papers have been published dealing with the phe -\nnotype and developmental potential of the bone marrow progenitor cell that enters the thymus (9\u201316).  Studies by Radtke and colleagues (14) unambiguously demonstrated that signaling via the Notch-1 receptor was an absolutely crucial event in early T cell commitment and develop -\nment. Thus, these authors showed that in Notch-1-de -\nficient mice, the earliest thymocyte subpopulation was absent and that the thymus contained precursors with B cell developmental potential. Based on these findings, it was concluded that the thymus was normally seeded by \na bone marrow precursor that still possessed B cell devel -\nopmental potential and which would loose this potential \nupon Notch signaling. However, several groups, including our own, had been unable to find progenitor cells with B developmental potential in the adult thymus (12,13,17). It should also be noted, however, that other groups have found low frequencies of cells able to give rise to B cells in the thymus (10,11,15,18). Recently Sambandam and col -\nleagues (15) showed that a small fraction of DN1 cells also expresses CD135 (Flt3) and that it is this subpopulation that contained B lineage potential. This subpopulation was called thymus-settling cells (TSP). Moreover, these cells also seem to express the chemokine receptor CCR9, which might be the receptor that guides progenitor cell homing to the thymus (12).\nWe have recently been able to confirm this finding. In \nour hands, CD135 is expressed by about 20% of DN1 cells and it has been proposed that CD135-positive DN1 cells are the precursors of the CD135-negative subpopulation. Therefore, in our schemes of thymocyte development (see figure 2) we subdivide DN1 cells into CD135\n+ DN1.1 \nand CD135- DN1.2 cells. Limiting dilution analysis revealed \nthat 1 in 1000 CD135+ DN1.1 cells from adult mice were \nable to generate B lineage cells (19). Thus the TSP , as \nReferences:\n1  Nutt, S.

DN1 and 2 cells are not committed to the T cell lineage since they can still efficiently give rise to NK and myeloid cells (17). For the progression in T cell development, DN3 cells require Notch but not IL-7 and c-kit signaling. Even though growth of DN3 cells is still dependent on continued Notch signaling, this signaling is no longer capable of maintaining their c-kit expression. This probably means that Notch downstream signaling is altered at this important transition from DN2 to DN3 cells, a transition that also involves complete T cell \ncommitment. In figure 2, the phenotype, developmental \npotential and the requirements for differentiation of the early stages of thymocyte development is summarized.\nConcluding remarksThe recent development of very sensitive and quantita -\ntive in vitro  assays, together with the identification of new \nprogenitor subpopulations has unambiguously shown that hematopoietic development is far less hierarchic \nthen previously thought. Thus, lymphocyte progenitors \ncan be shown to keep their developmental potential to \ngive rise to myeloid, dendritic and NK cells until just prior \nto their final commitment stage. However, the in vivo  rel-\nevance of this plasticity is to a large part still unclear. \nFinally the findings that mouse progenitor B and T \ncells propagated and expanded in vitro  can upon in vivo  \ntransfer generate a functional adaptive immune system might offer new therapeutic strategies for patients with defects in their T and/or B cell compartments.\nAntonius Rolink\nDevelopmental and Molecular Immunology\nFigure 2.

In \nnumerical terms, this means that the adult thymus only harbours about 5 cells with B cell developmental poten -\ntial. In marked contrast, about 1 in 10 CD135\n+ DN1.1 cells \nfrom newborn mice could generate B lineage cells, indi -\ncating that the thymus at this age has about 300 of these precursors (19). Thus the thymus might indeed be colo -\nnized by rare precursors that have T and B as well as NK and myeloid (see below) developmental potential. Using thymus grafting experiments, Jotereau and colleagues (20,21) had previously shown that the newborn mouse thymus was colonized by a wave of precursor cells. Our finding that these multi lineage cells are much more abundant in the newborn mouse supports this idea.\nRecently, we have shown that DN1 and 2 thymocytes \nrequire Notch, IL-7 and c-kit signaling for their continued T l i ne a g e d i ff e r e n ti a ti on ( 2 2 , 2 3 ) .

In terms of DNA, this amounts to about 6 billion nucleotide pairs that would make a linear molecule of 2 meters length. By the time we are grown up, trillions of descendants of this original stem cell constitute the physical and functional makeup of our bodies, and essentially all of them carry a copy of the ge -\nnome. The DNA of all these cells would now stretch over a length of 300 times the distance between earth and sun \u2013 and back! Needless to say that the magnitude of this is breath-taking, and if we consider that this lot of DNA must be synthesized and maintained in an essentially error free manner, we must appreciate that the underlying molecu -\nlar mechanisms must be of the most sophisticated and fascinating developments of nature.\nThe faithful transmission of genetic information from \nmother to daughter cells depends on the accurate du -\nBack row from left to right: \nStefan Weis, Olivier Fritsch, \nChristophe Kunz, Yusuke  Saito, \nDavid Sch\u00fcrmann\nFront row from left to right: \nPatric Urfer, Claudia Krawczyk, \nBarbara Gruberski,  Primo Sch\u00e4r, \nDaniel Cortazar, Frauke Focke6 WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE DEPARTEMENT BIOMEDIZIN, MATTENSTRASSE 28DBM Facts 2|2008 Department of Biomedicineplication of the genomic DNA. Given the chemical reac -\ntivity of the aqueous and aerobic environment of a cell \nnucleus, however, the maintenance of a structurally and chemically integer DNA template for error-free replication represents a major challenge. It is therefore not surprising that cells dedicate appreciable resources to the surveil -\nlance and repair of their DNA. It is their capacity to cor -\nrect damaged DNA that balances the inherent instability of our genomes, which, when elevated, is associated with premature ageing or the premature onset of age-related disease such as cancer.\nThe foci of our research are biological processes that \nenforce genome stability at the level of DNA damage re -\nsponse and repair. Our objective is to provide a thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the repair of DNA base damage and broken DNA back -\nbones, and the consequences of their dysfunction for cancer development and therapy. I will focus my account on one line of investigation to illustrate how we apply bio -\nchemistry to approach basic mechanisms of DNA repair and genetics to explore biological functions.\nDNA Base Excision Repair: Insights from Studies with an \nUnusual DNA GlycosylaseDNA base lesions arise thousands of times every day in every single cell of our body, and occasionally they give rise to genetic mutations. Changes from C to T are fre -\nquent base substitutions in the human genome. They arise mostly through spontaneous or enzymatic deami -\nnation of 5-metyhylcytosine (5-mC) or cytosine in DNA, which generates thymine and uracil bases impaired with guanine, respectively. If mutation is to be avoided, these \nG\u2022T and G\u2022U mispairs must be corrected to G\u2022C, and this \nis accomplished by a process called base excision repair (BER). BER is triggered by the action of a damage-specific DNA glycosylase that excises the irregular base from the DNA backbone, generating an abasic site (AP-site) that is further processed by an endonuclease, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase to restore the original undamaged se -\nquence. Human TDG is one of the BER initiating DNA glycosylases; it excises mismatched thymine and uracil from DNA as well as a number of additional base deriva -\ntives, including 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), a chemotherapeutic base-analogue. However, TDG has attracted our attention because of some atypical biochemical and molecular fea -tures, including its physical and functional interactions with transcription factors and de novo  DNA methyltrans -\nferases. Such peculiarities suggested that TDG might excise DNA bases in contexts other than classical DNA repair. Hence, we pursued various genetic and biochemi -\ncal approaches to understand the protein and its func -\ntion better. These efforts have uncovered entirely novel functional and mechanistic aspects of BER, such as a role SUMO-modification in DNA repair, a contribution of TDG dependent base excision to the DNA-directed cytotoxic -\nity of 5-FU, and a possible association of TDG dependent \nprocesses with epigenetic events involved in stem cell \nmaintenance and cell-fate determination.\nSUMOs Make Their Way Into DNA Repair\nWe are not talking Japanese wrestlers here, SUMO stands for \nsmall ubiquitin-like proteins that modify other proteins \nthrough covalent linkage to specific lysine residues. First indications for an involvement of such modifiers in DNA repair came from protein interaction studies in our labora -\ntory; Roland Steinacher identified SUMOs as binding part -\nners of the human TDG in yeast two-hybrid screens, and Ulrike Hardeland then showed that TDG is a specific target for covalent SUMO modification. Importantly, Ulrike also found that SUMO-conjugation significantly reduces the AP-site binding affinity of TDG, allowing the glycosylase to dissociate from the product following base release. This \nprovided an answer to a long-standing question, namely \nhow the endonuclease acting downstream in the repair process will gain access to the AP-site in the presence of a DNA glycosylase that binds to such intermediates with high affinity. Roland then went on to structure-function studies to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this SUMO-induced affinity change. He was able to demonstrate that unmodified TDG undergoes a conformational change upon binding to DNA, assuming a clamp-like structure that engages into a tight mode of DNA interaction upon encountering and processing a G-mismatched substrate. By showing that SUMO-modifica -\ntion induced opening of this DNA binding clamp, he was able to establish a novel, SUMO-based mechanism for the coordinated hand-over of DNA repair intermediates be -\ntween upstream and downstream acting enzymes in DNA repair (Figure 1).DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICINE, MATTENSTRASSE 28 WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE 7DBM Facts 2|2008 Departement BiomedizinRoland then started to investigate whether SUMO-\nmodification might be a more general mechanistic feature \nof BER. Following the reconstitution of a SUMO conjugation system with purified human proteins, he and David Sch\u00fcr -\nmann explored the modification of other BER proteins in \nvitro . This identified at least two more BER proteins as pos -\nsible SUMO targets, among those XRCC1, a central compo -\nnent of the system with matchmaker function. Subsequent experiments addressing the role of TDG and XRCC1 modifi -\ncations in the repair process then lead to an interesting dis -\ncovery. The key observation was that SUMO modification to \nTDG was stimulated by the addition of DNA if performed in \na nuclear extract, but inhibited in a reconstituted system, consisting of purified TDG and SUMO modification factors only. This suggested that a specificity factor, presumably a SUMO-E3 ligase type of activity, was missing in the puri -\nfied system. Roland and David reasoned that specific BER proteins or complexes might provide such a function and reconstituted the BER system by adding the purified com -\nponents to the SUMOylation reaction. This had little effect on TDG modification in the presence of DNA, unless they added SUMO in an XRCC1-conjugated form (instead of free SUMO1). This yielded an efficient and directed transfer of the SUMO moiety from XRCC1 to TDG, a process that was in agreement with protein interaction data showing that only SUMO1-conjugated but not free XRCC1 is capable of inter -\nacting with TDG. These findings indicate that SUMO modi -\nfication might coordinate the BER process (and possibly other DNA transactions) by orchestrating the sequential recruitment, assembly and reconfiguration of multi-pro -\ntein complexes as the repair reaction proceeds.TDG and Cellular Responses to 5-FU\nTo explore the biological function of TDG, we generated null-mutants in yeast and mouse and analyzed the pheno -\ntype of TDG loss in both models. In the course of his work with yeast, Marc Bentele discovered that TDG is responsible for much of the DNA directed cytotoxicity of the therapeu -\ntic anti-cancer drug 5-FU. Moreover, he observed that 5-FU induces significant genomic instability in yeast and that this also depends to a large extent on active TDG. Since the DNA-directed effect of 5-FU is likely a consequence of in -\ncreased misincorporation dUMP and 5-F-dUMP into DNA, we concluded from these results that the processing of \nuracil and 5-FU by TDG is cytotoxic and mutagenic.\nGuided by the yeast studies, Christophe Kunz started \nto address the phenotype of TDG deficient mouse cells \n(ES cells and MEFs) that Yusuke Saito and himself gener -\nated in the context of a knock-out project. As predicted by the yeast phenotype, mouse cells lacking TDG showed a marked hyperresistance to treatment with 5-FU (Figure 2). This phenotype correlated with the level of Tdg activity in cells, implicating a rate-limiting role of TDG in the conver -\nsion 5-FU-induced DNA lesions into toxic intermediates. Further investigation confirmed this hypothesis and shed light onto the underlying molecular details. Christophe could show that upon 5-FU exposure, fluorouracil nucleo -\ntides get incorporated into genomic DNA with steady-state levels being significantly elevated in TDG deficient cells. Together with Frauke Focke he could further show that the excision of these bases by TDG generates DNA strand-breaks, activates DNA repair processes, and triggers DNA damage signaling in S-phase. These results provided novel \nFigure 1: Base excision by TDG involves dynamic DNA interactions. Expe -\nrimental evidence suggests that upon contacting DNA, the N-terminus \nof TDG forms a DNA binding clamp, which allows the glycosylase to slide \nalong the duplex in search for a potential substrate. Upon encountering \na substrate, the catalytic domain of TDG rotates  the base (U) out of the helix and engages into specific interactions with the DNA strand oppo -\nsite. Following base release, SUMOylation of TDG opens the clamp struc -\nture, facilitating its dissociation from the AP-site. APE1 gains access and carries on with the BER process. 8 WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE DEPARTEMENT BIOMEDIZIN, MATTENSTRASSE 28DBM Facts 2|2008 Department of Biomedicineand important insight into the molecular events underly -\ning the DNA-directed cytotoxicity of 5-FU. Of more gen -\neral significance, this work implicated that although TDG \nmay contribute to the repair of base lesions, it does so in an inefficient way that gives rise to mutagenic and cyto -\ntoxic DNA intermediates, a property that may related to its strong interaction with the AP-site following base release (Figure 1). Apparently, TDG dependent BER is not designed to deal with frequently occurring DNA base lesions and ful -\nfills a specialized rather than a general repair function.\nTowards Understanding the Specialized Function of TDGAttempts by Teresa Lettieri and Yusuke Saito to generate a TDG knockout mouse were exhausting, initially only be -\ncause the locus was very hard to target by homologous recombination and then because the glycosylase quite unexpectedly turned out to be essential for embryogen -\nesis. Since all other DNA glycosylase knockouts generated previously did not show any developmental defects, this phenotype corroborated our view that is a special case among this DNA glycosylases with function that may be different from the simple repair of base damage. To fa -\ncilitate further functional studies, Yusuke and Christophe established a series of TDG deficient ES cells and MEFs. They performed transcriptome analyses of ES cells under -\ngoing in vitro differentiation and found evidence for an involvement of TDG in the establishment of cell-lineage specific gene expression. Considering its interactions with transcription factors and DNMT3a and DNMT3b and its enzymatic properties, we speculated that TDG might act in concert with DNA methyltransferases to protect certain CpG sites from erroneous de novo methylation during cell \ndifferentiation. In a series of in vitro differentiation experi -\nments with TDG proficient and deficient ES cells, Yusuke \nindeed observed differences in the dynamics of de novo \nmethylation in promoters of pluripotency genes (e.g. Oct4) that undergo epigenetic silencing during ES cell dif -\nferentiation. His data are in support of a scenario, whereby TDG is targeted to these promoters through its interaction with transcription factors or DNA methyltransferases in order to initiate excision repair of erroneously methylated cytosines. Consistently, Daniel Cortazar\u2019s recent efforts to chromatin-immunoprecipitate TDG (TDG-ChIP) yielded physical evidence for an enrichment of the glycosylase at the promoters of Oct4 and other genes.\nThese are exciting developments, implicating a role \nfor DNA repair not only in genome but also in epigenome maintenance. Sure, there is still some way to go before we will be able to come up with a conclusive scenario for such a function, but it looks like studying TDG dependent BER guides us in a promising direction. One obstacle along this way seems to be phenotypic instability of TDG deficient ES cells. If this is a reflection of an inherent promiscuous epigenetic behaviour of these cells, we seem to be on the right track though.\nAnd There is More of Us \u2013 Next TimeI must apologize to Olivier Fritsch, Claudia Krawczyk,  Patric Urfer and Stefan Weis for not having included their \nprojects on DNA double-strand break repair and cancer epigenetics in this account.

Amongst the elderly population (>75 yrs), the prevalence of heart failure is even higher (up to 10%). Recent advances in treatment of cardiac diseases, in par -\nticular myocardial infarction, have improved survival with -\nout, however, restoring the full contractile competence of the heart. Thus, both aging of the population and modern -\ntime treatment of heart disease will further increase the prevalence of heart failure. In Switzerland, roughly 100 000 \npeople are affected and 20 000 new cases are added each \nyear. Although heart failure treatment has likewise mar -\nkedly improved over the past decades \u2013 mainly due to the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi -\ntors, \u03b2-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists \u2013 prognosis \nis still poor. The one-year survival rate for advanced stage heart failure is even worse than those for most malignant cancers. Because of the high frequency of hospitaliza -\ntions, the costs for treatment of heart failure are high and amount to an estimated 1 (US)-billion CHF per year.\nMyocardial remodeling is a pivotal process in the \ndevelopment of heart failure \nMyocardial injury of any kind [e.g. mechanical (arterial hy -\npertension), hypoxic (myocardial infarction), toxic (alco -\nhol), infectious (myocarditis), metabolic (diabetes) etc.] \ninitiates a process that is referred to as myocardial remo -deling and that plays a key role in the development of heart failure. Myocardial remodeling encompasses progressive changes in myocardial structure and function that may be protective or adaptive at the beginning (compensatory hy -\npertrophy), but turn deleterious or maladaptive as disease progresses (ventricular dilation and dysfunction), finally leading to heart failure (Fig 1). At the level of the cardiomy -\nocytes, these changes include myocyte growth (hypertro -\nphy) loss of myocytes (apoptosis or necrosis), alterations in myocyte architecture and reexpression of fetal iso -\nforms (e.g. \u03b2-myosin heavy chain) that affect contractile \nfunction and/or calcium homeostasis. Myocardial remo -\ndeling is triggered and promoted by so-called remodeling stimuli. These include cytokines and neurohormones that are released in the setting of myocardial injury.\nPerturbation of the cellular redox-homeostasis can \nlead to oxidative stressReactive oxygen species (ROS) are highly reactive oxygen moieties that arise from incomplete reduction of molecu -\nlar oxygen (O\n2) either by a leak of electrons from the re -\nspiratory chain in the mitochondria or through the action of intracellular oxidase enzymes such as NADPH oxidase. A number of enzymatic antioxidants are in charge of re -\nmoving excessive ROS and of maintaining a physiologi -\ncal redox-balance (Fig. 2). Myocardial remodeling stimuli can directly enhance ROS production by activating ROS-gene  rating enzymes and/or decreasing the antioxidant \ndefense capacities, which results in a net increase of ROS \n(oxidative stress) . Via oxidation of DNA, lipids and proteins, \nFigure 1\n Figure 2DBM Facts 2|2008 Departement Biomedizin12 WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE DEPARTEMENT BIOMEDIZIN USB\nexcessive ROS may directly induce cellular injury that leads \nto cell death, disease and premature aging. However, ROS can also participate in cell signaling through activation of redox-sensitive signaling cascades and thus initiate both protective (adaptive) or damaging (maladaptive) cellular events. \nThe oxidative stress hypothesis of heart failure\nMarkers of oxidative stress (e.g. lipid peroxidation pro -\nducts such as isoprostanes) are elevated systemically in the myocardium of humans and in animal models of heart \nfailure. However, recent evidence suggests that ROS are \nnot just mere by-products of heart failure. The oxidative \nstress hypothesis  o f  h e a r t  f a i l u r e  p o s t u l a t e s  t h a t  R O S  a c -\ntively contribute to myocardial remodeling. Consistent with this hypothesis, antioxidant treatment can ameliorate \nadverse remodeling in vitro  and in animal models in vivo . \nConversely, the administration of ROS can mimic typical \nfeatures observed in myocardial remodeling in vitro : treat -\nment of rat cardiomyocytes with hydrogen peroxide leads to differential, concentration-dependent activation of spe -\ncific kinase signaling pathways resulting in hypertrophy in response to low and apoptosis to high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Accordingly, ROS have been implicat -\ned as mediators of hypertrophic and apoptotic signaling in response to various remodeling stimuli, such as mechani -\ncal strain, \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimulation, TNF \u03b1, \nangiotensin  and endothelin. Still, the mechanisms where -\nby ROS exert their effects remain poorly understood. \nAccording to the redox-homeostasis model depicted \nin Fig. 2, the following therapeutic strategies  to protect the \nheart from oxidative stress can be delineated: (1) Scaveng -\ning or neutralizing ROS by enhancing antioxidant capacities , \n(2) Inhibiting sources  of ROS or (3) Protecting potential ROS \ntargets  from oxidation.\nClinical antioxidant trials and reasons for their failure Despite overwhelming evidence from in vitro  and in vivo  ani-\nmal studies in support of the oxidative stress hypothesis of heart failure, several clinical trials using (mostly nutritional) antioxidants in humans have yielded disappointing results. Neither vitamin C, nor vitamin E or \u03b2-carotene has proven \nuseful in the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular disease. Notably, vitamin E in fact increased  the incidence of heart failure events in a large study population at aug -\nmented risk of cardiovascular disease (HOPE trial). These findings cast major doubt on the use of antioxidants as a suitable strategy for the treatment of human heart failure. Inappropriate end-points, antioxidative effects of adjuvant therapies, issues in patient selection and inappropriate an -\ntioxidants may \u2013 at least to a certain degree \u2013 explain why antioxidants were ineffective in these trials. Other reasons, however, may relate to the fact that under certain circum -\nstances, ROS-signaling may be protective rather than de -\nleterious, or to the most recent intriguing hypothesis that \u201creductive stress \u201d (i.e. an abnormal increase of reducing \nequivalents such as reduced glutathione and NADPH) itself may cause a distinct form of cardiomyopathy. \nProtective ROS-signaling and the counter-hypo  thesis: \nwhen reductive stress causes cardiomyopathy\nThe effect of ROS on cell number (by affecting cell survival \nor proliferation), morphology (growth/hypertrophy) and function (contractility) relates to the oxidative \u201cburden\u201d. For example, a low oxidative burden induced by low levels of ROS or by ROS of low reactivity will initiate rather regu -\nlatory or protective processes, whereas a high oxidative burden (high levels or highly reactive species) will induce cellular injury. Besides the reactivity of the species, their sources , the cell type (cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells \nor fibroblasts) and subcellular localization, as well as the respective targets influence the net response to ROS. Simi -\nlarly, type and stage of the disease may play a role. \nVery recently, reductive stress  due to an unbalanced \nincrease in activity of endogenous antioxidants has been shown to induce a distinct form of cardiomyopathy in a mouse model of a human multisystem protein aggrega -\ntion disease. These animals exhibit increased recycling of oxidized to reduced glutathione that causes protein ag -\ngregation and hypertrophy, finally leading to heart failure and premature death. These findings published in Cell last \nyear will change the paradigm of ROS as purely detrimental contributors to myocardial remodeling and highlight the need of a more comprehensive understanding of the role of ROS and their potential targets in the heart. \nUnderstanding the mechanisms of ROS interactions \nIn our lab, we seek to understand the role of myocardial \nROS from distinct sources and their mechanisms of inter -DBM Facts 2|2008 Department of BiomedicineDEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICINE USB WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE 13\nThe future: targeting the source rather than ROS\nIn view of the disappointing clinical trials using antioxidants for treatment of cardiovascular disease and heart failure in humans, inhibition of the respective sources of ROS seems a promising alternative strategy. Recently, small molecule and peptide inhibitors of NADPH oxidase have been de -\nveloped and tested in various models of cardiovascular disease in vitro  and in vivo . However, an increasing body \nof evidence suggests that NADPH oxidase-derived ROS may have distinct effects depending on the isoform, the di sease state and the cell type. NADPH oxidase may thus \nbe crucial to both cardiovascular health and disease. Our \nown preliminary data suggest that NADPH oxidase-derived ROS participate in the regulation of adaptive  remodeling in \ncardiomyocytes via regulation of \u03b2\n1-integrin. We hope that \nour studies will contribute to a more comprehensive un -\nderstanding of the roles of ROS in myocardial remodeling, in order that better targeted strategies can be developed in the future to prevent and treat heart failure. \nGabriela M. Kusteraction with respective target molecules. ROS can induce oxidative modifications of proteins and thus alter their structure and/or function. In the laboratory of Dr. W.S. Co -\nlucci at Boston University, where I have previously worked, we found oxidatively modified (nitrotyrosinylated) pro -\ntein in mice hearts after ascending aortic constriction, a condition associated with increased oxidative/nitrosative stress. Further work suggested that post-translational oxi -\ndative modification of free reactive thiols on the small G-protein Ras increases Ras activity and thus promotes ROS-dependent hypertrophic signaling in cardiomyocytes. We \nare currently focusing our work on \u03b2\n1-integrin as a poten -\ntial target of ROS. Integrins are transmembrane receptors \nthat participate in the regulation of cell growth, prolifera -\ntion and death. In cardiomyocytes, \u03b21-integrin mediates \nhypertrophy and protects the cells from apoptosis. In our current project we test whether ROS participate in the con -\ntrol of \u03b2\n1-integrin activity by regulating the amount (tran -\nscriptional regulation) and/or avidity of \u03b21-integrin (post-\ntranslational regulation) in cultured rat cardiomyocytes. In turn, \u03b2\n1-integrin itself may exert its cell-protective effects \nby modifying ROS-signaling. Preliminary data suggest that \u03b2\n1-integrin expression is increased in response to Gq-cou -\npled receptor (GqCR)-stimulation in cardiomyocytes and that this increase is mediated via NADPH oxidase-derived ROS (Fig. 3). Likewise, NADPH oxidase-derived ROS seem involved in the regulation of \u03b2\n1-integrin function. We are \nnow further characterizing the NADPH oxidase-dependent pathways involved and we dissect the roles of distinct iso -\nforms of NADPH oxidase in the regulation of \u03b2\n1-integrin \nand its protective effects in cardiomyocytes. \nFigure 3\nReferences:\nHeineke J, Molkentin JD.

Then I went there.... and it was all true!\nThe meeting is held in Schloss Wolfsberg, on the Lake \nof Constance. The building belongs to UBS who sponsor the meeting.\nWhen you arrive there and if the weather is fine, you \nwill have a fantastic view of the lake and of the country -\nside, as the castle is on a small hill surrounded by a forest. Then when the gates of the congress centre open, you see the indoor swimming pool. This is the moment in which you start to think that this meeting is ranking up in your favourite Top Ten meetings. But you still have not seen the whole package...the rooms are really stylish and I don\u2019t know how many of us PhD students are used to staying in hotels with bathrooms with a stone shower, double sink and fading lights. But there is no time to spend there, the programme schedule is very strict and soon after arrival (10 minutes later!) the meeting starts.\nThe welcome speech from Prof. Hengartner is a mile -\nstone of the meeting, and the best part is when he gives the rules for making a good presentation: hold the pointer firmly; don\u2019t use it like a paintbrush; point it only where you want to highlight something; explain all the graphs (especially the axes); and don\u2019t overkill the audience. It seems reasonable, doesn\u2018t it? But don\u2019t underestimate an overexcited student at their first oral presentation! The en -\nvironment is so cool that very soon everybody realizes that this is not a \u201cnormal\u201d meeting. The audience is composed only of students, more or less 80 places are available, with students coming from Basel, Zurich, Bern, St.Gallen and  Bellinzona and seven Professors who lead the sessions. It\u2019s \nlike being in a big PhD student club where you feel free to ask questions and where it is possible to speak openly \nabout the technical problems that you might have encoun -\ntered during your experiments. First year students present \na poster in a poster session, while students of the second \nDBM Facts 2|2008 Department of BiomedicineDEPARTEMENT BIOMEDIZIN WISSENSCHAFT | SCIENCE 15\nand third year have a 10 minutes oral presentation. The \ninteraction between people is greatly encouraged. During coffee breaks, lunches, and dinners it is easy to speak with the other students and exchange ideas for experiments, or to learn some tricks on how to use a technique.\nThe food is another plus for this meeting. Forget the \ntasteless gummy congress lunches and welcome in the world of three course haute cuisine. They really know how to cook and when you have to choose between the menus (fish or meat? vegi? hard choice, ice cream or chocolate mousse? or maybe both?) you already foresee that it will \nbe good regardless. And in the evening after the last pre -\nsentation session of the day (never forget why you are \nthere!), you can stay in the lounge (with fireplace) for the last beer and the last chat. And after all these science talks don\u2019t you think it would be great to relax a little? Well, for this there is the \u201cfree sport evening\u201d where all the sport fa -\ncilities of the centre are open until 11 p.m. The swimming pool, the gym, the sauna, and the table tennis are all suit -\nable choices!\nIn previous years my motivation to play either basket -\nball or volleyball during those evenings was really high as Michel Mallaun and Marco Cavallari can witness, but last year after 3 minutes of the game I needed an oxygen mask and the following day I discovered the presence of totally unknown and forgotten muscles! So this year, which was unfortunately my last, I spent more time in the swimming pool and in the sauna than in the gym (getting older means getting wiser, or not?). In addition, this year Marco, Michel, and Heike Himmerleich organised a salsa  session that was particularly appreciated by the neighbouring rooms! Moreover, Marco and Michel proved to be real iron-men at all of the meetings: every morning at 6 a.m. they were off to the swimming pool for a \u201cwake up\u201d swim. They tried to convince other people to go with them... with no success!\nThe cherry on the cake of the meeting had always \nbeen the organized excursion: there are so many nice plac -\nes around the castle! This year we visited a restored mill that, in the past, harnessed water power to cut tree trunks. We were told the history of the mill and how a group of retired people decided to take on the challenge of restor -\ning the buildings around the mill, as well as the mill itself, and to transform it in a museum. Their next challenge is to replant and regrow the Mueller-Thurgau vine at its original site. We had a wine-testing and we can say that it is really good! In the three days meeting there was also time for a lecture from UBS where the Head of Wealth Management for the Zurich Region, Werner Peyes, showed us the trends in the market and, with very interesting interactive games, showed us how and where invest our money (when we have some, one day!).\nI hope that the new generation of Immunology PhD \nstudents of the institute will not miss the opportunity to attend this cool meeting. In addition to the fun that we had, there is the possibility to learn something in immu -\nnology fields different from our own, to meet people, net -\nwork, start the basis for future collaborations, and have a look of what is going on here in Switzerland in the other universities and institutes.\nFederica Facciotti\nSchloss Wolfsberg at the Lake \nof Constance (page 14), visiting the old mill \nin T\u00e4gerwilen (page 15).16 PUBLICATIONS DEPARTEMENT BIOMEDIZIN\nDBM Facts 2|2008 Departement BiomedizinThe  Journal of Experimental Medicine 205, 523\u2013531, 2008  IF 14,5\nAbstract: \nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) requires conditioning treatments such as irradiation, which leads to a severely delayed re-covery of T cell immunity and constitutes a major complication of this therapy.

The current standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) consists of a combination of pegylated IFN alpha (pegIFN\u03b1 ) and ribavirin. \nIt achieves a sustained viral clearance in only 50-60% of patients. To learn more about molecular mechanisms underlying treatment failure, we in-vestigated IFN-induced signaling in paired liver biopsies collected from CHC patients before and after administration of pegIFN\u03b1 . In patients with \na rapid virological response to treatment, pegIFN\u03b1  induced a strong up-\nregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). As shown previously, nonre-sponders had high expression levels of ISGs before therapy. Analysis of posttreatment biopsies of these patients revealed that pegIFN\u03b1  did not PNAS 105, 7034\u20137039, 2008  IF 9,6\nAmerican Journal of Transplantation 8, 1312\u20131317, 2008  IF 6,8\nAbstract: \nViral infection is a common complication after kidney transplantation. The role of natural killer cells (NK cells) in this setting remains unknown. NK cells express activating and inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). We analyzed whether activating KIR genes carried by kid-ney transplant-recipients influence the rate of viral infection during the first year after transplantation. In patients with a KIR A/A genotype (n = 40, KIR2DS4 only activating KIR) the rate of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infec-tion and reactivation was 36%, as compared to 20% in transplant recipi-ents with more than one activating KIR gene (KIR B/X genotype, n = 82, p = 0.04). Adjusting for other risk factors in Cox regression, the relative risk of B versus A genotype patients was 0.34 (95% CI 0.15-0.76, p = 0.009). The degree of protection increased with the number of activating KIR genes. Symptomatic CMV disease was only observed in four individuals, all carrying a KIR A/A genotype. As for viral infections other than CMV, and for bacterial infections, no KIR-linked protective effect could be detected. Also, graft function and the rate-rejection episodes were similar in KIR A/A and KIR B/X genotype individuals. This study supports a role for activat-ing KIR in the control of CMV infection after kidney transplantation.The Number of Activating KIR Genes Inversely Correlates with the Rate of CMV \nInfection/Reactivation in Kidney Transplant Recipients\nM.

In accordance \nwith ISG expression data, phosphorylation, DNA binding, and nuclear localization of STAT1 indicated that the IFN signaling pathway in nonre-sponsive patients is preactivated and refractory to further stimulation. Some features characteristic of nonresponders were more accentuated in patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 and 4 compared with genotypes 2 and 3, providing a possible explanation for the poor response of the former group to therapy. Taken together with previous findings, our data support the concept that activation of the endogenous IFN system in CHC not only is ineffective in clearing the infection but also may impede the response to therapy, most likely by inducing a refractory state of the IFN signaling pathway.18 PUBLICATIONS DEPARTEMENT BIOMEDIZIN\nDBM Facts 2|2008 Departement BiomedizinAbstract: \nPolymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are a key component of the in-nate immune system. Their activation leads to the release of potent an-timicrobial agents through degranulation. Simultaneously, PMNs release cell surface-derived microvesicles, so-called ectosomes (PMN-Ect). PMN-Ect are rightside-out vesicles with a diameter of 50-200 nm. They expose phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet of their membrane and down-modulate monocyte/macrophage-activation in vitro. In this study, we an-alyzed the effects of PMN-Ect on maturation of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). Intriguingly, exposing immature MoDCs to PMN-Ect modified their morphology, reduced their phagocytic activity, and in-The Journal of Immunology 180, 817\u2013824, 2008  IF 6,3\nThe Journal of Infectious Diseases 197, 1028\u20131035, 2008  IF 5,4\nAbstract: \nBACKGROUND:  \nBiofilm formation is considered to be an important virulence factor of the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis. We hypothesized \nthat biofilm formation could interfere with the deposition of immuno-globulins and complement on the bacterial surface, leading to dimin-ished activation of the complement system and protection from killing by human phagocytes. METHODS:  \nThe killing of biofilm-encased and planktonically grown wild-type (wt) S. epidermidis and the killing of an isogenic biofilm-negative ica mutant (ica\n-) by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were compared. \nC3a induction and deposition of C3b and immunoglobulin G (IgG) on the bacteria after opsonization with human serum were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy. The virulence of the bacterial strains was compared in a mouse model of catheter-associated infection. RESULTS:  \nBiofilm-embedded wt S. epidermidis was killed less well by human PMNs \nand induced more C3a than planktonically grown wt and ica\n- S. epidermi-\ndis. However, the deposition of C3b and IgG on the bacterial surface was diminished in biofilm-encased staphylococci. wt S. epidermidis was more \nvirulent in implant-associated infections and was killed more slowly than ica\n- in ex vivo assays of killing by PMNs. \nCONCLUSIONS:  \nThe results indicate that prevention of C3b and IgG deposition on the bac-terial surface contributes to the biofilm-mediated protection of S. epider-\nmidis from killing by PMNs.Biofilm Formation Induces C3a Release and Protects Staphylococcus  \nepidermidis from IgG and Complement Deposition and from Neutrophil-\nDependent Killing\nS.A.

When immature MoDCs were incubated \nwith PMN-Ect and stimulated with the TLR4 ligand LPS, the maturation \nprocess was partially inhibited as evidenced by reduced expression of cell surface markers (CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, and HLA-DP DQ DR), inhibi-tion of cytokine-release (IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1 ), and a reduced ca-\npacity to induce T cell proliferation. Together these data provide evidence that PMN-Ect have the ability to modify MoDC maturation and function. PMN-Ect may thus represent an as yet unidentified host-factor influenc-ing MoDC maturation at the site of injury, thereby possibly impacting on downstream MoDC-dependent immunity.\n1 Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Research, University Hospitals Basel\n2 Center for Microscopy, Pharmazentrum, Basel, Switzerland \n3 Microbial Genetics, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany \n4 Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine, University of Wales Swansea, \nSwansea, United KingdomDEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICINE PUBLICATIONS 19\nDBM Facts 2|2008 Department of BiomedicineAbstract: \nThe high-affinity Na+-dependent carnitine transporter OCTN2 (SLC22A5) has a high renal expression and reabsorbs most filtered carnitine. To gain more insight into substrate specificity of OCTN2, we overexpressed hOCTN2 in L6 cells and characterized the structural requirements of sub-stances acting as human OCTN2 (hOCTN2) inhibitors. A 1905-bp fragment containing the hOCTN2 complete coding sequence was introduced into the pWpiresGFP vector, and L6 cells were stably transduced using a len-tiviral system.

The catabolic view, mainly based on correlative studies in human and in vivo animal models, was challenged by experiments with myoblasts, in which TNF-al-pha induced differentiation. The biological effects of TNF-\u03b1  in differenti-\nated muscle, however, remain poorly understood. In the present study, we tested whether TNF-\u03b1  has growth-promoting effects in myotubes, \nand we characterized the mechanisms leading to these effects. Treat-ment of C\n2C12 myotubes with TNF-\u03b1  for 24 h increased protein synthesis \n(PS) and enhanced cellular dehydrogenase activity by 22 and 26%, re-spectively, without changing cell numbers. These effects were confirmed in myotubes differentiated from primary rat myoblasts. TNF-\u03b1  activated \ntwo signaling cascades: 1) ERK1/2 and its target eIF4E and 2) Akt and its downstream effectors GSK-3, p70\nS6K, and 4E-BP1. TNF-\u03b1 -induced phos-\nphorylation of Akt, and ERK1/2 was inhibited by an antibody against TNF-\u03b1 receptor 1 (TNF-R1). PD-98059 pretreatment abolished TNF-\u03b1 -induced \nphosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eIF4E, whereas PS was only partially in-hibited. LY-294002 completely abolished TNF-\u03b1 -induced stimulation of \nPS as well as phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream targets GSK-3, p70\nS6K, and 4E-BP1. Rapamycin inhibited TNF-\u03b1 -induced phosphoryla-\ntion of the mTOR C1 target p70S6K without altering TNF-\u03b1 -induced PS \nand 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that TNF-\u03b1  enhances PS in myotubes and that this is based on enhanced \nprotein translation mediated by the TNF-R1 and PI3K-Akt and MEK-ERK signaling cascades.TNF-\u03b1 increases protein content in C2C12 and primary myotubes by enhancing \nprotein translation via the TNF-R1, PI3K, and MEK\n I.

Therefore, heterozygous juvenile visceral steatosis (jvs)(\n+/-) mice, an animal model with decreased carnitine \nstores caused by impaired renal reabsorption of carnitine, and the cor-responding wild-type mice were treated with subtoxic oral doses of VPA (0.1 g/g b.wt./day) for 2 weeks. In jvs(\n+/-) mice, but not in wild-type mice, \ntreatment with VPA was associated with the increased plasma activity of aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase. Furthermore, jvs(\n+/-) mice revealed reduced palmitate metabolism assessed in vivo \nand microvesicular steatosis of the liver. The creatine kinase activity was not affected by treatment with VPA.

Because inhibition or control of NF-\u03ba B signaling in the heart probably confers \ncardioprotection, we determined the potency of the NF-\u03ba B inhibitor di-\nmethyl fumarate (DMF) in cardiovascular cells, and determined wheth-er administration of DMF translates into beneficial effects in an animal model of myocardial infarction. In rat heart endothelial cells (RHEC), we analysed inhibitory effects of DMF on NF-\u03ba B using shift assay and immu-\nnohistofluorescence. In in vivo experiments, male Sprague Dawley rats undergoing left coronary artery occlusion for 45 min received either DMF (10 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle 90 min before ischemia as well as im-mediately before ischemia. After 120 min of reperfusion, the hearts were stained with phthalocyanine blue dye and triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Additionally, acute hemodynamic and electrophysiologic effects of DMF were determined in dose\u2013response experiments in isolated perfused rat hearts. DMF inhibited TNF-\u03b1 -induced nuclear entry of NF-\u03ba B in RHEC. In in \nvivo experiments, myocardial infarct size was significantly smaller in rats that had received DMF (20.7% \u00b1 9.7% in % of risk area; n = 17) than in con-\ntrol rats (28.2% \u00b1 6.2%; n = 15). Dose\u2013response experiments in isolated \nperfused rat hearts excluded acute hemodynamic or electrophysiologic effects as mechanisms for the effects of DMF. DMF inhibits nuclear entry of NF-\u03ba B in RHEC and reduces myocardial infarct size after ischemia and \nreperfusion in rats in vivo.

Treatment with VPA was associated with an additional decrease in carnitine plasma (wild-type mice and jvs(\n+/-) mice) and tissue levels (jvs(+/-) mice) and a shift of \nthe carnitine pools toward short-chain acylcarnitines. We conclude that jvs(\n+/-) mice reveal a more accentuated hepatic toxicity by VPA than the \ncorresponding wild-type mice. Therefore, decreased carnitine body stores can be regarded as a risk factor for hepatotoxicity associated with VPA.DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICINE PUBLICATIONS 21\nDBM Facts 2|2008 Department of BiomedicineAnnals of Nutrition & Metabolism 52, 136\u2013144, 2008  IF 1,6\nAbstract: \nBackground/Aims:  \nJuvenile visceral steatosis (jvs-/-) mice lack the activity of the carnitine transporter OCTN2 and are dependent on carnitine substitution. The ef-fects of carnitine deprivation on carnitine homeostasis and energy me-tabolism are not known in jvs-/- mice. Methods:  \njvs-/- mice were studied 3, 6 and 10 days after carnitine deprivation, and compared to jvs-/- mice substituted with carnitine, wild-type (jvs+/+) and jvs+/- mice. Carnitine concentrations were assessed radioenzymatically. Results: Compared to wild-type mice, carnitine-treated jvs-/- mice had decreased plasma \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate levels and showed hepatic fat accumulation. The carnitine levels in plasma, liver and skeletal muscle were decreased by 58, 16 and 17%, respectively. After ten days of carnitine deprivation, the plasma carnitine concentration had fallen by 87% (to 2.3 \u03bcmol/l) and \nthe tissue carnitine levels by \u224850% compared to carnitine-treated jvs-/- \nmice. Carnitine deprivation was associated with a further drop in plasma \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate and increased hepatic fat. Skeletal muscle glycogen \nstores decreased and lactate levels increased with carnitine deprivation, whereas tissue ATP levels were maintained. Conclusions: In jvs-/- mice, tissue carnitine stores are more resistant than carnitine plasma concentrations to carnitine deprivation. Metabolic changes (liver steatosis and loss of muscle glycogen stores) appear also early after car-nitine deprivation.Effect of Carnitine Deprivation on Carnitine Homeostasis and Energy  \nMetabolism in Mice with Systemic Carnitine Deficiency\nA.

Using a reporter gene assay with firefly luciferase as readout, significant reduction of TGF\u03b2 3 bioactivity was detected to occur \nboth in serum containing medium (SCM) and serum free medium (SFM).

The reduction of TGF\u03b23 bioactivity had a negligible influence in a typical biological assay \n(e.g., chondrocyte proliferation), supporting the possibility of prolonged storage of medium pre-supplemented with TGF\u03b2 3 for bioreactor-based \nchondrocyte expansion.

Recently, several cases of hepatotoxicity have been published. To explore possible mechanisms of kava hepatotoxicity, we prepared and analyzed three different kava extracts (a methanolic and an acetonic root and a methanolic leaf extract), and investigated their toxicity on HepG2 cells and isolated rat liver mitochondria. All three extracts showed cyto-toxicity starting at a concentration of 50 \u03bc g/ml (lactate dehydrogenase \nleakage) or 1 \u03bcg/ml (MTT test). The mitochondrial membrane potential \nwas decreased (root extracts starting at 50 \u03bcg/ml) and the respiratory chain inhibited and uncoupled (root extracts) or only uncoupled (leaf extract) at 150 \u03bcg/ml, and mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation was inhibited by \nall extracts starting at 100 \u03bcg/ml. The ratio oxidized to reduced glutathi-\none was increased in HepG2 cells, whereas the cellular ATP content was maintained. Induction of apoptosis was demonstrated by all extracts at a concentration of 150 \u03bcg/ml. These results indicate that the kava extracts \nare toxic to mitochondria, leading to inhibition of the respiratory chain, increased ROS production, a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential and eventually to apoptosis of exposed cells.

It takes place on the weekend closest to June 24th , the weekend after the longest day of the year. The \u201cbiggest\u201d day is always the Sa -\nturday, but the whole celebration lasts from Friday till Sunday. In the other Scandinavian countries, as well as in the Baltic region, midsum -\nmer was actually a dedication to John the Baptist. Not so in Sweden. There, it was only a happy time, spent together with family, friends, and neighbours. People are pro -\nbably rejoicing at such a wonderful moment of the year, when the dark long nights of winter are so dis -\ntant. The spirit of midsummer has a particularly large influence on the people in the countryside, and the celebration is probably most pro -\nnounced among the people in the area where I was born and raised. This part of Sweden, Dalarna, is where a ski race takes place over 85 kilometres at the beginning of March, in remembrance of the at -\ntempted escape of the young  Gus -\ntav Eriksson Wasa, as he discovered, in his struggle to free the country from the Danes, that he had no support. As the people of this re -\ngion realized they had made a mis -\ntake, two young men were sent out to catch up with him. They did so at the Norwegian border. This histori -\ncal incident is the founding story \nof the ski race \u201cWasaloppet\u201d. The \nfreedom fighter was later to be -\ncome the king of Sweden on June 6th 1523 under the name of Gutav Wasa. \n\u201cMajst\u00e0ngen\u201d and traditional \ncostumesPeople in this area are very bound to cultural traditions as well as be -\ning freedom loving. It has a wonder -\nful landscape with green meadows, blue lakes, the famous red wooden houses with white corners and lots and lots of birch trees. When the very symbol of midsummer  \u201cMajst\u00e0ngen\u201d, a high wooden pole, is raised in the middle of a green \nfield, it carries a garland made out of  birch branches and lovely wild flowers from the meadows. The garland will be carried through the main street of the village by young and old, all dressed in tra -\nDBM Facts 2|2008 Department of Biomedicineditional costumes. The procession \nis headed by two horse riders, as it proudly moves down the people lined streets in the direction of the celebration ground. The \u201cMajst\u00e0n -\ngen\u201d is then decorated  and raised and everybody sings the traditional songs, as they dance hand in hand around this symbol of midsummer. Many Swedes travel to this area dur -\ning the midsummer days. Maybe \nthey have roots there. Many do and \nare proudly declaring it. If it is pos -\nsible, they will also try to get hold of a traditional costume, which nowadays are very rare and hard to come by as all the individual pieces are handcrafted, and there are very few individuals left who posses the skills to make these garments.\nIt is like you enter a different \nworld during this time. After the dancing, and singing of the folk -\nsongs, and the children\u2018s songs around \u201cMajst\u00e0ngen\u201d, the program moves on to the performances of costumed show dancers and a team playing old traditional folk music on the violin. Their musical know -\nledge is handed down over genera -\ntions, and many songs have never been put on paper, but have always been handed down from father to son. The best players are awarded an honorary title of the country \n\u201cRiksspelman\u201d. There is also always \na possibility for the audience to participate in the traditional danc -\ning. All through these \u201chappen -\nings\u201d, people will surely also feel \nlike ha  ving a snack now and then. \nThere is a special bread made out \nof potatoes and cooked in a wood fired oven. It is served as rolls with homemade butter, filled with fresh cheese and chives, fresh brown cheese or herring. Wonderful!\nThe festivities are held in all the \nvillages surrounding a large lake, the Siljansee. A long time ago, when people were dependent on boats to get from one village to the other, or even from one farming area to the other, they had these big ves -\nsels rowed by 8-10 oarsmen. They were used especially when people went to church on Sundays. In the village Leksand, boats from differ -\nent villages are raced, and it is a big, joyous, spectacle. On the decora -\nted gangways on the lake, where the other boats come and go, there is music and dancing.\nIn their homes, people invite \nfriends from near and far and enjoy \n\u201csm\u00f6rg\u00e0sbord\u201d which is a buffet \ncontaining all of the Swedish spe -\ncialities your heart could possibly desire. There are meatballs, salad with red beets, herring in all forms, and of course \u201cJanssons frestels\u201d, a potato gratin with onion and small salty herring, a real classic! And of course along with that there is beer and \u201cnubbe\u201d, which is Aquavit, as well as singing and cheering.  \nYoung girls become romantic\nWhen finally the sun sinks down just a little bit below the horizon  for a couple of hours, and the elves and the trolls appear at their forest \nstage, dancing and giving the night \na magic touch, that is the time when the dew will form. It is said it \nhas healing properties for both sick \nanimals and human beings. Maybe on this wonderful night young girls \nbecome romantic and collect 7 wild \nflowers to put under their pillows so that they will dream of their fu -\nture loved ones, the ones that will become their husbands. However, they must tell no-one about it, as otherwise their dreams will not come true. \nLena Angman\nLena Angman with her traditional \nMidsummer costume\nDEPARTMENT BIOMEDICINE USB FEUILLETON 2930 SPORT | SPORTS DEPARTEMENT BIOMEDIZIN USB\nDBM Facts 2|2008 Departement Biomedizin\n4:3\nMatch report on the DBM PhD Student Club friendship football game on  April 26, 2008\nPetrus and Fortuna were on the \nside of the Swiss football team on that  beautiful Saturday afternoon last April, when the students of the DBM PhD student club met for a friendship game \u201cSwitzer-land \u2013  Germany\u201d.  \nBefore the game, every mem-\nber of the Student Club had to decide on  which team she or he wanted to play.

Af-ter the regular time the score was 3:3  and the Swiss needed extra time and extra luck to decide the game in  their favour. From the beginning the German team set the pace to a  technically and physically intense match and already scored for the  first time after 8 minutes. The Swiss were able to tie before the  break, making use of all their individual skills as well as a solid  \nteam performance. After the break the German team \ntook the lead twice  more with their goals bringing \nDEPARTMENT BIOMEDICINE USB SPORT | SPORTS 31\nDBM Facts 2|2008 Department of Biomedicine\nthe score to 1:2 and 2:3. But each \ntime  the Swiss made use of their female specialists Cornelia Bigler (2:2)  and G\u00e9raldine Guex (3:3) to stay in the game. In the extra time both  teams had good chances to decide the game, but it was finally Simon  J\u00f6rger with an irresistable long distance shot that decided the game  for the Swiss. It was an exciting and very fair game, with \ngreat  teams and remarkable goals \n(the 3rd German goal scored by \nMathias Mehling  must be consid-ered world class).\nMichel MallaunDBM Facts 2|2008 Departement Biomedizin32 KULINARISCHES | CULINARY DEPARTEMENT BIOMEDIZIN USB\nChumm, mir wei go Chirseli g\u00fcnne,\nweiss ame Ort gar cheibe vil;roti, schwarzi, bipelig\u00e4li,zw\u00f6i bis dr\u00fc a einem Stiil ...(Schweizer Kinderlied)\nChirsizyt \nmit dr Grossmueter\nWilde Kirschen waren schon immer heiss begehrt.

Verena J\u00e4gginDBM Facts 2|2008 Departement BiomedizinWie alles begann\nIch bin in Basel geboren, sp\u00e4t ge-nug, um keine 68erin mehr zu sein. Nach den Jugendjahren in Bottmingen im Haus meines Ur-grossvaters und anschliessend in Binningen verbrachte ich meine Teenagerjahre in der Christoph-Merian-Siedlung auf dem Bruder-holz. In einer Phase, wo mir alles zu langweilig geworden war, schmiss \nich das Gymnasium und wollte \n\u00abins Leben eintreten\u00bb. Ich machte eine kaufm\u00e4nnische Lehre bei der National-Versicherung. Dann wur-de es endlich spannend: Ich reis-te mit Interrail in Europa herum und genoss anschliessend einen dreimonatigen Sprachaufenthalt in Perugia - ich liebe Italien in jeder Beziehung! Zur\u00fcck in der Schweiz begl\u00fcckte ich die Assista Rechts-schutzversicherung in Genf, die Pax Versicherung in Basel jeweils als Sachbearbeiterin und seit 1985 bin ich f\u00fcr das Sekretariat des Phy-siologischen Instituts zust\u00e4ndig. \nWas macht die denn eigentlich \nden ganzen Tag?Bis Fr\u00fchjahr 2001 war Prof. Leon-hard H\u00f6sli Vorsteher des Physiolo-gischen Instituts und mein Chef.

Seit-her ist mein Arbeitsplatz im Phar-mazentrum, 7. Stock, von wo ich einen wunderbaren Ausblick auf die Umgebung geniesse. Allerdings habe ich wenig Zeit, mich dem Blick in die Ferne hinzugeben, denn die Zahlen wollen geh\u00e4uft werden, die Administration muss brummen, die Buchhaltung ins Lot gebracht werden, die Anstellungen m\u00fcssen klappen und diverses Material ent-weder ins Haus kommen oder sei-nen Weg in die Welt finden. Dazu stehen Abkl\u00e4rungen mit anderen Dienststellen und Bereichen, Aus-k\u00fcnfte und Hilfestellungen an. Und nat\u00fcrlich versuche ich, die Agenda meines sympathischen Chefs im Auge zu behalten.

The PSF itself is a pro -\nbability map: not all the photons emitted by a point source and refracted by a lens converge onto the image point cor -\nresponding to the object. The probability that they do is high, but not as high as 100%. Some photons end up in the space surrounding this point, with probabilities inversely related to distance from it. The map showing these prob -\nabilities in 3-dimensional image space represents the PSF (Fig. 2, High intensity stands for high probability of photon \nincidence).\nThe PSF is dependent on the optical system and leads to \na degradation of the image. The degree of blurring is an indi -\ncation for the quality of an imaging system. Imaging a point \nsource on a confocal microscope for example will always ap -\npear as an extended blurry spot. The process that leads to the formation of such an image is called convolution.\nKnowing the PSF of a microscope, an image correspond -\ning to the original object can be constructed using a math -\nematical algorithm. This process \u2013 the opposite of convolu -\ntion \u2013 is called deconvolution (Fig. 1b).The Point Spread Function (PSF)As already mentioned the PSF depends on the optical sys -\ntem. We can obtain it in two ways:1.  By measuring the actual PSF of a particular microscope. \nThis is done by recording images of small beads of known size. The images are then used to calculate the PSF.\n2.  By calculating a theoretical PSF from the technical pa -\nrameters of the microscope (numerical aperture, magni -\nfication, and wavelength).\nThe first method yields more accurate results, because it takes the characteristics of a particular optical system into account \u2013 lens defects, for example. On the other hand, multiple measurements have to be taken, since all the set -\ntings (lens, wavelength etc.) adopted for taking the image of the specimen have to be identical when measuring the PSF.Calculating a theoretical PSF is obviously much easier, but not as precise. However, it will do in most cases.\nSampling conditions\nImages destined for deconvolution have to meet the follow -\ning criteria:\nDeconvolution is a process based on a mathematical algorithm to reverse the effect of convolu-\ntion that occurs during image acquisition on an optical microscope. Deconvolution is therefore \nused during image processing to recover objects from an image that is degraded by blurring \nand noise.38 KONKRET | CONCRETE DEPARTEMENT BIOMEDIZIN, MATTENSTRASSE 28\nFigure 1a\n Figure 1bDBM Facts 2|2008 Department of Biomedicine\u2022  The sampling density of an image stack has to be ade -\nquate, meaning: the pixel size and the distance between \nthe  image planes have to be small enough, close to the Ny -\nquist rate. Therefore the image has to be sampled at least twice the maximum frequency of the pattern (Fig. 3).\n\u2022  Clipping must be avoided. Clipping occurs if the dynamic range is exceeded and brightness values are either satu -\nrated (255 in an 8bit image) or black (0).\n\u2022  The dimensions of an image stack have to be chosen such that the top and bottom planes lie outside the object.Unfortunately, Nyquist sampling is often difficult to achieve. The high sampling densities may result in long acquisition times and excessive bleaching of the fluorescent marker. \nAnd the large file sizes make heavy demands on computer \nmemory, not only during the deconvolution process itself, but also when handling the deconvolved image stacks.It therefore stands to reason that optimal sampling is not al-ways possible, and that compromises have to be made. De -\nconvolution is a nice tool, but good results are not achieved without an adequate effort!\nHuygens at the DBM Mattenstrasse\nWe are using the Huygens Professional deconvolution soft -\nware from Scientific Volume Imaging (SVI; Hilversum, NL). It is a state of the art package used by leading imaging facili -\nties (Fig. 4).At Mattenstrasse 28, we are running Huygens on a Linux \nserver equipped with two Dual Core AMD Opteron 2220 \nprocessors and 16GB of DDR2 memory.
