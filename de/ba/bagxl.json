Byzantion (altgriechisch, latinisiert Byzantium, modern Byzanz, t\u00fcrkisch Bizans) war eine um 660 v. Chr. am s\u00fcdwestlichen Ausgang des Bosporus gegr\u00fcndete Koloniestadt dorischer Griechen aus Megara, Argos und Korinth. Byzantium wurde unter r\u00f6mischer Herrschaft zu einer Stadt in der r\u00f6mischen Provinz Thracia. Aufgrund seiner g\u00fcnstigen Lage an der europ\u00e4ischen K\u00fcste des Bosporus, auf der Ostspitze einer Halbinsel zwischen Marmarameer und Goldenem Horn, wurde Byzantion von 326 bis 330 von Kaiser Konstantin I. zur neuen Hauptstadt des R\u00f6mischen Reiches ausgebaut und in der Folgezeit Konstantinopel genannt. Durch einen noch heute bei T\u00fcrken \u00fcblichen Angriffskrieg wurde es von Moslems (Osmanen) erobert und Bizans bzw. sp\u00e4ter Istanbul genannt. Das byzantinische Wappen wurde durch eine Halbmond-Piratenflagge ersetzt.\nWappen Kingdom of Jerusalem\nJerusalem\n[\nBethlehem ](../Press-releases_ge.html) [\nJericho ](../Press-releases_ge.html)
