India has one of the longest unbroken health traditions, which comprises of not only generations of practitioners but also traditional and theoretical foundations in terms of Ayurvedic system of medicine / Traditional Indian Medicine (TIM). These practitioners and practices have even made their presence felt outside of India. As a qualified Ayurvedic doctor from India I have had the opportunity to come across different experiences, which made me settle on selecting this topic for study. Much like most of the eastern traditions in Germany, the Ayurvedic system has drifted away from its original form. Although thousands of Ayurveda centres are mushrooming throughout Europe, many of these centres are promoting this science as a wellness and massage system, whilst others promote it as esoteric. The authenticity of these centres remains the big question. Realising this is an alarming situation, I believe the need to standardize Ayurvedic system is imperative. However, this cannot be realized without first performing a detailed study about the Ayurvedic system in Germany. This was the only option to fully quantify the extent of the actual situation. This study focuses on the potential benefits to be gained by the integration of Ayurveda in the general practice of German doctors. This is an exploratory qualitative research project focused on the integration of Ayurveda into western medicine which uses the example of German doctors practicing in private practices.\n[Effective integration of Traditional Indian Medicine (TIM) [pdf 2.53 mb]](/obvuklhs/download/pdf/2414651?originalFilename=true)", "language": null, "image": "http://netlibrary.aau.at/obvuklhs/download/webcache/304/", "pagetype": "book", "links": ["#leftParts", "#centerParts", "https://www.aau.at", "/UKL/", "/obvuklhs/wiki/info", "/action/changeLanguage?lang=en", null, "/search", "/obvukloa", "/obvukloaz", "/obvuklhs/facet/type/nav/index/all", "/obvuklhs/nav/history", "/", "/obvukloa", "/obvuklhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=bib.personalName%3D%22Kumar%2C%20Syal%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuklhs sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvuklhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=bib.personalName%3D%22Heller%2C%20Andreas%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuklhs sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvuklhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=bib.personalName%3D%22Gronemeyer%2C%20Reimer%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuklhs sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvuklhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=(bib.originPlace%3D%22Klagenfurt%22)%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuklhs sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvuklhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22Traditionelle%20Indische%20Medizin%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuklhs sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvuklhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22Ayurveda%20Medizin%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuklhs sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvuklhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22Indische%20Medizin%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuklhs sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvuklhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22Ayurveda%20Medizin%20in%20der%20Integrativen%20Medizin%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuklhs sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvuklhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22Traditional%20Indian%20Medicine%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuklhs sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvuklhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22Ayurveda%20Medicine%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuklhs sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvuklhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22Indian%20Medicine%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuklhs sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvuklhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22Ayurveda%20Medicine%20in%20the%20Intergrative%20Medicine%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuklhs sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvuklhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22Klagenfurt%20am%20W%C3%B6rthersee%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuklhs sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "http://d-nb.info/gnd/1023732653", "/obvuklhs/wiki/identifier/urnresolving?urn=urn:nbn:at:at-ubk:1-23109", "https://permalink.obvsg.at/UKL/AC12609527", "/obvuklhs/download/pdf/2414651?originalFilename=true", "/nav/classification/1828899", "/nav/classification/1828900", "/nav/classification/1828902", "/nav/classification/108912", "/nav/classification/109857", "/nav/classification/109934", "/obvuklhs/wiki/termsOfUse", "/obvuklhs/wiki/faq", "http://search.obvsg.at/UKL", "http://www.aau.at/ub", "https://www.aau.at", "mailto:netlibrary@aau.at", "http://www.aau.at/ub", "http://www.aau.at/ub", "/obvuklhs/doc/contact", "/obvuklhs/doc/imprint", "http://www.semantics.de/produkte/visual_library/"]}
