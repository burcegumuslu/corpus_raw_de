From a practice -theoretical perspective, the paper \ndiscusses the interferences of medicine, religion, and spirituality in the fie ld of \nanthroposophical end -of-life care. It describes the main practices conducted \nthroughout the different stages of end -of-life care in this hospital and relates them to \ntheir rationalizations by medical actors as well as to basic anthroposophical concepts. \nBesides, the authors analyze power struggles between different actors displaying \nvarious dispositions concerning conventional and anthroposophical medicine, the latter integrating religious and spiritual aspects. The paper concludes by arguing that \n(1) there is a shift of relevance with regard to body -oriented and discursive practices \nin the course of anthroposophical end -of-life care, with a stronger emphasis on body -\noriented practices at later stages. Moreover, (2) body -oriented practices, if rational ized \nin a religious way, serve as a resource not only for patients, but for staff members, \ntoo. Finally, (3) the contested issue of administering pain -killers and sedatives at the \nend of life in this hospital revealed that in many cases, nurses, despite their inferior \nposition compared to physicians, succeeded in their wish to act in discordance with \nanthroposophical principles.  \n 202 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n 1  INTRODUCTION1 \n \nIn 2012, the Swiss people voted in favor of a popular petition to integrate \nanthroposophic2 medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, neu-\nral therapy, and herbal medicine into the official list of services covered by \nobligatory health insurance. As a consequence, all expenses for these types of treatment will henceforth be covered, if they are provided or prescribed by trained physicians. This indicates a growing social acceptance of Com-plementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)\n3 in Switzerland as part of the \nestablished health-care system.4 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1  All the empirical data on anthroposophical end-of-life care used in this article \ncome from a case s tudy conducted by Barbara Zeugin within the broader context \nof a research project on Alternative Religiosity and its Consequences at the End \nof Life funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation ( cp. www.nfp67.ch/  \nen/projects/module-4- cultural -concepts -social -ideals/project -lueddeckens , July \n4, 2018 ). We would like to convey our special thanks to all the managerial staff \nin the hospital where Zeugi n conducted her fieldwork, to the leading internist, \nwho introduced and mentored her, and to all employees and patients who wel-\ncomed her with open arms. Without their willingness to share their thoughts and \nexperiences with her, this fieldwork would not ha ve been possible. The research \nproject was approved by the Kantonale Ethikkommission Z\u00fcrich. Aside from the relevant literature, the few remarks in this article on conventional palliative care are based on Dorothea L\u00fcddecken\u2019s fieldwork in a Swiss conventi onal palliative \ncare unit conducted in 2016.\n \n2  We decided to use the term \u201canthroposophic  medicine\u201d  instead of \u201c anthroposoph-\nical medicine\u201d  so as to acknowledge the most common emic language usage, in \nline with Kienle et al. (2006) .  \n3  Gale and McHale\u2019s c ollection (2015) gives an overview of CAM, J\u00fctte (1996) \nintroduces the history of CAM, and Crawford (2003) discusses terminological issues.  \n4  The website of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health provides information about all policies related to the i ncorporation of CAM into the public health sector  \n(cp. www.bag.admin.ch/themen/gesundheitspolitik/03153/index.html?lang =de, \nJuly 4, 2018).  Puustinen (2014) has criticiz ed the incorporation of anthroposoph-\nical medicine into the Swiss health -care sector by claiming that its religious ori-\nentation is incompatible with the  principles of natural science.  Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland | 203 \n \n Alongside these developments, the social sciences are also showing an \nincreasing interest in CAM. Social scientists are either examining particular \nexamples of CAM or else discussing its relationship to conventional medi-cine ( cp. Jeserich 2010). Scholars in the Study of Religion, on the other hand, \ntend to scrutinize relationships between religion and medicine by referring mostly to discursive data material, that is, to written and oral data. Most of these studies discuss particular healing practices such as Ayurveda (cp. Koch \n2006a, 2006b; Koch/Binder 2013; L\u00fcddeckens 2018) or address the issue more generally (cp. Brown 2013; Koch 2015; L\u00fcddeckens 2012, 2013). The latter approach often leads to the conclusion that, while CAM stems from \nspecific religious traditions, it also forms an interface between religion and \nmedicine. While this article agrees with this conclusion, it differs methodo-logically from these earlier studies, which restrict their analyses to the level of conceptualization by using only discursive data. Instead, this article at-tends not only to what people say but also to what they do, that is, to how they act.\n5 Thus, the central focus is on the social practice of anthroposophical \nend-of-life care using one particular anthroposophical hospital as a case study.\n6 \nAdopting a practice-theoretical perspective on religion has proved to be \na promising endeavor in recent research in the Study of Religion (cp. Echt-ler/Ukah 2016a; Utriainen 2013; Walthert 2014; Wood 2007; Wright/Rawls 2005). Within practice theory, Bourdieu\u2019s terms and concepts are quite \nprominent and allow not only varied sets of actions to be differentiated as \nspecific to a certain group of people (habitus), but also their attribution to a specific realm (social field). Whereas scholars have already worked on the religious field (cp. Bourdieu 2000; Echtler/Ukah 2016b), this article deals with the intersection between it and the medical field. \nThis specific focus is due to the fact that anthroposophical end-of- life \ncare unfolds in a particular historical, social, and institutional context that already indicates a position between (alternative) religion\n7 and (convent-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n5  Cp. Mezger 2018.  \n6  A communication -theoretical approach may represent  another way of escaping a \nconceptualizing view of CAM (cp. Zeugin 2017).  \n7  The term \u201calternative religion\u201d is used in this paper as an etic category. In general , \npractitioners of anthroposophic medicine do not consider themselves to belong to 204 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n ional) medicine8. The practice of anthroposophical end-of- life care  combines \nthe basic principles of conventional medicine with alternative religious be-\nliefs and practices, as anthroposophic medicine has aimed to counter-balance the one-sided notion of conventional medicine since its beginnings:  \n \n\u201cThis is not an opposition against contemporary medicine working with scientifically \nacknowledged methods. We fully accept this medicine in her princi ples. And in our \nopinion what we offer should only be used by that practitioner of the art of medicine who can be considered a full physician according to these principles.\u201d (Stei-ner/Wegman 2014: 7)\n9 \n \nAnthroposophic medicine claims to undo the mechanistic and fragmentary \nconceptions of human beings that allegedly exist in contemporary conven-tional medicine by re-integrating \u201cspiritual science\u201d (\u201cGeisteswissenschaft\u201d in German) into medical practice. Steiner frequently used \u201cGeisteswissen-schaft\u201d as a synonym of anthroposophy to highlight the aspect of spiritual \nscience that goes along with the anthroposophical worldview. In this sense, \n\u201cGeisteswissenschaft\u201d means the aim and claim to describe \u201cdas Geistige\u201d, \u201cthe spiritual,\u201d exactly and methodically.\n10 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \nthe realm o f religion, nor to alternative religion. From an emic perspective, an-\nthroposophy is seen at most as \u201c spiritual\u201d.  \n8  We use \u201cconventional medicine\u201d in this paper as an etic category. German texts \nwritten by anthroposophical authors mainly use the term \u201cSchu lmedizin\u201d or just \n\u201cMedizin.\u201d Kienle, Kiene and Albonico use the term \u201cscientific medicine\u201d, and \nremark that \u201cAnthroposophic medicine considers itself to be an extension of sci-entific medicine\u201d ( 2006: 4).\n \n9  This translation and all following translations o f texts originally in German are \nmade by the authors of this article.  \n10  The English version of the official website of the \u201cSchool of science \u201d of the An-\nthroposophical Society at the Goetheanum explains: \u201c In 1924 Rudolf Steiner de-\nveloped a course of study based on meditative exercises that lead \u2018the spiritual in \nthe human being to the spiritual in the universe.\u2019 This is the basis for the work of the School of Spiritual Science. It is also the background of the research, teaching, and training activities of the General Anthroposophical Section \u201d (https : \n//www.goetheanum.org/en/school- of-spiritual -science, March 8, 2018).   | 205 \n \n According to the subtitle of Steiner and Wegman\u2019s Grundlegendes f\u00fcr \neine Erweiterung der Heilkunst nach geisteswissenschaftlichen Erkenntnis-\nsen (1977), their motive for founding anthroposophic medicine consisted in \nthe desire to extend the art of healing through spiritual knowledge (\u201cErwei-\nterung der Heilkunst nach geisteswissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen\u201d). Thus, \ncombining conventional medicine with anthroposophy and thus with alter-native religious beliefs and practices was intended from the outset. \nFrom the perspective of the Study of Religion, anthroposophy can be cat-\negorized as a form of alternative religiosity, that is, as a contemporary reli-\ngious phenomenon that in some ways represents an alternative to mainstream \nreligions.\n The attribution of these forms of religion as alternatives points to \nthe fact that alternative religions draw on sources that do not form part of the \ndominant canons of religious belief and practice (Knoblauch 2009: 104). Moreover, by referring to religiosity, the emphasis lies on individual rather than institutional forms of religion (cp. Luckmann 2005). In recent decades, alternative religious beliefs and practices have been widely diffused through-\nout society, with medicine and CAM leading the way (cp. L\u00fcddeckens/Wal-\nthert 2010a, 2010b). Hence, the attribution of these forms of religion as \u201cal-ternative\u201d is increasingly losing its legitimacy. However, in contrast to other\n \nterms, it still has important advantages: unlike the terms \u201cagnostic,\u201d \u201cfuzzy,\u201d \u201cpopular religion\u201d or \u201cspirituality,\u201d \u201calternative\u201d provides information about a form of religiosity's current position in the religious field. \nThe narrative of re-integrating \u201cspiritual science,\u201d and therefore from an \netic point of view (alternative) religion, into medicine is only plausible when the respective fields have already been subjected to processes of differentia-tion, as is true of conventional medicine and of caring for the terminally ill.\n11 \nThe continuing differentiation between religious and medical actors was strongly criticized (Kellehear 2007: 157), and, as a result, the conventional \nmedical paradigm of palliative care developed as a counter-balance to the \nmedicalization of dying and death (Walter 1994: 12\u201313). From its very be-ginning, (conventional) palliative care was not only informed by conven-tional medical care, it also included religion and spirituality (\u201cspiritual care\u201d) in its treatment of the terminally ill and dying. This multidisciplinary ap-proach to palliative care is often traced to Cicely Saunders and the hospice \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n11  L\u00fcddeckens (this volume) examines the interrelatedness of CAM with religion \nand medicine using the concept of de- differentiation.

In one of her lectures at \nYale University in 1963, Saunders suggested introducing palliative care as a form of holistic care that involves the treatment of \u201cphysical, spiritual, and psychological discomfort\u201d alike (Lutz 2011: 305).\n12 By not simply delegat-\ning religious and/or spiritual care to actors within the established churches, concepts of palliative care hold everyone liable for caring for patients\u2019 r eli-\ngious and/or spiritual needs and they quite often make room for alternative religious practices and rationalizations. \n  \n2  THE ANTHROPOSOPHICAL  MEDICAL SETTING  \n \nThere is a broad range of academic publications about contemporary anthro-posophic medicine from an insider\u2019s perspective. For example, Kienle et al. (2013) provide a general overview of anthroposophic medicine. In addition, \nthere are more general publications by anthroposophical physicians, nurses, \nand therapists (cp. Bopp/Heine 2008; Fintelmann 2007; Kienle et al. 2006; Girke 2012; Gl\u00f6ckler 2010; Heusser 2011), as well as research articles on different methods of anthroposophic medicine (e.g., on the effectiveness of mistletoe therapy with cancer patients).\n13 Heusser et al. (2006a, 2006b), von \nDach (2001), and von Dach et al. (2009) focus specifically on end-of- life \ncare. For accounts of the history of anthroposophic medicine, its origins and sources from an anthroposophical perspective, in particular the publications of the Ita Wegman Institute and of Peter Selg (2000a; 2000b), the head of the Ita Wegman Institute ( http://www.wegmaninstitut.ch/, July 4, 2018) should \nbe consulted.\n14 There are only a few academic accounts from an outsider\u2019s \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n12  One o utcome of this conceptualization is the official definition of the World \nHealth Organization : \u201cPalliative care is an approach that improves the quality of \nlife of patients and their families facing the problem associated with life -threat-\nening illness, thro ugh the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early \nidentification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other prob-\nlems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual \u201d.(www.who .int/cancer/palliative/  \ndefinition/en, July 4, 2018)  \n13  A list of other English publications is to be found on the webpage of the medical section of the Goetheanum : www.medsektion -goetheanum.org/en/home/books.  \n14  Cp.

Apart from book chapters on the history of anthroposophic med-\nicine (Br\u00fcgge 1984: 101\u2013125; J\u00fctte 1996: 237\u2013261; Ullrich 2011: 158\u2013165, Zander 2007: 1455\u20131578), scholarly discussions lack contemporary research on anthroposophic medicine from an etic point of view, although there are a \nfew exceptions (Arman et al. 2008; Karschuck 2018; Ritchie 2001; \nZeugin/Walthert 2016). To our knowledge, apart from Arman et al. (2008), \nwho conducted qualitative interviews in a Swedish clinic, no qualitative study from a social scientific or Study of Religion perspective has ever been conducted in an anthroposophical hospital.\n15 \nAnthroposophic medicine16 was founded by the physician Ita Wegman \n(1876\u20131943) and Rudolf Steiner (1861\u20131925).17 Even though Steiner had al-\nready shown an interest in medical subjects in the first decades of the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n15  Ritchie (2001) provides a qualitative study of the National Centre for Social Re-\nsearch, an independent social research institution. The study was funded by the \nAnthroposophic Medical Trust and printed by Weleda. In this study, which adopts an etic perspective, the aut hors investigate six practices and one residential unit \nin GB that offer anthroposophic al treatment in addition to general practice. By \nmeans of interviews with patients and medical staff, as well as an analysis of \nmedical records, the authors address the questions of how anthroposophic al treat-\nment is perceived by medical staff working in general practice, how it is organized \nand delivered, and what impact it has on patients in terms of patient responses and clinical effects ( ibid: 4). \n16  The following para graphs are based on emic sources, exemplary monographs that \nfall entirely within the contemporary field of anthroposophic medicine ( cp. \nGl\u00f6ckler  et al.  2011; Girke 2012), and the website of the medical section at the \nSchool of Spiritual Science, Goetheanum , in Dornach, Switzerland \n(www.medsektion -goetheanum.org/home/anthroposophische -medizin , July 4, \n2018). Even though the field of anthroposophic medicine is indeed heterogen e-\nous, these self -portraits should be considered accurate, despite the difference in \nactors.

Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland208 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n twentieth century, the founding date is often located in the early 1920s, a \ndecade that witnessed three events that had a lasting impact on anthropo-sophic medicine. First, Wegman and Steiner held medical courses for medi-cal practitioners in Dornach, Switzerland (the centre of anthroposophy).\n18 \nSecondly, Wegman founded the first anthroposophic hospital in Arlesheim, Switzerland, where medical research has been conducted ever since. Thirdly, in 1925, Wegman published the first monograph on anthroposophic medi-cine, written by herself and Steiner (Steiner/Wegman 1977).\n19 \nAs mentioned above, Steiner and Wegman did not view anthroposophic \nmedicine as being opposed to conventional medicine; rather, they conceptu-\nalized it as being in accordance with academic medical science and thus as \nan extension of conventional medicine, which anthroposophy comple-mented. Therefore, anthroposophic medicine is combined with conventional medical practices, each with their own rationalizations. This is why many anthroposophical medical actors favor the paradigmatic term \u201cintegrative medicine\u201d (Gl\u00f6ckler et al. 2011: 564\u2013567). While Steiner, Wegman, and oth-\ners created new anthroposophical medical practices (e.g., rhythmic massage), \nthey also adapted existing such practices to the medical setting (e.g., eu-rythmy therapy).\n20 Since its beginnings, anthroposophic medicine has cared \nfor the terminally ill, but it was not until recently that the conception of an-throposophical end-of-life care has emerged and received expression (cp. Girke 2012: 1051\u20131083; www.sterben.ch). \nWithin anthroposophic medicine, human beings are viewed as multi-lay-\nered. In his early works, Steiner mainly referred to an anthropology that con-sisted of seven bodies (2010: 19\u201336) and that goes back to theosophy. In the 1920s he started to elaborate an anthropology featuring four bodies (Zander 2007: 1495\u20131497). In this view, the human being consists of a fourfold body, \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n18  https ://www.goetheanum.org/en/, July 4, 2018.  \n19  This publication has now been translated online as \u201cFundamentals of Therapy : \nAn Extension of the Art of Heal ing through Spiritual Knowledge \u201d (cp.  \nhttp://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA027/E nglish/RSP1983/GA027_index.html, \nJuly 4, 2018).  \n20  Even though all these proprietary anthroposophic medical practices were more or \nless informed by anthroposophy, anthroposophy is not their only source. Some \nresearchers, for example, have examined the connection between anthroposop hic \nmedicine and homeopathy ( J\u00fctte 1996 : 237\u2013261; Zander 2007: 1514 \u20131522).   | 209 \n \n the physical body (shape, anatomy, organs, and all the other material as-\npects), the etheric body (the source of life and growth that endows us with thinking skills), the astral body (the carrier of consciousness and feelings), and the I-organization or higher self. The fourth body constitutes the individ-\nuality of the person or his or her spirit, which ultimately transcends li fe (Stei-\nner/Wegman 1977: 7\u201319). This conception of the human being is linked to a \nspecific conception of the afterlife, as the I-organization or higher self will not only outlast death, it will be reincarnated (Steiner 2010: 37 \u201359). \nSteiner\u2019s notion of the four bodies is closely related to the concept of the \nthreefold nature of the human organism that distinguishes the nerve- sense \nsystem, the metabolic-limb system, and the rhythmic system. An anthropo-sophical medical article advocating the need for \u201crhythm studies\u201d (Hilde-\nbrandt 1997) illustrates the close link between the models of the threefold nature and the fourfold (or sevenfold) body, as well as their foundation in religious concepts. In Steiner\u2019s own words:  \n \n\u201cThe rhythmic element in the four bodies [a spects of the human being] was implanted \nin man over long, long periods.... And we would recognize the rhythm of our human \naspects in the movements of the heavenly bodies, which make a complete system.\u201d (20 July 1923, Dornach)  \n \n\u201cOne day man will also apply his own rhythm to the world, when he has reached the \ndivine level.\u201d (21 Dec. 1908, Berlin)21 \n \n \n3  PRACTICE THEORY: MET HODOLOGY, METHODS, \nAND DATA  \n \n3.1  A Practice -Theoretical Approach  \n \nAccording to a practice-theoretical approach, the social is only accessible when it is carried out in action. This is in line with Theodore R. Schatzki\u2019s definition of social practices as a \u201ctemporally unfolding and spatially \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n21  The second quotation by Rudolf Steiner appears in his lecture \u201c\u00dcber den \nRhyt hmus der menschlichen Leiber\u201d, 1988: 158.  Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland210 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n dispersed nexus of doings and sayings. [\u2026] To say that the doings and say-\nings forming a practice constitute a nexus is to say that they are linked in certain ways\u201d  (1996: 89). Thus, social practices are constituted by the per-\nformance of doings and sayings and the existence of a coherent system of \nknowledge about the links between these doings and sayings. Accordingly, \nthey can be heuristically distinguished in terms of a) their use of language and b) their knowledge structures:  \na) Social practices that exhibit a high use of language might be labeled \ndiscursive practices in so far as they \u201c[...] embrace different forms in which the world is meaningfully constructed in language or in other sign- systems\u201d \n(Reckwitz 2002: 254). Social practices do not necessarily have to involve language or other sign systems and might thus be labeled  body practices, or \nnon-discursive practices. However, a closer look at social reality reveals that social practices are only rarely either solely discursive or non-discursive. Ra-ther, they exhibit a greater or lesser orientation towards language or the body, being either more communication/language- (and less body-) oriented or \nmore body- (and less communication/language-) oriented. \nb) Social practices often build on the ability of actors to rationalize their \nactions reflexively. What Giddens calls the rationalization of action means \nthat \u201cactors\u2014also routinely and for the most part without fuss\u2014maintain a \ncontinuing \u2018theoretical understanding\u2019 of the grounds of their activity\u201d (1984: 5). This form of knowledge is the most common one, yet it is often \nnot \u201cdirectly accessible to the consciousness of actors\u201d (Giddens 1984: 4). \nAlthough, as social scientists, we examine this knowledge either through ob-servation or by explicitly enquiring about it, the implicit motivation of action is not discursively accessible (Giddens 1984: 6, but constitutes the \u201cimplicit sense of what someone actually wants\u201d (Reckwitz 2003: 293). \n \n3.2  Data and Data Collection  \n Adopting a practice-theoretical view of anthroposophic medicine has an im-pact on one\u2019s methodological approach: this qualitative study first looked at what is happening on the ground and then asked the actors to rationalize their  | 211 \n \n doings and sayings discursively.22 Accordingly, this study combined the \nqualitative research methods of participant observation23 and qualitative in-\nterviews.24 Given that our main interest was in anthroposophic end-of- life \ncare, the fieldwork focused on those hospital units that exhibited dying and \ndeath as crucial features, namely an oncological ambulatory and an oncology \nward.  \nZeugin actively participated in the field by means of a nursing internship \nand the job-shadowing of physicians, nurses, and therapists alike. This pro-vided valuable insights into what happens behind closed doors (e.g., consul-tations between physicians and patients, appointments with therapists, an-\nthroposophical medical treatments). Apart from participant observation, she \nblended in by experiencing certain anthroposophical medical practices her-\nself, such as art therapy, rhythmic massage, poultices, and therapeutic eu-rythmy.\n25 In addition, she conducted 25 interviews of an average duration of \none hour with health professionals (nurses, physicians, therapists, social workers), pastors, and terminally ill and dying patients. Finally, she collected \ngrey literature, online information, and internal documents. \n \n3.3  An Anthroposophical Medical Hospital\n26 \n \nThe anthroposophical hospital in which the fieldwork was conducted opened \nin the 1990s as a private clinic primarily providing anthroposophical medical \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n22  Even though, following Bourdieu (2005 : 18\u201319), this is legitimate, we have to \npay attention to the fact that such rationalizations \u2014concepts, beliefs and values \u2014\nand their verbal manifestations in discourses might  not occur if it were not for us.  \n23  Apart from general guidelines about participant observation (cp. Spradley 1980; \nEmerson  et al. 2001; Franke/ Maske 2011), Zeugin considered the term \u201cfocused \nethnography\u201d coined by Hubert Knoblauch (2001, 2002, 2005) to be an important \nreference point.  \n24  In order to enhance the comparability of all the interviews, Zeugin designed a \nqualitative interview technique that combines elements of narrative interviews as \nconceived by Fritz Sch\u00fctze (1983) and elements of problem -centered interviews \nsuggested by Andreas Witzel (1985, 2000).  \n25  For a similar approach , cp. Langford 2002.  \n26  The following description is primarily based on the hospital\u2019s discursive self -por-\ntrayal in grey literature and on their website.  Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland212 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n treatment. In the late 1990s, the hospital was entered on the official list of \nhospitals, and since then it has been authorized and required to conduct pri-mary health care, as well as emergency medical aid, like any other public health facility. Whereas its conventional medical treatment has always been \ncovered by obligatory health insurance, formerly many anthroposophical \nmedical treatments had to be financed by the patients themselves or by sup-plementary insurance. Only very recently, and as a result of the official recognition of anthroposophic medicine in 2009, has the hospital managed to introduce a lump-sum payment for anthroposophical treatments on a case-by-case basis.\n27 Since then, the costs of anthroposophical medical practices \nhave been covered by basic health insurance, provided that they are pre-scribed  by a physician and are carried out for a patient on this financial basis. \nA support association funded by donations and guided by members of the \nAnthroposophical Society bears some of the additional expenses associated with the hospital\u2019s orientation towards anthroposophic medicine from day one. For example, the support association pays for the employment of an \nanthroposophical nursing expert, who is responsible for training nurses in \nanthroposophical nursing, as they usually only have conventional training. \n \n \n4  ANTHROPOSOPHICAL END -OF-LIFE CARE  \n \nAs end-of-life care embraces more than just one\u2019s death bed, it is conducted at various stages of both conventional (Jonen-Thielemann 2012: 989\u2013997\n) \nand anthroposophical end-of- life care. Corresponding to the anthroposophi-\ncal concept of the end of life and to practice in the respective hospital, the following stages also cover the time after the death of the respective patient. The following description presents data from Zeugin\u2019s fieldwork in 2015. \n \n4.1  Late Stag e \n \nAt this time, most terminally ill patients are not permanently hospitalized, \nbut are given outpatient treatment. Most conventional and anthroposophical \ncurative treatments are reduced, and the provision of anthroposophical \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n27  Cp. http://apps.swissdrg.org/manual40/drgs/54771e6ce4b0887aa13fd25c?locale  \n=de, June 4, 2018.   | 213 \n \n medical treatment shifts away from oncological practices to relieving anthro-\nposophical medical, nursing, and therapeutic practices. \nSome of the body-oriented practices stay the same throughout all stages, \nbut others are reduced,28 and some vary over time and are attributed with \ndifferent meanings, such as body wash care. No matter whether body-ori-ented practices lost importance or were continued, all options were usually rationalized by referring to anthroposophical concepts. \nIn reducing body-oriented practices, the argument was mostly based on \nthe belief that too much touching prevents patients from \u201cletting go\u201d and ac-cordingly from dying. This is expressed in the following quote from a rhyth-\nmic massage therapist:  \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve often experienced that patients who always loved rhythmic massage and who \nwanted to have it every day got to the point where every single touch was too much. And they say: No, I don\u2019t want that anymore. And mostly, this happens right before \nthey really cross the threshold. Maybe because everything that is forced on the p hys-\nical body from the outside reconnects them to it. That there is this feeling of letting \ngo of their physical body.\u201d ( Heike, rhythmic massage therapist, 8 June 2015)\n29 \n \nThe remaining body-oriented practices were often explicitly rationalized us-\ning anthroposophical concepts, again with the importance of \u201cletting go\u201d. \nThe conception of letting go is found in Girke (2012: 1053), one of the very \nfew accounts of end-of-life care written from an anthroposophical point of view. In this work, \u201cletting go\u201d is strongly linked to an alternative religious conception of the human being, as Girke refers to the fourfold articulation of \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n28  According to the observations of L\u00fcddeckens during her fieldwork in a conven-\ntional medical palliative care unit, the reduction  in body -oriented practices is not \nspecific  to the anthroposophic al setting : in conventional palliative care wards \nbody- oriented p ractices, such as hygienic measures, also lose importance.  \n29  Original wording : \u201cIch hab noch oft erlebt, dass [...] Klienten, die es (rhythmic \nmassage, BZ) immer geLIEBT haben und die JEden Tag gerne das wollten, dass es einen Punkt gibt, wo (.) jenste Ber\u00fchrung wie ihnen zu viel ist.

For example:  \n \n\u201cIn death, the I, the astral and the etheric body detach from the physical organization. \n[\u2026] A [\u2026] manner of crossing a threshold between life and death concerns the con-\nsciousness and hence the nerve -sense system. Patients grow increasingly tired, which \nis associated with the separati on of the fourfold body throughout the dying process.\u201d \n(Girke 2012: 1054, 1058)30 \n \nThis anthroposophical perception of \u201cletting go\u201d, first of the patients\u2019 physi-\ncal body at the time of death, then of their etheric body during the following \n72 hours, and finally after this time of their astral body, was also found in the hospital in this case study:  \n \n\u201cIn anthroposophy, there is the crossing of a threshold and afterwards the (transcend-\nent) bodies let go of each other. [...] And after three days all that remai ns is the [...] \ncorpse, right? And all the other bodies step by step let go of this physicality.\u201d (Lothar, \nphysician, 30 April 2015)31 \n \nOne example of this rationalization of a body-oriented practice is the convic-\ntion that certain directed ways of touching support patients in \u201cletting go:\u201d  \n \nWe often perform the so -called pentagram embrocation. They really address the hu-\nman being as a whole, in his or her individuality. And they strongly lead the person \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n30  Original wording : \u201cIm Tod verlassen das Ich, der astralische und der \u00c4therleib \ndie physische Organisation. \u201d (Girke 2012 : 1054) \u201cEine [...] Form des \u00dcberschrei-\ntens der Schwelle betrifft das Bewusstsein und das Nerven -Sinnes -System.

[\u2026] I t calms and supports letting go.\u201d (Manuela, nurse, 22 May 2015)33 \n \nIn this view, the process of \u201cletting go\u201d is facilitated by nurses acting calmly \nand silently, and deliberately touching, thus performing body care in a certain way. \nFrom an anthroposophical perspective, one aspect of the person will \ntranscend death.  This aspect is referred to most often as the soul, the spiritual dimension, or the I, as anthroposophists would say, and just as frequently it \nis linked to the idea of reincarnation. The notion of \u201cletting go\u201d is also found \nin conventional medical palliative care contexts as one of its own core se-mantics. However, here it is merely a matter of the patient\u2019s need to let go of life: \u201cAs death nears, many people feel a lessening of their desire to live longer.\u201d\n34 In the anthroposophical context, in contrast, \u201cletting go\u201d is clearly \nlinked to conceptions of human beings and the afterlife.  \nAt this stage, discursive practices that actively involve the patients are \nreduced, whereas discursive practices among the health professionals them-selves increase slightly, rationalizing the body-oriented practices, as we will see in the following examples. An important discursive practice is the nurs-ing case discussions, which are held weekly, last thirty minutes, and occur \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n32  \u201cWir [...] machen dann m anchmal auch die sogenannten [...] Pentagramm -Einrei-\nbungen.

Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland216 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n under the premise that internal and oncology nurses are physically copresent. \nAdditionally, the performance of this social practice builds on formal guide-lines aimed primarily at the rationalization of action by producing a theoret-ical description of the fourfold articulation of the body. At the same time, \nthese guidelines offer instructions for action by referring to the nurses\u2019 expe-\nriences of work and providing a list with features of each element of the four-fold body that guides them in their observations and their treatment of the patients. In preparation for the discussion of each case, one of the nurses is asked to fill in a table with her observations. The performance of the nursing case discussion is the anthroposophical nursing expert\u2019s responsibility, \nwhereas the presenting nurse varies each time. In Zeugin\u2019s observations, the \ndiscussion unfolds as follows. While all the nurses sit in the nurses\u2019 station, one nurse describes a patient who is being somewhat \u201cproblematic\u201d by using a guideline table of the fourfold bodies as a template for her presentation. In this table, the four bodies are adapted to the medical setting: the physical body is linked to visible, easily determinable aspects such as age, gender, and \nsymptoms; the etheric body carries information about respiration, body heat, \nnutrition, and expulsion, as well as creativity, habits, and everyday rhythms; the astral body is to be found in the patient\u2019s experience and communication of pain and mood, as well as thinking, feeling, and wanting; and the last body, the ego or \u201cI\u201d of the human being, is exemplified as a patient\u2019s profession, all sorts of biographical information, and indications of self-awareness, e.g., \nregarding the finiteness of his or her being. After this presentation, the other \nnurses add their own observations. Finally, possible nursing interventions are discussed by making use of a conception of anthroposophical nursing called the \u201ctwelve gestures of care\u201d in nursing.\n35 The twelve gestures, such as \nH\u00fcllen/or \u201cgrounding\u201d and Harmonisieren or \u201charmonizing,\u201d are different objectives that can be achieved by several different nursing practices. In the \ncase of a female who refused to eat in accordance with the results of her \nmeasuring each food item with a pendulum, the interventions included the following: sending in the (anthroposophist) nutritionist to discuss a balanc ed \ndiet; the affection and love of nurses spending time with her; and a footbath \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n35  This conception was developed by Rolf Heine on the basis of Stein er\u2019s belief in \nthe twelve \u201csenses\u201d ( cp. www.vfap.de/anthroposophische -pflege , July 4, 2018 ). \nThe last sense, the \u201cIch -Sinn,\u201d is based on the ego of the fourfold body concept; \ncp. von Dach 2008.   | 217 \n \n in water containing rosemary in order to \u201cground her\u201d because she seems too \n\u201cspiritually minded\u201d: \u201cShe is so spiritually minded. [\u2026] She aspires to over-come her trauma so as to not have to go through it again in her next incarna-tion\u201d (Nadja, nurse, 18 May 2015).\n36 \nAnother discursive practice is the inter-professional biographical work37 \ncase discussion. Biographical work constitutes a crucial part of anthropo-sophic medicine, as of end-of-life care. According to the biographical coun-sellor, she first conducts a conversation with a patient to learn about his or her life story. This conversation follows the pattern of seven-year cycles as-cribed to Rudolf Steiner. This pattern is again used throughout the biograph-\nical work-case discussion, as in the case of a 55- year-old woman with leu-\nkaemia. In this case, biographical work discussions brought together the at-\ntending physician, the key nurse, a physiotherapist, and a social worker, as well as representatives of all anthroposophical therapies. To begin with, they shared their initial impressions of the patient\u2019s current state. The physician said that she had recently delivered some computer tomography results and \nthat the patient didn\u2019t behave normally: \u201cShe hugged me. I don\u2019t like that, \nbut I didn\u2019t say anything. I think she is really longing for closeness\u201d (Elisa-beth, physician, 22 April 2015). The nurse adds that the patient seems very sensitive: \u201cShe reacted strongly to physical contact when I applied a rhyth-mic embrocation; it really exposed her emotions so strongly that I had to give her some tranquilizer\u201d (Nora, nurse, 22 April 2015). Afterwards, the bio-\ngraphical counsellor retold the woman\u2019s life story in accordance with the \npattern of seven-year cycles. Finally, the health professionals discussed what they had been listening to and concluded that the patient clearly lacked a basic sense of trust in her first seven years and that she had always cared more for others than for herself. From this the physician deduced the follow-ing need for action: \u201cAnthroposophically speaking, her higher self needs \nshelter, warmth and protection. [\u2026] I\u2019d recommend some nice warm poul-\ntices\u201d (Elisabeth, physician, 22 April 2015). \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n36  Original wording : \u201cSie ist so vergeistigt. [\u2026] Sie strebt an, ihr Trauma zu bew\u00e4l-\ntigen, damit sie das los ist und das nicht noch einmal machen muss, wenn sie \ninkarniert wird. \u201d \n37  \u201cBiographical work \u201d is an anthroposophic al extension of conventional psychol-\nogy complemented by the anthroposophic al theory of reincarnation and anthro-\nposophical  anthropology ; cp. Ritchie 2001 : 78ff.; Burkhard 2002.  Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland218 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n In both examples, body-practices involving the patient, such as a footbath \nand poultices, are the consequence of a discursive practice among health-\ncare professionals.38  \n \n4.2  Final Stage  \n \nOn the physical plane, the body starts shutting down and curative medical treatments become completely irrelevant. Even though the physicians are still engaged in both conventional and anthroposophical medical care, they \nwithdraw from the sickbed, leaving nurses to be more present. Once a cure \nis definitely no longer an option and discursive abilities decline, body-ori-ented practices gain more and more momentum , such as rhythmic massage. \nAccording to Margarethe Hauschka (1978), who was an assistant to \nWegman, the founder of rhythmic massage, this form of massage combines Swedish massage techniques with anthroposophical spiritual science. An-\nthroposophical anthropology and the conception of the threefold nature of \nthe human organism (nerve-sense system, metabolic-limb system, rhythmic system) are the main official rationalizations of this formalized set of prac-tices (cp. Hauschka 1978: 92\u2013100; see also above). Rhythmic massage, as its name suggests, is primarily aimed at the rhythmic system. \n \nWhereas different practices of rhythmic massage are performed at sev-\neral stages, the so-called embrocation is of great significance when it comes \nto patients who are very close to death.39 In her fieldwork, Zeugin found that \nthe pentagram embrocation is embedded in a wider scope of action. The fol-lowing account is based on her own experience of a rhythmic massage ther-apist carrying out pentagram embrocation on her for illustrative purposes. While sitting on the massage table, the therapist explained that pentagram \nembrocation requires a subsequent rest of about twenty minutes to produce \nits effect fully. She further explained that this effect consists in bringing all parts of the body back together and making the patient \u201cwhole\u201d again. The massage therapist fetched a piece of paper and, while drawing a pentagram, she continued her explanation as follows. The embrocation stems from \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n38  In the second case , however, the discussion among the healthcare professionals \nwas preceded by a biographical con versation with the patient.  \n39  Cp. v on Dach (2001) , Pflege an der Grenze des Seins, pp. 36 f.; also Layer 2006 : \n110- 116.  | 219 \n \n Leonardo, but thanks to anthroposophy this picture was assigned to the \netheric body, where the energy flow is positioned. As rhythmic massage op-erates at this level, blocked energy can be set free by indicating five essential points. According to what she had said in a previous interview, she aims to \nbring all the bodies together by pointing to these five positions on the physi-\ncal body in the correct sequence. After the treatment, she started a conversa-tion that led from the illnesses of the etheric body to the Tibetan Book of the Dead.  \nWith regard to this therapeutic practice, a conventional medical rational-\nization of action is missing altogether: there is no reference to the relief of \npain or any other distressing symptom, as required by the definition of palli-\native care, but it is primarily aimed at the patient letting go of her body and life in order to prepare for the afterlife.\n40 The link to the \u201cTibetan Book of \nthe Dead\u201d, a book that is widely popular for its content about support for th e \nsouls in the process of dying and their transition to the afterlife, even strengthened this aim. \nThis rationalization of action, i.e. letting go of the body and preparation \nfor an afterlife, is part of the discursive knowledge of all health professionals in the hospital of Zeugin's fieldwork.\n41 It comes into effect in the communi-\ncation with the particular patient, provided that the latter can still be ad-dressed and is conscious. Otherwise this body-oriented practice can be per-formed without any use of language. \n \n4.3  Terminal Stage  \n Due to the increasing loss of agency that develops in the terminal stage, an-throposophical physicians and therapists noticeably back away from the \ndeath bed, leaving it mainly to the nurses to provide all sorts of primary and \nend-of- life care. Nurses now become more autonomous and independent \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n40  See the \u201cTherapeutic Rational \u201d of massages with regard to the findings in the \nstudy of Ritchie: \u201c Through achieving balance in physic al functions, the therapist \nis able to influence and connect with the other higher  levels to promote greater \nbalance and connection between them. Massage mainly works through the phys-ical and etheric (or life forces) level which can then strengthen the s oul (emo-\ntional) and spiritual levels (ego organisation) \u201d (2001: 72).  \n41  For the Lucas Clinik in Arlesheim (CH), cp. von Dach 2001 : 36 f. \u2018 \u2019Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland220 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n from the physicians\u2019 instructions and surveillance. Often, they perform self-\ndirected \u201clittle somethings\u201d, as one of the nurses explained:  \n \n\u201cFor me, the anthroposophical aspects just go wit h caring for the terminally ill. [\u2026] \nNot pampering them, but to giv e them a little treat \u2014in another way.\u201d (Larissa, nurse, \n26 March 2015)42 \n \nA prevalent and thus almost institutionalized instance of little somethings is the social practice of installing a rose-quartz lamp in patients\u2019 rooms. The lamps are not installed until the patient\u2019s death is foreseeable, yet from then \nonward they are lit permanently. While some nurses simply highlight the \npractice\u2019s aesthetic value, others argue that it supports the patient in letting go by providing a nice, warm, quiet ambience. \nFurthermore, nurses increasingly relocate their doings and sayings to-\nwards a set of practices that are often referred to as \u201cbeing with\u201d when the dying process progresses.\n43 Practices of \u201cbeing with\u201d are carried out so as to \nstill be doing something, even though medically nothing can be done any-more. \u201cBeing with\u201d comprises a multitude of practices, such as sitting at the patient\u2019s bedside, decorating his or her room, singing a song, narrating a story, holding the dying person\u2019s hand, and so on. Even family members are instructed just \u201cto be with\u201d their dying relatives in order\u2014 at least this is how \nthe saying goes\u2014to facilitate the process of letting go and thus promote dy-\ning. Hence, \u201cbeing with\u201d is strongly linked to conceptions of a good death, \nthe human being, and the afterlife in the form of the metaphor of letting go. \nDuring the terminal stage, practices and their rationalizations are even \nmore detached: the latter are not discursively communicated in contact with the patients, but only in interprofessional conversations or in exchanges with the researcher.  \n  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n42  Original wording : \u201cUnd f\u00fcr mich gh\u00f6rt das Anthroposophische d\u00e4nn eifach au \ndezue. [...] N\u00f6d verh\u00e4tschl\u00e4, aber (.) \u00e4h m (1) eifach nomal \u00f6ppis chlises Guets tue, \nuf \u00e4n anderi Wiis. \u201d \n43  Cp. Zeugin /Walthert 2016.   | 221 \n \n 4.4  After Death  \n \nOnce a patient has died, there is still work for the physicians and nurses to \ndo until the state funeral office takes over. After a physician has issued a \ndeath certificate, the nurses are in charge of most post-mortem care practices, that is, going through the formalities, dealing with family members, and burning incense in the patient\u2019s room. It is common practice to let the de-ceased patients rest for some hours before preparing them for the laying out. Usually one nurse prepares the deceased without the bereaved being present \nand performs individual actions like closing the deceased\u2019s eyes and washing \nand clothing him or her quietly without moving the body unnecessarily. The latter aspect accords with two differing rationalizations of action, one saying that things are done like this out of sheer respect, the other that the souls need to let go of their bodies and thus need quiet.\n44 \nThe deceased are laid out in the in-house mortuary for three days. This \ntemporal determination is in line with Rudolf Steiner\u2019s conception of a pan-orama of the past life that follows death and lasts around two to three days. Whereas the physical body leaves the person at the time of death, the etheric body splits off during this subsequent period (Steiner 2001: 140).  \n \n\u201cThere is a period of rest, and in it, the bodies [\u2026] let go of their physicality. I believe \nwe overestimate ourselves if we beli eve we have a great impact on this process of \nletting go. It is connected, is connected to the person\u2019s biography, right? [\u2026] Well, I \nbelieve there is this frame, and we do not strictly lay out the deceased\u2019s body for three \ndays, but if possible.\u201d ( Lothar,  physician, 30 April 2015)45 \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n44  Both kinds of rationalizations can be found in conventional palliative care con-texts as well. However, in most cases , the deceased are prepared for their \u201cdepa r-\nture\u201d within short time of their death and incense is only burnt if a staff member \nchooses to do so as an individual . \n45  Original wording : \u201cEs gibt eine bestimmte Ruhephase, (.) in der (.) diese Leib-\nlichkeit (.) sich [...] l\u00f6sen kann.

However, whereas he considers this action as supporting the process of letting go, to him it is \nnot necessarily a precondition.\n46 This stance is in line with actual practice in \nthe hospital, which is also influenced by economic and other practical con-\nsiderations resulting from its designation as a public hospital: whereas laying out the body for three days is the usual practice, the duration may be reduced, or it may not take place at all when there are more deceased than rooms for laying out, or when the deceased or his relatives do not approve of it. How-\never, if possible the practice is performed in its original form.  \nIn addition, all health professionals are invited to participate in a collec-\ntive farewell ritual that is primarily targeted at the health professionals them-\nselves, though the deceased\u2019s family is invited too. The deceased is laid out in the middle of the small room, specifically reserved for this purpose. The room is decorated with candles and flowers, and the attendees surround the \ncoffin. The actual farewell ritual starts with a gong being sounded, and two \ntunes are chosen and performed by the health professionals.\n47 After the sing-\ning, the physician provides the deceased\u2019s biography, focusing on the de-scription and interpretation of his or her dying process and the health profes-sionals\u2019 share in it. Depending on the physician\u2019s personal assessment of the religiousness of the deceased, he may say the Lord\u2019s Prayer. The ending of \nthe ceremony is again marked by the same songs. This stage, where the med-\nical staff are still involved, is marked by religious ritualistic practices and other discursive practices, all of them in line with anthroposophical rational-izations. \nDuring the successive stages of anthroposophical end-of-life care, from \nthe late stage till the terminal stage, body-oriented practices in relation to \ndiscursive practices in contact with the patient gain momentum. However, \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n46  He pointed out that the separation of the four bodies also takes place when people \ndie a painful death and cannot be laid out, for example , when they are buried alive \nin an earthquake.  \n47  The first canon, \u201cDona Nobis Pacem \u201d (\u201cGive us peace \u201d), originates from the last \nwords of the Roman Catholic mass of Agnus Dei; the second tune, \u201cHarmonie der \nSterne \u201d (\u201cHarmony of the stars \u201d), by the German songwriter Werner Gneist, ex-\nplicitly concerns God, cre ation , and the meaning of life.   | 223 \n \n death seems to be the turning point, where body-oriented practices with re-\ngard to the deceased patient are reduced decisively, while discursive prac-tices with anthroposophical rationalizations among the healthcare profes-sionals become central. At this stage, the difference between anthroposophic \ncare as including care for the deceased and conventional medical care which \nends when the patient has passed away is most obvious. \n  \n5  R ELIGIOUS RATIONALIZA TION IN  \nEND -OF-LIFE CARE   \n As the description above indicates, it is a distinctive feature of anthropo-sophic medicine that it provides religious rationalizations that enable healthcare professionals to maintain their agency even if medical rationali-\nzations do not support further actions. \nIn conventional palliative care, less and less action is carried out over the \ncourse of the dying process.\n48 This is due to the fact that many conventional \nmedical practices are no longer of effect and communication becomes more \ndifficult, with patients losing their communication skills or their conscious-ness. However, in the case of the anthroposophical medical care in our case \nstudy, health professionals continue providing care by focusing their action \non more body-oriented practices, as we have seen above. \nWhile some more communication-oriented medical practices, such as \npsychotherapeutic interventions (\u201cbiographical work\u201d), end completely, oth-ers vary over time and become more body-oriented: eurythmy therapy,\n49 for \nexample, becomes more passive and has fewer communicative instructions \nas death approaches, as patients are not required to engage in physical activ-\nities by themselves anymore; rather, the eurythmy therapist conducts the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n48  Cp. Zeugin/ Walthert (2016) for an account of the relocation of action against the \nbackdrop of hospice end -of-life care.  \n49  Eurythmy is an anthroposophic al expressive art and movement therapy. \u201cThe \ntherapeutic rationale \u201d of eurythmy therapy appears in the findings of Ritchie as \nfollows: \u201c As with all treatments, the overall therapeutic rationale and subsequent \nprocesses are very much dependent on the individual patient and relate to a key \nprinciple of developing the potenti al of the person \u201d (2001: 76). Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland224 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n physical activities for them either by moving the patient\u2019s body parts or by \ntaking over the exercise completely and performing it herself. \nBy means of such non-discursive practices, the health professionals re-\nclaim agency, which seems to decline increasingly in the face of death. Even \nwhen it appears that nothing can be done anymore because the patient is go-\ning to die anyway, this allows health professionals to still do something for their patients and not just stand by idly. \nA typical rationalization of eurhythmy therapy is as follows: \u201cUncon-\nsciously experienced states of restlessness decrease and give way to a peace-ful state of mind. All these are important means in order to commit oneself \nto the next steps and the new spiritual space connected to death.\n\u201d50  \nEmphasis on these body-oriented practices is backed up by way of ra-\ntionalization based on an anthroposophical understanding of the dying pro-\ncess. With regard to the various activities in the different stages mentioned above, the healthcare professionals often refer to explanations pertaining to anthroposophical concepts such as the pattern of the seven-year cycles, the \nfourfold body, and the departure and reincarnation of the soul. \nIn these explanations, particular emphasis is placed on the notion of \u201clet-\nting go\u201d: Throughout the dying process, people have to let go not only of \ntheir lives, but of their bodies too. This notion is used to rationalize the body care, rhythmic massage, the \u201clittle somethings\u201d such as the rose quartz lamp, and even the effort to avoid moving the body immediately after death. This \nkind of religious rationalization enables health professionals to continue \nproviding care without focusing their actions on healing and without restrict-ing their focus on the physical existence of their patients. Instead, the idea of easing the separation of the bodies and the soul\u2019s transition into the afterlife gains importance. As already noted, this relates to a specific conception of human beings and the afterlife, as well as showing that the health profession-\nals in the anthroposophical hospital feel accountable for this kind of religious \nor spiritual care. It is this rationalization of action that distinguishes the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n50  http://www.sterben. ch/Heileurythmie.81.0.html, February 7, 2018.

Therefore, in this setting, where religion and \nmedicine intersect, reference to the religious dimension provides a funda-\nmental basis for how therapeutic practices are rationalized. \nThese examples illustrate the ways in which actors in anthroposophic \nend-of- life care, unlike those in conventional medicine, act according to the \nrules not only of the medical field but also of the alternative religious field of anthroposophy, showing how they gain agency by means of this double \norientation. \nThe body-oriented practices, like the poultices and the footbath in the \nexamples given above, are in most cases conducted because of instructions \nfrom the interprofessional nursing case and biographical work discussions. In most cases, the nurses did not rationalize these practices with anthropo-sophical concepts in contact with the patients. The first patient will probably \nnever know that she was given a footbath so as to \u201cbe grounded\u201d as a sup-\nportive measure with regard to her future reincarnation, any more than the second patient will know that the poultices will protect her \u201chigher self\u201d. In the stages in which the discursive practices are reduced there is consequently less communication about religion. However, religion is practiced by means of footbaths, poultices, the ways of performing body care, and so on. \n \n \n6  POWER STRU GGLES  \n According to Bourdieu, fields are internally structured by actors\u2019 struggles \nfor power.\n51 The valid set of rules of acting and of the distribution of power \nare the main bones of contention between leading actors who hold a monop-\noly of power and novices or oppressed actors who are trying to gain power (Bourdieu 2014: 107). In the case of end-of- life care in our case study, the \nrules of both conventional and anthroposophic medicine are at stake. There are practices based on conventional medical dispositions and others based on \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n51  For a short but concise explanation of Bourdieu s conceptualization of field, (sym-\nbolic) power , and forms of capital as manifest in habitus, material goods , and \ninstitutionalized forms, see Rageth this volume.  \u2019Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland226 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n anthroposophical dispositions and situations where struggles over the valid-\nity of different sets of rules occur. The actors involved embody a conven-tional medical habitus and an anthroposophical habitus to different degrees. Moreover, they have different degrees of symbolic power with regard to their \nanthroposophical expertise and institutional status. \nThus, the question of how, under these specific circumstances, the re-\nspective power struggles can be understood arises .\n52 Most of the actors\u2019 \nstruggles over power have to do with the fact that the actors orient themselves \nto the set of rules of more than one social field. While all actors play by the main set of rules of anthroposophical end-of-life care, they relate differently \nto conventional medicine and anthroposophy respectively. Even though in \nour case the anthroposophical medical treatment is provided by physicians, nurses, and therapists alike, a nurse who mainly refers to the conventional medical set of rules is likely to perform fewer anthroposophical medical prac-tices and to rationalize them in a less anthroposophical manner than a nurse who relates more to anthroposophy, such as the anthroposophical nursing \nexpert. \nAll nurses are trained in conventional medical nursing, yet, apart from \nthe in-house training, they have hardly any education in anthroposophical \nnursing. Accordingly, they are most likely to relate to the set of rules for conventional medicine in cases where the two fields are in conflict. \nIn contrast to the nurses, the physicians all have a general interest in \nCAM, and more than half of those who engage in end-of- life care have de-\ngrees in anthroposophic medicine in addition to their conventional medical education. The nurses and physicians who have this kind of double training occupy powerful positions within their own occupational groups, as well as throughout the hospital. For example, all attending physicians on the hospital management board are trained in anthroposophic medicine and are well-\nknown practitioners of it. Therapists, finally, are greatly involved in acting \non anthroposophical principles, as they have all been trained by an anthropo-sophical institution and are also likely to relate to anthroposophy, \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n52  As Bourdieu explains : \u201cThe struggles which take place within the field are about \nthe monopoly of the legitimate authority (specific authority) which is character-\nistic of the field in question, which means,  ultimately, the conservation of the \nstructure of the distribution of the specific capital \u201d (1995: 73).  | 227 \n \n irrespective of their professional engagement in the medical setting.53 Physi-\ncians, therapists, and the anthroposophical nursing expert, socialized within \nthe anthroposophical field, consequently tend to act in a respective habitus and prefer anthroposophical practices in cases of conflict. \nThe continuing power struggle of the actors involved in the practice of \nanthroposophical end-of- life care may be illustrated by attempts made by the \nanthroposophical nursing expert to control the doings and sayings of nurses in caring for the terminally ill and dying. By means of the nursing case dis-cussions, the anthroposophical nursing expert tried to impose a collective nursing habitus by directing it towards the anthroposophical set of rules. That \nshe was allowed to do this reflects the fact that she was accorded greater \npower than the regular nurses. This further demonstrates that the hospital\u2019s management and the supporting foundation\u2014leading actors\u2014who have not assigned a conventional medical nurse to administer further training are up-holding the anthroposophical set of rules in doing so. \nHowever, the nursing expert\u2019s influence on the nurses remains limited in \nso far as in most cases the nurses do not transfer the anthroposophical dispo-sitions taught in the actual case discussions to other cases. Furthermore, it must be noted that the practice of the nurses is informed by anthroposophical dispositions only when they consider it not to be in conflict with conventional medical practice, despite the instructions of the anthroposophical nursing ex-pert. This way of acting is in line with Bourdieu, who argues that the inten-\ntional communication and teaching of any habitus is exceptional and bound \nto fail (1997: 165\u2013169). The reasons for this are twofold. First, the incorpo-ration of objective structures involves a lengthy process of implicit learning, which for most nurses took place in the realm of conventional nursing, not in anthroposophical care. Secondly, those forms of habitus are the most ef-fective that are not informed by intention. Due to their socialization within \nconventional nursing, the nurses implicitly acquired learning about certain \nnorms that led to certain dispositions with regard to practices. In contrast to this implicit learning, the intentional teaching of the nursing expert is less influential in conflict situations, as the crucial example below will demon-strate.  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n53  A last group of actors are the terminally ill and dying patients themselves. Due to \nthe article\u2019s terms of reference, however, they will not  be dealt  with specifically \nhere.  Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland228 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n The practice of administering pain-killers and sedatives at the end of life \nposes a problem for anthroposophical end-of- life care. While many nurses \nopenly argued in favor of this practice, anthroposophical physicians tended \nto be reluctant to follow it, while the hospital management did not participate \nin any explicit discourse on the matter. One important rationalization for the \nphysicians\u2019 reluctance is the emphasis on the patient having a clear mind so as to have an opportunity for transformation and inner growth and to be able to extract experience until the very end, which is gainful for the afterlife.\n54 \nTherefore, as patients should be able to experience this transitional period consciously, anthroposophical medical care tries to avoid the use of sedating \npainkillers: \u201cThe aim is to pass away with the least required pain medication \nand a mind as conscious as possible\u201d (Lothar, physician, 30 April 2015).\n55 In \nthis context, it important to realize tha t the anthroposophical physicians \nshared the anthroposophical view that dying is not something to be prevented at all costs and that death is not dreadful. On the contrary, the time of death appears as a significant and wonderful moment in an anthroposophical view \n(Steiner 1980: 327\u2013328). Another rationalization articulated in the hospital \nwhere Zeugin's fieldwork was conducted consisted in the conviction that the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n54  This rationalization , expressed  by the physicians in our case study , is in accord-\nance with anthroposophic  medical theory. Cp. Floriani 2016: 99 \u2013100; Girke 2012 : \n1062\u2013 1064, Gl\u00f6ckler 2008 : 471\u2013 472; Karschuck 2018: 136 \u2013144. \n55  Original wording: \u201cAlso das Ziel ist schon, [...] mit m\u00f6glichst wenig (.) \nSCHMERzmittel bei m\u00f6glichst grossem Bewusstsein diesen Schritt zu gehen.\u201d \nThe same physician explained further that many patients appreciated a state of \npainlessness: \u201cIt is as if their  pain is receding and their spiritual life gains free-\ndom\u201d (Lothar, physician, 30.4.2015); original wording: \u201cDer Schmerz tritt wie in den HINtergrund [Ja] und damit ist mein Geistesleben eigentlich freier\u201d . The goal \nto administer as few painkillers as poss ible is in accordance with von Dach 2001 : \n34\u201337. Floriani (2016) refers to Bott (1996 ) here: \u201c According to the anthropo-\nsophic approach, humans are on a path of spiritual evolution, wherein disease can play a central role in their terrestrial fates as part of a process of transformation and inner cures, with particular transformative power during the process of dying. In other words, disease is unde rstood as means of transformati on and spiritual \ndevelopment \u201d (ibid: 99\u2013100). For anthroposophical concepts , cp. Girke 2010 ; \n2012: 426, 1052\u2013 3.   | 229 \n \n dying need fewer painkillers in order to ease their pain, as they are already \nletting go of their bodies during the dying process.56 \nNurses, on the other hand, mostly preferred to administer pain-killers and \nsedatives and used conventional medical rationalizations in doing so, con-\ncentrating on the physical needs and psychological conditions of their pa-\ntients. By emphasizing their greater presence at the dying patients\u2019 sick-beds, they claimed to know their patients\u2019 wishes and needs, leading them to argue for the benefits of the conventional medical treatment of administering pain-killers and sedatives.  \nThe anthroposophical physicians were powerful actors within this an-\nthroposophical hospital because they acquired more symbolic power than other health professionals: they were officially in charge of implementing anthroposophy in the hospital, and they had both conventional and anthropo-sophical medical degrees and titles that equipped them with institutionalized cultural capital (cp. Bourdieu 1986). The nurses, by contrast, had less insti-tutionalized capital and symbolic power than the physicians who administer \nand supervise their actions. From their positions of symbolic power, the latter \ntried to control the practice of anthroposophical end-of-life care by rational-izing it in an anthroposophical manner.  \nHowever, although the nurses possess less symbolic power than the an-\nthoposophic al physicians, in many cases they prevailed. A close look at the \nactual practice indicates that although, at a rough guess, the administration \nof pain-killers and sedatives is still less common in this anthroposophical \nhospital than in conventional medical health facilities, it is still more com-mon than anthroposophic medical actors intend. Their symbolic power ulti-mately seems less than originally anticipated. Thus, when it comes to the practice of administering pain-killers and sedatives within the practice of an-throposophical end-of-life care, it is the anthroposophic al physicians in this \ncase who are the \u201coppressed actors,\u201d most probably because they orient themselves towards the alternative religious field instead of the conventional medical (or economic) field.  \nThe reasons for this finding are threefold. First, the nurses tried to act in \nconflicting situations in accordance with their own habitus, which was the conventional medical one. Secondly, they were closer to the patients at the \ncrucial time during the terminal stage once the physicians had more or less \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n56  Cp. Girke 2012 : 1061.   Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland230 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n backed away from the death bed. Thirdly, the hospital management ulti-\nmately turns the scales, even when it does not adopt a position on this issue discursively. Rather, as representatives of the hospital, its members are held responsible for its management and viability. In their doings and sayings, \nmoreover, conventional medical and economic rationalizations go hand in \nhand: being governed by the public health sector\u2019s standards and the eco-nomic habitus according to which time is money, they quite inadvertently prefer the administration of pain-killers and sedatives because it is less time-consuming than any anthroposophical end-of-life care practice and also ac-cords with the prevailing rules and regulations. \n  \n7  CONCLUSION  \n \nAnthroposophical end-of-life care belongs to both fields: from an emic per-\nspective anthroposophic medicine complements conventional medicine with \nspiritual knowledge, while from an etic perspective it pursues medical as well as spiritual and religious goals. This study, based on fieldwork in an anthro-posophical hospital, has provided three main insights about social practices in the intersection between the religious and the medical fields.  \nFirst,  in the course of anthroposophical end-of- life care, body-oriented \npractices that are rationalized by anthroposophical religious concepts gain momentum in relation to discursive practices in contact with the patients. After death, discursive practices among healthcare professionals gain in im-portance, while body-oriented practices with regard to the deceased lose in importance.  \nSecondly, by rationalizing their actions in a religious (anthroposophical) \nway amongst themselves, healthcare professionals not only explain their ac-tions, they also regain agency in the face of a terminal illness backed up by the institution. Body-oriented practices with anthroposophical rationaliza-tions therefore serve as a resource not only for patients but for staff members too, enabling the latter to support their patients even when, from a conven-tional medical point of view, nothing can be done anymore. From an anthro-\nposophical perspective, not only does the physical body have to be taken care \nof but other non-empirical bodies also have to be taken into account. One of the main references in this regard is the notion that patients need to let go of their various bodies throughout the dying process and beyond death and are  | 231 \n \n in need of support. Other rationalizations are the support of the souls\u2019 prep-\naration for the afterlife by taking care of the transcendent bodies and trans-cendent aspects of the dying patients. \nIt is important to note that, in the later stages of end-of-life care, anthro-\nposophical rationalizations occur in inter-professional communication, or in communication with the researcher, and only rarely in communication with the patients. Nevertheless, even though religion might not be a topic of staff-patient conversations, it is still practiced in the form of massages, baths, poul-tices, so-called \u201clittle somethings,\u201d and further body-oriented practices. \nThirdly, the examples in this study have shed light on the social context \nwithin which anthroposophical end-of-life care is carried out. The healthcare professionals are constantly contending with each other over the distribution of power and the appropriate set of rules to follow. Yet, anthroposophical end-of- life care -providers are not only contending with each other over their \nrespective social positions within a particular social field, they are also strug-gling over the different fields of (conventional) medicine and (alternative) \nreligion. It is the anthroposophical foundation of anthroposophical end-of-\nlife care that causes its actors to become involved in additional work and expense, as they not only act in accordance with the conventional medical field, but also orient themselves towards anthroposophy\u2019s own set of rules. Whereas this mostly occurs without problems, the need to play by two dif-ferent set of rules at the same time makes the practice of anthroposophical \nend-of-life care liable to conflict.\n57 \nAs we have seen, those physicians and nurses who are also trained in \nanthroposophic medicine generally have a higher social status. This does not \nmean, however, that they are more powerful in practice. As indicated by the practice of administering pain-killers and sedatives, the actions of nurses are determined rather by the habitus they have acquired in their conventional \nmedical training than by the influence of the anthroposophically trained nurs-\ning expert or physicians, notwithstanding her or their higher social position.  \nGiven that the hospital in question is an anthroposophical institution, one \nmight have expected that in cases of conflict medical treatment would be in \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n57  This is all the more the case when i t comes to discursive practices, such as an \nopen discussion about administr ating painkillers and sedatives, because dis-\ncourses require greater explanation and  thus more easily uncover conflicting is-\nsues and demands for autonomy.  Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland232 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n line with anthroposophical principles. In that case, in the example of pain-\nkillers and sedatives at the end of life, the position of the anthroposophical physicians would prevail. This is especially the case since anthroposophical physicians have more symbolic power than nurses because of their institu-\ntional position and their anthroposophical expertise. However, Zeugin s \nfieldwork revealed that in many cases the nurses successfully negotiated with the physicians in charge in favor of giving pain-killers and sedatives. Hence, often the nurses  position was implemented at the bedside. \nWe argue that there are three explanations for this:  a) Nurses are closer to the patients in terms of time, body care, and emo-\ntional contact during the last stages of life. This might be even more the case in anthroposophical end-of-life care because more body-oriented care prac-tices are performed in this period, as we have outlined above. \nb) Nurses tend to act according to their conventional medical habitus in \ncases of conflict between anthroposophical and conventional medical prac-tices and their respective rationalizations.  \nc) The hospital\u2019s management, including the most influential physicians, \nwho are anthroposophically oriented, has to keep the financial conditions of the hospital in mind. However, the financial challenges are rooted partly in the hospital\u2019s specialization in anthroposophic medicine, which goes along with additional remedies and technical facilities, as well as the greater ex-penditure of time involved in care. Examples are the applying of a poultice \nor a rhythmic embrocation instead of administering pain-killers and sedatives \nat the end of life.  \nThus, the anthroposophical hospital in question stands between the de-\nmands of the public health sector, its patients\u2019 needs and demands, the care-givers\u2019 attendance, and the anthroposophical orientation of its supporting foundation. All these interests mingle when it comes to anthroposophical \nend-of-life care, as they are apparently not located within the boundaries of \nany one social field. \n  \nBIBLIOGRAPHY  \n Arman, Maria/Ranheim, Albertine/Rehnsfeldt, Arne/Wode, Kathrin (2008): \n\u201cAnthroposophic health care\u2014different and home-like\u201d, in: Scandina-vian Journal of Caring Sciences 22/3, pp. 357\u2013366. \u2019\n\u2019 | 233 \n \n Bopp, Annette/Heine, Rolf (2008): Anthroposophische Pflege.
