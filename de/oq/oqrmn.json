The framewo rk of my investigation is (West-)Germany during \nthe last two decades of the 20 th  century. From a theoretical perspective, I show ho w the convergence \nbetween a broader understanding and increasing perv asiveness of technology, the increasing \ncommodification of the sensuous and emotional realm s as well as the revival (and redefinition) of the \nbody as a holistic entity has paved the way for a n ew ethos of beautiful well-being. Methodologically,  \nan analysis of the media discourse on food and cosm etics enables me to concretely demonstrate how \na new form of internalised lifestyle discrimination  has been historically negotiated in the German \ncontext.  \n \nGerman \nDiese Arbeit untersucht den Hype um die \"healthy li festyle technologies\", die vor allem von Fitness- \nund Wellnessideologien propagiert werden. Der Unter suchungsrahmen ist (West-)Deutschland in \nden letzten beiden Jahrzehnten des 20. Jahrhunderts . Aus einer theoretischen Perspektive zeige ich, \nwie die Konvergenz eines weiteren Verst\u00e4ndnisses un d der Allgegenwart von Technik, der \nwachsenden Kommodifizierung sinnlicher und emotiona ler Welten wie auch die Wiederbelebung \n(und Neudefinition) des K\u00f6rpers als holistische Ein heit den Weg zu einem neuen Ethos des \nWohlbefindens in Sch\u00f6nheit bahnte.

Beyond a cert ain gain in expertise and wisdom garnered over \nthe years, my intuition that the fitness and wellne ss craze was there to remain with us for a while ha s \nbeen confirmed. This is the intellectual aspect tha t probably sustained me in the often arduous \ncompletion of this study.  \n \nBut more than anything it is the people involved in  my project who have carried me through. Thus I \nwould like to extend my heartfelt thanks to:  \n \n-Ulrich Wengenroth, my supervisor. He took the risk  of hiring an academic \u201cmestiza\u201d, sparked my \n\u201chistory of technology\u201d flame and \u2013last but not lea st\u2013 believed in and supported me against all odds.   \n \n-My former colleagues at the \u201cFachgebiet Technikges chichte\u201d (the erstwhile \u201cZentralinstitut f\u00fcr \nGeschichte der Technik\u201d) of the Technische Universi t\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen \u2013most prominently Martina Blum, \nAndrea Spiegel, Heike Weber and Karin Zachmann. The y welcomed me into the German academic \nworld and nurtured me intellectually while providin g priceless administrative and emotional support.   \n \n-The colleagues involved in the DFG research group \u201cWechselwirkungen zwischen Naturwissenschaft \nund Technik\u201d at the Deutsches Museum. They gently f orced me to define, clarify and justify my \nproject in the framework of our very heterogeneous multidisciplinary group. \n \n-The early members of the ESF-\u201cTensions of Europe\u201d consumption network \u2013most notably Mika \nPantzar, Elizabeth Shove and Thomas Brandt. Their e xpertise and exciting insights in the \nconsumption field opened up a whole new vista for m e.  \n \n-The staff and students of the \u201cHistory and Sociolo gy of Science\u201d department at the University of \nPennsylvania, where I was privileged to spend 3 mon ths as a visiting scholar in the autumn of 2003 \u2013\nespecially Ruth Schwartz-Cowan and Corinna Schlombs . They warmly welcomed me into their close-\nknit and very stimulating intellectual community.  \n \n-John Staudenmaier and the many attendees of the An nual \u201cSociety for the History of Science and \nTechnology\u201d conferences I attended over the years. In this context, a special mention goes to the \nstaff and attendees of the SHOT Summer Writing and Publication Workshop in Cape Cod (MA) in \n2004. They asked the right questions, pointed me to  overlooked (re)sources, mentored me and \nprovided countless shining examples of a rich and t horough American scholarship.  \n \n-My friends here and abroad. They shared the intell ectual excitement, tided me over very troubled \nwaters while affectionately goading me by repeatedl y reminding me that \u201cyes, you can do it!\u201d.    \n \n-And, last but certainly not least, my family. They  have borne up with me and my eccentricities for so  \nlong... And yet, they have loved me, tolerated my p atchwork life and provided countless hours of \nemotional and logistical support. Bless them! \n \n 5 \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n \nChapter 1 ( Introduction ) \nMapping the Healthful Planet           7 \n        \nChapter 2 ( Methodology )         17 \nTracking Wholesome Embodiment: of Means and Methods \u2026      \n\u2022 Introduction          17 \n\u2022 Situating the author         18 \n\u2022 Appropriating fitness and wellness through the medi a     19  \n\u2022 Accessing fitness and wellness sources       26   \n\u2022 Geography: why Germany?        30  \n\u2022 Time frame: why focus on the \u201clate twentieth centur y\u201d?     33 \n\u2022 Food and cosmetics as healthy lifestyle technologie s     38 \n \nChapter 3 ( Theory ) \nTheory at the Intersection         40 \n\u2022 Introduction          40 \n\u2022 Under the sign of the body        41 \n\u2022 Technology           52 \n\u2022 Commodification          71  \n\u2022 Embodied consciousness        86 \n \nChapter 4 ( History ) \nA New Form of Lifestyle Discrimination?

L\u2019id\u00e9al premier est \ndevenu celui d\u2019un projet global, une promesse servi e par la technique et l\u2019instrumentation: \ncelle d\u2019une action sur soi. 2  \n          Georges Vigarello \n    \nOver the last couple of decades, purchasing healthy  lifestyle technologies in Germany has \nbecome an increasingly baffling pursuit. In the 195 0s, shoppers could soundly base their \nrationales on straightforward functional claims, bu ttressed by \u201crock-solid\u201d scientific \nexpertise, as illustrated in an ad for Edina , a radioactive face-mask: \u201c *natural, harmless skin \nrejuvenation *for every skin type and every age *br eathtaking success even after the first \napplication *tested by scientific authorities and a ssessed as \u2018absolutely outstanding\u2019\u201d. 3 \nNowadays however, the proliferation of health and b eauty-related goods and services \nmeans that consumers are faced with choosing from a  huge array of products \u2013products that \nare mediated by an equally vast chorus of mainly se lf-proclaimed (hence often \ncontradictory) experts. Grabbing a fitness bar betw een work and a hectic routine at the local \ngym means that one has to plan at least an extra fi ve minutes to consider the comparative \nadvantages of L-carnitine 4 or omega-3 fatty acids 5. Even choosing between bath salts and a \nshower gel amounts to a quasi-spiritual conundrum s ince it appears to be a trade-off \nbetween a ravishingly transcendental experience:  \n \nBathing with Kneipp Wellness bath salts is a bit li ke relaxing near the seaside. Pure salt \ncrystals combined with highly aromatic essential oi ls and natural skin-toning oils in a dream-\nlike symphony provide a unique bathing experience. Enjoy the magic fragrance that enhances \nwell-being and harmony and experience how precious jojoba oil endows your skin with a \nsilky smooth gloss, with softness and comfort. This  is how bathing becomes a holistic \nwellness experience for body, mind and soul. 6 \n                                                 \n2 Vigarello, Georges , Histoire de la beaut\u00e9: Le corps et l\u2019art d\u2019embell ir de la Renaissance \u00e0 nos jours , Paris: \nEditions du Seuil, 2004, pp. 176-177 : \u201c Ultimately, a discreet but decisive metamorphosis h as taken place: the \n\u201cbeautified\u201d body is not only submitted to face car e or generic physical movements or even slimming ba ths, it is \nsubmitted to precise corrective applications, to ma ssages, to diverse topological interventions.

It helps your skin stay soft and smooth whilst its relaxing fragrance immerses you \nin an aura of tranquillity and peace. 7 \n \nWhat then has happened to German consumers along th e way? Have they all forsaken \ndiscriminating \u201cProtestant\u201d rationality for a softl y passive \u201cBuddhist\u201d path? Or are they \nsimply the bewildered victims of crafty marketing g urus? \n \nThese bars and toiletries are but two emblematic ex amples of the type of \u201cfitness & \nwellness\u201d products that compete for the attention o f health-conscious German shoppers. \nThey are emblematic in the sense that they mark a s ignificant shift in the type of products \nthat are perceived as health- or appearance-enhanci ng. Fitness bars do not just provide a \nraw supply of carbohydrates to keep active individu als going before they can afford the \nluxury of a more leisurely meal. Similarly, salts o r shower gel are no longer reduced to \nfunctional claims about cleaning, purifying, soften ing or deodorizing the skin, but are \nexplicitly designed to trigger the experience of health and well-being. Moreover, they \nillustrate the extent to which experience is suppos edly fostered: healthy feeling skin is no \nlonger enough, since acting upon the skin is envisi oned as impacting a holistic entity. The \nsensuous effect of skin-toning and essential oils p enetrates way beyond the outer shell of \nthe body to reach the emotions and even the soul\u2026 \n \nIf these examples appear somewhat far-fetched, they  do illustrate what a perilous exercise it \nhas become to precisely delineate the effect of \u201che alth & beauty\u201d products on the body. \nIndeed these products are designed to appeal to sub jective perception and experience and \nthey are commonly inscribed in the \u201cfitness\u201d or \u201cwe llness\u201d constellations. Without \nanticipating too much on the historical contextuali sation of these ideologies, 8 the following \nremarks provide a cursory overview of their traject ories. Fitness is rooted in post-war \npreventive medicine trends but was only truly popul arised in the 1970s in the U.S. and in the \nlate 70s-early 80s in Germany. Its central pillars are regular cardio-vascular exercise and a \nhealthy (i.e. low fat & low sugar) diet to counter the ills of a sedentary lifestyle. The \nemphasis here is on bodily control and performance.  Wellness is also rooted in a post-war \npreventive health ethic but its popular disseminati on was slower than that of fitness \u2013the \nlate 70s in the U.S. and the early 90s in Germany. It preaches a more holistic approach to \nbody care than fitness to compensate for the wear a nd tear of everyday life. By including \nenvironmental, emotional and even spiritual compone nts, wellness explicitly recognises that \nmind and body are mutually influential and that the  boundaries between them are fluid. \nHarmony and pleasure thus become central tenets in the pursuit of mind-body health. Such \na holistic understanding of health expands its defi nition well beyond either an absence of \ndisease or injury or the attainment of an optimal l evel of metabolic functioning, based on \n                                                                                                                                                         \nwertvolles Jojoba\u00f6l Ihrer Haut einen samtigseidigen  Glanz, Geschmeidigkeit und ein wohliges Hautgef\u00fchl  \nverleiht.

Indeed, already in \nthe late 1940s, the World Health Organisation (WHO) , defined health as \u201ca state of complete \nphysical, mental and social well-being and not mere ly the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d 9 \nEquating health with physical, mental and social we ll-being thus goes (well!) beyond optimal \nmetabolic functioning and explicitly acknowledges a n eminently subjective dimension, since \nstating that one feels well is ultimately the provi nce of the individual rather than that of an \nexternal medical authority. 10  \n \nOver time, by going beyond or even escaping medical  oversight, both fitness and wellness \nhave engendered a phenomenal commercial interest, t ranslated into a huge array of often \noverlapping, supposedly health-enhancing technologi es. This state of affairs has not only \nblurred the potential effects of these technologies  but also their ideological affiliation. In a \ndiscussion on the success of \u201chealthism\u201d 11  (which does not explicitly refer to either fitness  or \nwellness), the editors of The Sociology of Health Promotion  perceive a marked historical shift \nin the perception of health-enhancing products:  \n \nIn the 1960s a list of \u2018health-related\u2019 commodities  would have included items such as \naspirins, TCP, Dettol and plasters. Today, however,  it would include: food and drink; myriad \nhealth promoting pills; private health; alternative  medicine; exercise machines and videos; \nhealth insurance; membership of sport and health cl ubs; walking boots; running shoes; \ncosmetic surgery; shampoo (for \u2018healthy looking hai r\u2019); sun oil; psychoanalysis; shell suits; \nand so on. The list is seemingly endless. 12  \n \nThis impressive dilation of the health constellatio n is linked to what Mike Featherstone \nreferred to as \u201ctransvaluation\u201d when analysing the multiple benefits of jogging:  \n \nLike slimming, jogging provides further insight int o the transvaluation of use within consumer \nculture: everything has to be good for something el se and the range of alleged benefits \nmultiplies endlessly. Apart from reducing the chanc e for coronary heart disease, it is claimed \njogging helps to cure impotency, increase confidenc e, psychological well-being, and puts \u2018you \nin control of your body\u2019. Jogging has also been cla imed to result in prolonged cosmetic \nbenefits \u2013 improving posture, reducing stomach sag,  helping to burn off excessive fat. 13   \n                                                 \n9 Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health O rganization as adopted by the International Health \nConference, New York, 19-22 June, 1946; signed on 2 2 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States (Of ficial \nRecords of the World Health Organization, no. 2, p.  100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948.

Indeed, even if there are a series of normative  biomedical \nmeasures indicating \u201cnormalcy\u201d, health is also a ve ry subjectively experienced state, which means that  bio-\nmedical policies and providing optimal \u201cconditions\u201d  for health are only one aspect of working towards the \n\u201cright to health\u201d. \n11  For a good critical discussion of healthism, cf.

Thus, health \u2013or more c omprehensively well-being\u2013 no longer \nspells a form of passive freedom from physiological  complaints that can be swiftly and \nmechanically \u201cfixed\u201d by using the appropriate (para -)medical technologies. Rather, health is \na state that can, indeed must be actively pursued in virtually all the realms of everyday life. \nAnd it is inextricably linked to an economy that ha s commodified almost all the aspects of \nwell-being: from the table to the bathroom, from th e supermarket to the pharmacy or sports \noutlet, from leisure to soul care, and from insuran ce coverage to intrusive medical practices: \n \nCommodities have been \u2018transvalued\u2019 in two directio ns. First, some have been subject to a \nprocess whereby their original use value has been t ransformed into one increasingly \narticulated in terms of \u2018health\u2019 (for example, the \u2018greening\u2019 of household cleaning products, \nthe shift from decorative to health-enhancing cosme tics and various forms of leisure). \nSecond, and perhaps more significantly, some have b een \u2018transvalued\u2019 in the opposite \ndirection, in that their original health use value has been transformed to take on a much \nwider social and cultural meaning (for example, run ning shoes, shell suits and body \nbuilding). 15  \n \nThe transvaluation process thereby implies that hea lth, fitness or wellness have not only \nbecome lucrative labels to market a range of loosel y affiliated products and experiences but \nthat many of these have become cultural icons. Spor ts gear is a particularly good example of \nthis phenomenon. 16  Purchasing a pair of signature Air Jordan basketba ll trainers may not \nguarantee the average teenager any improvement in t erms of health or physical \nperformance. 17  But the aesthetic glamour embodied by the trainers  may well reinforce self-\nconfidence, peer group integration and provide a ta ngible trigger for emotions, dreams and \nfantasy \u2013in sum contribute to a positive sense of ( projected) identity. The same applies to a \nmyriad of other products, from exclusive health sup plements to Callanetics18  videos or \n                                                 \n14  In this study, I refer to \u201clate modernity\u201d as a co ntinuation of (and not a complete rupture with) mod ernity, in \nthe sense most prominently discussed by sociologist s Ulrich Beck, Anthony Giddens and Scott Lash. Cf. e.g. \nBeck, Ulrich, Giddens, Anthony and Lash, Scott, Reflexive Modernization: Politics, Tradition and Ae sthetics in the \nModern Social Order , Cambridge: Polity Press, 1994. Another arresting way of conceptualising this period is \nthat of Zygmunt Bauman\u2019s transition from \u201csolid\u201d to  \u201cliquid modernity\u201d: \u201ca condition in which social forms \n(structures that limit individual choices, institut ions that guard repetitions of routines, patterns o f acceptable \nbehaviour) can no longer (and are not expected) to keep their shape for long, because they decompose a nd melt \nfaster than the time it takes to cast them, and onc e they are cast for them to set.\u201d  Cf. Bauman, Zygmunt, Liquid \nTimes: living in an age of uncertainty , Cambridge & Malden (MA): Polity Press, 2007, p. 1 . This slow \ndisintegration or liquefaction of prior structures has significant consequences for both societies (es pecially in \ntheir nation-state incarnations) and individuals wh o are confronted with the increasing impossibility of long-\nterm planning and endeavours but paradoxically have  to bear the brunt of their \u201cfree\u201d choices.

She originally developed it to counter the effec ts of her 11 \n \nPilates 19  equipment. Superficially considered, they may seem  to state a healthy intent. But \ndepending on the consumer subjectivity at stake, th ey might say a lot more about (good) \ntaste, social belonging, purchasing power, etc. Jus t as in other realms of consumption, the \nsign often overrides the material function of the g ood.  \n \nThe transvaluation of health has thus also led to w hat one could call an aestheticisation of \nhealth or conversely a healthicisation of aesthetic s. 20  Concretely, this means that, to a large \nextent, health and appearance have become synonymou s: a beautiful body is necessarily \nhealthy and vice versa. 21  However, the potentially fascist weltanschauung en tailed in the \nhealth-appearance equation is undermined \u2013or rather  subtly diluted\u2013 by transforming the \n                                                                                                                                                         \nown back and knee problems but the method was soon marketed extensively (through books and videos) as a \nfitness/beauty routine than enjoyed soaring popular ity well into the late 1990s. Cf. \nhttp://www.callanetics.com/about.php  and http://www.callanetics.com/method.php . [website accessed Aug. \n2011] \n19 Pilates can be described as a series of low-impact exercises inspired by gymnastics, dance and rehabil itation, \nperformed with the help of various appliances, many  of them invented or improved upon by a German man,  \nnamed Joseph Hubertus Pilates [1880-1967]. His stor y classically begins as that of a frail unhealthy c hild, who \nmanaged to improve his condition through the practi ce of many sports, gymnastics and body-building. He  \nstarted to develop his own method as a detainee in Britain during WWI, strongly emphasising the rehabi litation \nof his co-detainees. During a subsequent stint in G ermany, he worked in close collaboration with the d ance \ncommunity before emigrating to the U.S. in 1926 and  opening a fitness studio in NYC. A number of mainl y \ndancer-pupils then opened their own studios in the 50s, 60s and 70s. But it was only when the clientel e \nbroadened to include Hollywood stars in the late 80 s that the popularity of the method soared like nev er \nbefore and began to appeal to a broad range of the American population before re-conquering Europe.

Impro ving one\u2019s health and appearance has become an obli gation, \nlinked to an ideology of individual responsibility as well as a logic of status display in promotional  culture.\u201d  She \nthen links the rise of a promotional subjectivity t o the transition to a service economy before conclu ding that: \n\u201cThis change in the organization of the economy and  work, from creating things to creating interaction s and \nimages, involves a shift in productive capacities. For service jobs, appearance and attitude are neces sary skills, \nwhich  \u2013 like any capacity \u2013 must be produced throu gh training and discipline (Foucault 1977).\u201d Cf. Maguire, \nJennifer, Fit for consumption:  sociology and the business of fitness , Oxford & New York:  Routledge, 2008, pp. \n51-52. Maguire even sees form as eclipsing function  since, from a promotional perspective, the appeara nce of \nhealth is increasingly more important than actual h ealth. Cf. ibid., pp 194-195. \n21  Mike Featherstone distinguishes between the inner body (\u201cthe concern with the health and optimum \nfunctioning of the body which demands maintenance a nd repair in the face of disease\u201d ) and the outer body \n(\u201cappearance as well as the movement and control of  the body within social space\u201d ), concluding that: \u201cWithin \nconsumer culture, the inner and outer body became c onjoined: the prime purpose of the maintenance of t he \ninner body becomes the enhancement of the appearanc e of the outer body.\u201d  Cf. Featherstone, Mike, \u201cThe Body \nin Consumer Culture\u201d, Theory, Culture & Society , September 1982, Vol. 1 no. 2, pp. 18-33, p. 18. B audrillard \narticulates both health and beauty as functions of the logic of prestige display:  \u201cHealth today is not so much a \nbiological imperative linked to survival as a socia l imperative linked to status. It is not so much a basic \u2018value\u2019 as \na form of prestige display. In the mystique of such  display, fitness stands next to beauty. Their sign s are \nexchanged within the framework of personalization, that anxious perfectionist manipulation of the sign  function \nof the body.\u201d  Cf. Baudrillard, Jean, The consumer society: myths and structures , London, Thousand Oaks, New \nDelhi: Sage Publications, 1998 [1970], p. 139  12 \n \ndyad into a triangle through an association with th e subjective  notion of well-being. 22  It is \nwell-being that lends a moral legitimacy to the pur suit of healthy beauty or beautiful health. \nTo my mind, this interdependent triangle represents  one of the most powerful dogmas of \nlate modernity: striving towards beautiful health o r healthy beauty in order to feel well \u2013\nindividually and socially\u2013 represents the core of s uccessful contemporary identity \nmanagement. 23   \n \nThe more or less conscious pursuit of this triangle  through activities as varied as buying \nhealth-enhancing products, introducing more movemen t into one\u2019s daily routine or \nmeditating means reinstating the holistic body as a  common denominator for many realms \nof everyday life. Which is why I would like to sugg est the term \u201chealthy lifestyle \ntechnologies\u201d (hereafter HLTs) to refer to these ma nifestations of commodified everyday \nhealth. This term also hints towards the fact that investing or working on the body is an \nongoing daily venture, since the body is not a stat ic entity: \n \nPhilosophical anthropology suggests that the body i s always a project for individuals, in that \nhumans are a peculiarly \u2018world open\u2019 species which requires for its survival that they \ncomplete themselves and their own environment. Buil ding on Giddens\u2019s work, however, I \nsuggest that in high modernity people have become u nusually aware of their own \nunfinishedness. Furthermore, the emphasis that many  modern individuals place on their \nbodies as constitutive of the self can be seen in m any respects as a retreat from the world-\nbuilding activity that is imperative to meaningful participation in social systems. 24  \n \nThus, for average consumers, \u201cbody-building\u201d \u2013not i n a narrowly muscular acception\u2013 often \nsupplants world-building, or becomes a crucial comp onent of the latter. This recourse to the \nbody no doubt indirectly points to the helplessness  of citizens facing socio-politico-economic \nconstellations that appear increasingly immune to d emocratic participation. 25    \n \nNevertheless, because so much energy and money is i nvested in them, body projects can \nalso count on the support of vast political and ind ustrial networks. But the blurring of health \nboundaries entails huge discrepancies between the v arious estimates of fitness and wellness \nmarket weight and growth potential. These estimates  are often a reflection of the \ninstitutional interests of the various state or mar keting agencies and professional \nassociations publishing them. For instance, estimat ed turnovers for the German wellness \nmarket in 1999-2000 ranged from 33 to 62 billion DM , depending on the sectors included. 26  \n                                                 \n22  I emphasise the notion of \u201csubjective well-being\u201d to distinguish it from the populistic national-soci alist \nacception of \u201cjoy\u201d as emblematised by the \u201cStrength through Joy\u201d  [Kraft durch Freude] movement. \n23  For a stimulating discussion of beauty as an evolv ing cultural value and the increasing duty to produ ce it, cf. \nB\u00f6hme, Gernot, Leibsein als Aufgabe: Leibphilosophie in pragmatisc her Hinsicht , Zug: Die Graue Edition, 2003, \npp. 189-207 (\u201cSch\u00f6nheistchirurgie).  \n24  Shilling, Chris, The Body and Social Theory , London: Sage, 1993, p. 182. \n25  Cf. e.g. Beck, Ulrich & Beck-Gernsheim, Elisabeth,  Individualization: Institutionalized Individualism and its \nSocial and Political Consequences , London, Thousand Oaks & New Delhi: Sage Publicati ons 2002, esp.

In it, Lutz Hertel, the di rector of the German Wellness Association, emphasis ed the \ndifficulty of appraising the market since, for exam ple, cosmetics market statistics do not differentia te between \ngoods clearly belonging to the fitness and health c onstellation (such as e.g. wellness bath salts) and  more \nbeauty-oriented goods such as nail polish remover.  13 \n \n \nTherefore, in order to sketch a slightly less confu sing picture, I wish to provide just a few \nstatistics drawn from individual sectors, which, wh en considered together, concretely display \na growing interest in \u201chealthy living\u201d. Between 199 5 and 1999 the market weight of natural \ncosmetics increased from DM 543 to 714 million 27   (approx. 7% increase p.a.). During the \nsame period, the market volume of diet and wholefoo d products met with a 4% growth, i.e. \na much more promising development than that of the food sector as a whole. 28  But a much \nmore striking development is the rise in per capita  bottled mineral water consumption: from \n12.5 litres in 1970 to 103.4 litres in 2001 29  (an average of about 7.1% increase p.a.), and this  \ndespite decisive improvements in the microbiologica l quality of tap water in the interval. 30  \nBetween 1990 and 2001, fitness club membership soar ed up from 1.70 to 5.39 million \nindividuals 31  (approx. 11% growth p.a.). Finally, the success of  the domestic wellness travel \nbranch can be illustrated by the increase in arriva ls registered at spa centres or \u201cKneipp\u201d \nresorts: between 1997 and 2001, they rose from 6.46  to 8.28 million 32  (approx. 6.4% growth \n                                                 \n27  Data drawn from the BBE-Branchenereport Wellness , K\u00f6ln: BBE Handelsberatung GmbH, 2002: Tabelle 52,  \nEntwicklung des Naturkosmetikmarktes in Mio.

Kne ipp spas or resorts have developed on the basis of the \nhydrotherapeutic tradition instigated by Sebastian Kneipp, one of the early forerunners of a German-st yle of \nhealthier living. Kneipp [1821\u20131897, Germany] was a  Catholic priest who promoted natural healing metho ds \nand thermal therapies based on five pillars: hydrot herapy, movement , phytotherapy, a healthy diet as well as a \nso-called \u201cOrdnungstherapie\u201d. The latter is defined  as follows: \u201eOrdnungstherapie als naturheilkundliches \nHeilverfahren umfasst alle indirekten (p\u00e4dagogische n) und direkten (naturheilkundlich-\u00e4rztlichen) Ma\u00dfn ahmen, \ndie geeignet sind, jene Ausgewogenheit zwischen Res sourcen und Anforderungen - und damit Gesundheit - zu \nerhalten oder wieder herzustellen.

[website accessed Aug. 2011]  14 \n \np.a.). 33  Additionally, during the last couple of decades, f itness and \u2013with a slight time lag\u2013 \nwellness have proved the most ubiquitous labels on the market. There are wellness yogurts \nand fitness bars, wellness saunas and fitness routi nes, wellness shoes and fitness temples, \nwellness teas and fitness creams, and so on and so forth. In 2003, one could even find \nwellness packed lunches at the main train station i n Munich. 34   \n \nThe object of this study then is to find out how , and hopefully some of the reasons why , \ntechnology, commodification and the quest for embod ied consciousness have creatively \nconverged in the elaboration of supposedly new and optimised \u201cmanagement\u201d  styles of the \nbody. Concretely, I want to analyse how the innovat ive recycling and adaptation of \nhistorically evolved health rationales has enabled the emergence of the fitness and wellness \nideologies. The context here is Germany during the last two decades of the 20 th  century, a \nperiod that corresponds to the peak dissemination p hase of fitness as well as to the \nsuccessful launching of wellness, along with the HL Ts spawned by these movements.  \n \nThus, Chapter 2 ( Methodology ) covers the issue of my positionality as a multidi sciplinary \nresearcher and provides justifications for a focus on a media discourse analysis using media-\nbased sources as well as my choices of locale, time -frame and case-study areas. Indeed, I \ndeliberately decided to concentrate on ideologies t hat, in Europe and more pointedly in \nGermany, focus on lay consumers\u2019 agency in the sphe re of individual health, be it in terms of \nmonitoring, prevention and/or enhancement. 35  I wanted to focus on the diffuse sphere of \n\u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d health because I am more intereste d in the subjective implications and \nperceptions of healthy living than in the professio nal elaboration of a \u201cright living\u201d canon or \n                                                 \n33  To a large extent, these figures neatly mirror obs ervations made in the American context in the 1980s , cf. e.g. \nGlassner, Barry, \u201cFitness and the Postmodern Self\u201d,  Journal of Health and Social Behavior , 30, 1989, pp. 180-\n191, p. 180. \n34  At the time, Rubenbauer \u2019s Wellness Box included a tomato & mozarella sandw ich, an apple and a bottle of \nF\u00fcrst Bismarck wellness water (with ginseng and her bal essences). \n35  This strategy, while it does explicitly bypass the  nature of healthcare provided by officially sancti oned \nallopathic and (often more informally trained) alte rnative health practitioners, should not be read as  an \nattempt to discount their role in the fostering of the fitness and wellness trends. In that respect, o ne should \nnote the influence of increasing professionalisatio n in various body-centred sectors, linked to the de velopment \nand ramifications of \u201cbody maintenance\u201d imperatives . A good example of this professionalisation is the  wide \ndissemination of nutritionists, fitness consultants , beauticians, naturopaths, etc. or body-oriented ( psycho-\n)therapists working along principles developed by \u201c traditional\u201d healing systems such as Traditional Ch inese \nMedicine or Ayurveda, \u201calternative\u201d healing systems  such as homeopathy or anthroposophy, or by pioneer  \npractitioners such as Wilhelm Reich, Alexander Lowe n or Moshe Feldenkrais, to name but a few examples.  Gert \nSteffen in his opus entitled  Trendbranche Wellness \u2013 Fitness:  Berufsportr\u00e4ts aus der Welt der Wohlf\u00fchlprofis  \n(N\u00fcrnberg: BW Bildung u.

He emphasises the fact that many new \nprofessional orientations have emerged in the wake of fitness and wellness but that, more often than n ot, the \nfancy job titles flaunted by a number of individual s do not guarantee serious in-depth professional tr aining. He \nthen points to the growing role of the German Welln ess Association [Deutscher Wellness Verband] in the  \nquality assessment of wellness job training.

As we are about to  see, the mediation and appropriation \nof \u201cfitness & wellness\u201d discourse presupposes that individuals are endowed with the skills to \ninform themselves as well as to choose and combine various health strategies. This \nconsumer bias necessarily implies that, beyond prod ucers and mediators\u2019 guidance, \nindividuals have the last say about what feels  good. \n \nHowever, in the course of my quest I soon found out  that, due to a lack of appropriate \nsources, a user-centred perspective on LHTs could n ot really be envisaged from a historical \nperspective. De facto, their ambivalent relationshi p with the body is reflected in two \ndiscursive extremes: a relative absence \u2013as a conse quence of the normalisation of body-\ncentred practices or the modesty surrounding them\u2013 or a stylised ostentation \u2013characteristic \nof \u201chealth epiphany\u201d narratives. This state of affa irs led me to develop a more mediation-\ncentred analysis, mainly grounded in advertising di scourse, in a effort to come to grips with \nthe zeitgeist \u2013if not always the concrete actors\u2013 p residing over this ideological turn.   \n \nParadoxically, even this relatively disembodied per spective highlighted the identity tensions \nexperienced by individuals confronting a globalised , late-modern, technology-intensive \neconomy:    \n \nIf the experience of living in high modernity is li ke riding a juggernaut which is out of control, \nthen at least the body provides individuals with a \u2018last retreat\u2019, an entity which appears to be \na solid basis on which a reliable sense of self can  be built. The problem with such investment \nis that the body has become an increasingly inadequ ate basis on which this project of the self \ncan be built. This is because the body is itself im plicated in technological developments, or \n\u2018abstract systems\u2019, which have called into question  our sense of what the body is. 36  \n \nThis quote fittingly recaptures the main issue tack led in my study as it is articulated in \nChapter 3 ( Theory ), i.e. how do socio-historical perceptions of the body intersect with the \nhistory of technology? And further, how do these di mensions articulate with the history of \nconsumption and holism during the last two decades in Germany? Therefore, I formulated \nmy working hypothesis as follows: the historical em ergence and seemingly successful \nappropriation of the fitness and wellness ideologie s is linked to a \u201cnew\u201d perception of the \nbody \u2013a body that is no longer a given, but a perfe ctible entity. This perfectibility is driven by \nboth increased technological feasibility and commod ification processes that are virtually \nubiquitous in the realm of consumption. In parallel  though, late modernity has also fostered \nthe re-cognition that the status of the body is ess entially ambivalent and fragile: whether it \nis object or subject, natural or cultural/technolog ical, flesh or sign/text, pure biology or \nholistic entity, machine/mechanics or consciousness , resource or ecosystem cannot be \nsatisfactorily or definitively ascertained. The \u201cir resolvability\u201d of these tensions seems \nconfirmed by the dead-end academic controversies ov er the status of the body \u2013\ncontroversies involving factions as diverse as posi tivists, semioticians, phenomenologists, or \ngender theorists of various persuasions.  \n \nSurprisingly then, I found out that it was at the f rontier between the humanities and the \nharder sciences that a more refreshing and promisin g perspective was evolving. Indeed, \nmany strands of physiological and psychological res earch in the course of the 20 th  century \u2013\nsuch as psychosomatic medicine, biochemistry, psych ophysiology, and cognitive \n                                                 \n36  Shilling, Chris , op. cit., p. 182. 16 \n \nneurosciences\u2013 now seem to agree that the tradition al mind/body divide is not a very \nfruitful working hypothesis. For instance, a number  of studies on stress, so-called civilisation \ndiseases, and neuropsychological disorders have dem onstrated that there are close, \ntraceable interactions not only between lifestyle a nd physiology but also between \nemotional, mental or even spiritual variables and t he well- or ill-being of the body. 37  Even if a \nprecise causality may be difficult to ascertain une quivocally, the co-incidence of significant \nfactors is at the very least striking. Thus, beyond  its fleshiness, the body may be much more: \nnot only the mediator but perhaps also the trigger or even the seat of thoughts, emotions, \nconsciousness and faith. It is on this still shaky premise that ideologies such as fitness and \nespecially wellness operate: they claim that a heal th-enhancing convergence of body, \ntechnology and consumption should be sealed by the endorsement of personal subjectivity \u2013\nas emblematised in the success of holistic or even spiritual(ist) health practices. 38   \n \nHowever, these relatively recent developments may f alsely convey the impression that the \nacknowledgement of an embodied consciousness is a r ecent achievement, which is why \nChapter 4 ( History ) delves into the historical roots of fitness and w ellness, highlighting \ncontinuities and disruptions in both the German and  American contexts. Instead of a linear \nappraisal of precursory movements, I articulate my historical narrative around the tension \nbetween work and leisure as they relate to health m anagement since this tension still is at \nthe heart of both the fitness and wellness ethics. The emphasis here is on the development \nof a new form of internalised lifestyle discriminat ion, a competitive intragenerational \nendeavour to attain beautiful health and wellbeing.   \n \nThe case-studies developed in Chapters 5 ( Food Case-Study ) and 6 ( Cosmetics Case-Study ) \nrepresent in-depth micro-analyses of the discursive  articulation of health in the domains of \nfood and cosmetics from 1980 to 2000. This period i s characterised by a fundamental \nreappraisal of the contributions of nutrition and c osmetics to the holistic health of the body. \nIn the food realm, I have detected a clear move awa y from traditional staples and \npreparation methods towards increased international isation and convenience, with two \nseemingly contradictory offshoots, namely authentic  food and functional food. In the \ncosmetics realm, the main tension resides in the am bivalent negotiation of the natural and \ntechnological spheres as they relate to the pursuit  of youth, beauty and health.   \n \nFinally, Chapter 7 ( Conclusion ) provides a summary of my main conclusions highlig hting the \nthread that has guided my reflection in this study.  In it, I sum up the most popular strategies \nused to market healthy lifestyle technologies and h ow they contribute to a new moral \neconomy of health.   \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n37  Cf. e.g. Selye , Hans,  The Stress of life.

[...] It is not \nby the direct method of a scrupulous narration that  the explorer of the past can hope to \ndepict that singular epoch. If he is wise, he will adopt a subtler strategy. He will attack his \nsubject in unexpected places; he will fall upon the  flank, or the rear; he will shoot a sudden, \nrevealing searchlight into obscure recesses, hither to undivined. He will row out over that \ngreat ocean of material, and lower down into it, he re and there, a little bucket, which will \nbring up to the light of day some characteristic sp ecimen, from those far depths, to be \nexamined with a careful curiosity. 39  \n \n          Lytton Strachey \n \nIntroduction \n \nOne may or may not agree with Lytton\u2019s Strachey\u2019s a dmittedly tongue-in-cheek assessment \nof historians\u2019 main asset as well as their methodol ogy of choice. Nevertheless, Strachey aptly \nrecaptures a fragmented subjectivity perilously fis hing through a sea of information as the \nhallmark of any (late-)modern historical endeavour.  Closer to us, Ulrich Wengenroth also \nsuggests a sobering relationship between historians  as \u201csecondary witnesses\u201d and their \nsources: \n \nThanks to the sources available to us, we can say s omething about the past but we cannot \nsay everything, nor can we say with certainty what meaning it had for people in the past. But \nwe can say what meaning it has for us. We create me aning from sources and thus our \nidentity as participants and actors in a lengthy tr ansformation process. This is the essence of \nhistory as a reflective science. 40  \n \nBut bounding the \u201cmeaningfulness\u201d goals of historic al inquiry may also represent a liberating \nstep for historians. By limiting their scope and cl arifying their politics of location \u2013involving \ndimensions of both professional legitimacy and pers onal identity or authenticity, historians \nhave gained a much greater credibility than by clai ming a universalistic stance. Indeed, at \nleast since the academic emergence of gender studie s as well as postcolonial history and \nliterature (not to mention the more general impact of \u201cpostmodern\u201d thought on almost \nevery academic discipline), it has become clear tha t any intellectual endeavour that eludes \nclarifying its politics of location is not only uto pian but also plainly dishonest, in terms of \n                                                 \n39  Strachey, Lytton, Eminent Victorians , Whitefish (MT): Kessinger Publishing, 2004 [1918] , p. vii. \n40  Wengenroth, Ulrich, \u201eWas ist Technikgeschichte?\u201c, teaching material: working paper, cf. \nhttp://www.fggt.edu.tum.de/personen/ulrich-wengenro th/wengenroth-lehrveranstaltungen/was-ist-\ntechnikgeschichte/ : \u201cDank der auf uns \u00fcberkommenen Quellen k\u00f6nnen wir z war etwas dar\u00fcber sagen, was war, \naber nicht, was alles war, und darum letztlich auch  nicht mit Bestimmtheit, welche Bedeutung das, was war, f\u00fcr \ndie Menschen der Vergangenheit hatte.

In the preface to her s tudy on the records of an 18th century \nphysician writing about his female patients, Barbar a Duden astutely sums up the paradox of \nhistorians\u2019 positionality, especially when it comes  to accessing passed \u201clived bodies\u201d 42 : \n \nA critique of the school of thought, that denounces  corporeality as unhistorical, is just as \nnecessary as a critical screening of the concepts, the taxonomies and the analytical \nprocesses, through which a new and radical historic isation of the lived body, including its \ncultural representations and illustrations, may be achievable. As a historian, in order to \nunderstand the complaints of the Eisenach women, I must first be aware of my own self-\nevidences surrounding \u201cthe body\u201d as cultural prejud ices and maybe even learn to overcome \nthem: indeed I cannot climb into the past over my o wn body. 43  \n \nThus, I want to define, or even denounce, my enterp rise as limited. As I will be discussing it \nin the following section, these boundaries are mult ifaceted. The most obvious one is my own \npositionality, including my multidisciplinary orien tation, my personal interests as well as my \nspecific professional and personal experiences. Ano ther seminal influence on the project is \nthe decision to focus my analysis on media discours e and the stakes involved in primarily \nresorting to media-based sources. Finally, I define  and justify the spatiotemporal framework \nof my study as well as the choice of my specific ca se-study areas.  \n \nSituating the author \nThe fact that this dissertation is officially ancho red in the history of technology may obscure \nthe fact that its author does not boast a classical  curriculum in this field. 44  In my case, \nenthusiasm for this domain has been flavoured by a rather eclectic background since after \ncompleting a degree involving English- and French-s peaking literatures (specialising in \nEnglish-speaking Caribbean women\u2019s literature) as w ell as history of art, I moved on to \ncomplete postgraduate study in the sociology of sci ence and technology, while regularly \nteaching a variety of subjects in different schools . These disciplinary and professional \naffiliations have no doubt bequeathed me with a hei ghtened awareness of linguistic, \n                                                 \n41  A clearly defined politics of location becomes eve n more necessary when confronting postcolonial or \n\u201cminority\u201d history and literature combined with a g ender dimension, as illustrated by the brilliantly taunting \ntitle of the following anthology: All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, Bu t Some of Us Are Brave : \nBlack Women\u2019s Studies , Eds Gloria T. Hull, Patricia Bell Scott & Barbara  Smith, New York: The Feminist Press at \nthe City University of New York, 1982.

Duden, Barbara, Barbara Duden, Geschichte unter der Haut. Ein Eisenacher Arzt und seine Patientinnen , \nStuttgart: Klett-Cotta, 1987 (and 1991), pp. 9-10: \u201eEine Kritik der Denktradition, in denen K\u00f6rperlich keit als \netwas Unhistorisches dem geschichtlichen Feld gegen \u00fcberstellt wird, ist ebenso notwendig wie eine krit ische \nSichtung der Begriffe, Taxonomien und Analyseverfah ren, durch die eine neue, radikale Historisierung d es Leibes \nund seiner kulturellen Repr\u00e4sentationen und Bilder m\u00f6glich sein k\u00f6nnte. Um die Klage der Frauen in Eis enach \nverstehen zu k\u00f6nnen, muss ich zun\u00e4chst als Historik erin die eigenen Selbstverst\u00e4ndlichkeiten \u00fcber \u201eden  K\u00f6rper\u201c \nals kulturelles Vorurteil bewusstmachen, vielleicht  sogar \u00fcberwinden lernen: \u00dcber meinen K\u00f6rper kann i ch nicht \nin die Vergangenheit klettern.\u201c  \n44  However the relative youth of \u201chistory of technolo gy\u201d as an academic discipline means that few of its  \nrepresentatives can actually claim to have studied history of technology as undergraduates. As far as I can \nremember, during the time I spent working at the Te chnische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen and the Deutsches \nMuseum, I only encountered one colleague with an un dergraduate background in this discipline.  19 \n \naesthetic and gender issues and they have certainly  fostered an engagement with \nincreasingly rapid scientific and technological cha nge as well as the challenges of its \nappropriate mediation. On the other hand, my intere st in health and well-being owes more \nto my non-academic professional and personal histor y. A seminal early influence was no \ndoubt my Swiss grandmother, a passionate nurse and advocate of alternative therapies. \nFurthermore, growing up within the compound of a ho me for severely disabled adults and \nlater working with elderly, physically and/or menta lly handicapped individuals sharpened my \nsensitivity to the lived meanings of health and wel l-being and, more poignantly, their \nabsence. Finally, a severe health challenge led me to an even more personal and embodied \nexploration of these meanings. But how does this in formation concretely relate to the choice \nand design of this study? \n \nMy personal background has clearly favoured a focus  on healthy lifestyle technologies (HLTs) \nbecause they emphasise individual agency in the pur suit of health and boast an existential \nrelevance to me. But my academic background also gu ided my choice. Indeed, I deliberately \nchose to concentrate on HLTs (instead of e.g. more strictly \u201cmedical\u201d technologies) because \ntheir nebulous and ambivalent nature means that no single discipline is adequately equipped \nto come to grips with their far-reaching ramificati ons. In a sense, these phenomena beg to \nbe analysed from a multi- or transdisciplinary pers pective and I have freely indulged, \ndrawing on and confronting inputs from history, soc iology, anthropology, consumer studies \nor philosophy \u2013to name but the most obvious and wei ghty borrowings. This approach, while \nit may suffer from the unavoidable impressionism en tailed in collating broad and \nheterogeneous brush-strokes, presents the advantage  of transcending a more linear \ndisciplinary perspective that would fail to account  for the hydra-like natures of fitness and \nwellness. Thus, I may not have done full justice to  the insights I have borrowed by (partially) \nsevering them from their often complex disciplinary  or authorial moorings but I do hope that \nthis transdisciplinary \u201cpoaching\u201d tactic will provi de readers with a more multi-faceted yet \nsynthetic understanding of my topic.  \n \nAppropriating fitness and wellness through the medi a \nWhile I would have initially liked to broach my sub ject with a user-centred approach, it \nproved rather impractical due to the scarcity of un mediated sources on the one hand and, \non the other, because of the methodological challen ges entailed in relying on oral history \naccounts of body management. Indeed, there generall y is a dearth of personal, first-hand \naccounts that can either be traced back to a reluct ance to openly disclose private bodily \npractices or to such a naturalisation of these prac tises that specific accounting appears \nsuperfluous or even trite. Moreover, one may rememb er why and/or when one purchased \none\u2019s first car, evening gown or surf board and, wi th a bit of luck, one may also recall the \nemotions linked to the purchase. Perhaps one can ev en remember one\u2019s first jogging or \naerobics session. But who remembers when or why the y bought their first \u201cfitness\u201d \ndeodorant or brewed their first \u201cwellness\u201d tea, esp ecially if it took place 5, 10 or 15 years \nago? Unlike the exalted lyricism emanating from Pro ust\u2019s famous encounter with the \n\u201cmadeleine\u201d, contemporary written (or ex-post oral)  sources emanating from users rarely \nemphasise the emotions and practices bound with the  integration of these products in \neveryday life \u2013even if this scarcity sporadically c ontrasts with the occasional exhibitionistic \naccount of a personal health and beauty \u201cepiphany\u201d.45   \n                                                 \n45  It is worth noting that so-called \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d phenom ena such as various review websites, fora and blogs  may \nwell bring about a change in user discourse on body -centred products. A number of consumer review webs ites 20 \n \n \nThis is why I decided to focus my analysis on media  discourse, strengthened by Niklas \nLuhmann\u2019s statement whereby \u201cWhat we know about our society, indeed about the w orld \nitself in which we live, we know through the mass m edia\u201d46  even if, as he hastens to add: \n \n\u201c[...] we know so much about the mass media that we  cannot trust these sources. Suspecting \nmanipulation, we resist, but this does not lead to significant consequences, since the \nknowledge acquired from the mass media seems \u2013of it s own accord\u2013 to merge into a self-\nreinforcing structure. One will stamp all knowledge  with a sign of doubt but will still have to \nbuild upon it, to connect with it.\u201d47    \n \nIndeed, when it comes to appropriate body managemen t, the media play a central if often \nambivalent role. In Chapter 3 ( Theory ), in the \u201cUnder the sign of the body\u201d section, I h int to \nthe fact that the body, as a medium itself, is inti mately tied to a broader media landscape \u2013\nwhich both influences the perception of the body wh ile being influenced by the body as \nmedium. Indeed, the perception of bodily normalcy ( be it in terms of health or aesthetics) is \nvery often shaped through recourse to the media but , in parallel, the material embodiment \nof media users is increasingly acknowledged as a se minal influence on cognitive and \nemotional processes during media consumption. Hence , when it comes to the actual \nmoulding of the body through ideologies and practic es generated by the fitness and wellness \nmovements, the media represent a privileged arena w here health options are frequently and \noften hotly debated. 48  This should come as no surprise since in a late mo dern context \u2013\nwhere traditional knowledge and expertise about the  welfare of the body are increasingly \ndifficult to access and/or contested and where self -realisation options dizzyingly abound\u2013 \nthe media may provide a welcome sounding board for increasingly confused consumers:   \n \nMy starting point is the view that, with the develo pment of modern societies, the process of \nself-formation becomes more reflexive and open-ende d, in the sense that individuals fall \nback increasingly on their own resources to constru ct a coherent identity for themselves. At \nthe same time the process of self-formation is incr easingly nourished by mediated symbolic \n                                                                                                                                                         \nsuch as e.g. ciao  provide contemporary views on a number of consumer  products that were rarely openly \ndiscussed before. Cf. e.g.  http://www.ciao.co.uk/Muller_Vitality_Yogurt_Drink_ _5607394  (U.K. version) or \nhttp://www.ciao.de/Balea_Wellness_Dusche_Lemongras_ _1129608  (German version). However, I perceive at \nleast two problems connected with the use of these reports as historical sources. The first obvious dr awback is \nthat the reports provided only review products cont emporarily available on the market and the second \ndisadvantage is inherent to the internet as a mediu m in general, i.e. most reports are anonymous or pu blished \nunder a pseudonym, which means that it is almost im possible to ascertain authorship. Hence it is obvio usly \nquite conceivable that a number of reviews were act ually written by the marketers of the products them selves. \n[websites accessed Aug. 2011]   \n46  Luhmann, Niklas, Die Realit\u00e4t der Massenmedien , Wiesbaden: Verlag f\u00fcr Sozialwissenschaften, 2009 [4th \nedition; originally published in 1995], p. 9: \u201eWas wir \u00fcber unsere Gesellschaft, ja \u00fcber die Welt , in der wir leben, \nwissen, wissen wir durch die Massenmedien.\u201c   \n47  Ibid.: \u201e[\u2026] wissen wir soviel \u00fcber die Massenmedien, da\u00df w ir diesen Quellen nicht vertrauen k\u00f6nnen.

K otro, Tanja & Pantzar Mika, \u201cProduct Development an d \nChanging Cultural Landscapes\u2014Is Our Future in \u2018Snow boarding\u2019?\u201d, Design Issues , Vol. 18, Issue 2, Spring 2003, \npp. 30-45. 21 \n \nmaterials, greatly expanding the range of options a vailable to individuals and loosening \u2013\nwithout destroying\u2013 the connection between self-for mation and shared locale. 49  \n \nBut as John Thompson further suggests, the recourse  to media in the process of self-\nformation leads to two important shifts: first medi a content is increasingly globalised, hence \noften loses its rootedness in local knowledge, and second, the power relationship inherent in \nexpertise is no longer configured in face-to-face i nteraction. Due to the non-reciprocal \ncharacter of mediated relationships, media consumer s may regain a form of autonomy and \nagency (hence also a form of expertise) that they m ay not experience when e.g. discussing \nhealth strategies with their GPs or their personal fitness trainers. 50  \n \nHowever, Brian Pronger suggests that, when it comes  to appropriate body management, the \ninformation propagated through a wide variety of me dia channels is not just designed as a \n\u201chelpful\u201d guideline but as a much more aggressive a nd controlling \u201csalvation\u201d doctrine \ninscribed within the paradigm of modern technology\u2019 s aggressive resource management:   \n \nWe can see versions of the doctrine first in the po sition papers of government agencies. \nSecond, versions appear in the scientific papers, t extbooks, and manuals of academic \nexercise science. Third, the doctrine also circulat es in popular books, magazines, and video \ntapes on exercise and physical fitness. Fourth, phy sical fitness appraisal, exercise \nprescriptions, regimens, procedures, equipment and exercise, and diet log books articulate \nthis doctrine as well. And, fifth, popular represen tations of the fit body abound. 51  \n \nIndeed, good examples of the doctrinal, almost coer cive quality of physical fitness mediation \nare plentiful in contemporary German media. A rando m sample of e.g. the weekly news \nmagazine stern  displays telling headlines such as \u201cAvoided and Despised: Smokers, The \nNation\u2019s Losers.

Cf. Thomps on, John, op. cit., p. 29.   22 \n \nemphasises that a number of studies have demonstrat ed that reception is far from a passive \nactivity. Instead: \n  \n\u201c[\u2026] individuals take hold of and work over the sym bolic materials they receive. In the \nprocess of reception, individuals make use of symbo lic materials for their own purposes, in \nways that may be extremely varied but also relative ly hidden, since these practices are not  \nconfined to a particular locale. Whereas production  \u2018fixes\u2019 symbolic content in a material \nsubstratum, reception \u2018unfixes\u2019 it and frees it up to the ravages of time. Moreover, the uses \nthat recipients make of symbolic materials may dive rge considerably from the uses (if any) \nthat the producers of these materials had in mind. Even if individuals may have relatively \nlittle control over the content of the symbolic mat erials made available to them, they can use \nthese materials, rework and elaborate them in ways that are quite alien to the aims and \nintentions of the producers. 56   \n \nJust as in the popular perception of technology \u2013mo ving from an all-powerful quasi-\nindependent nemesis towards a tool that is socially  shaped and can be harnessed by \nsociety\u2013 there is a distinct shift in the perceptio n of the media (and, linked to it, publicity). \nFrom the late 1950s onwards, with the emergence of the so-called \u201cuses and gratifications\u201d \napproach, the media and their contents were no long er perceived as an omnipotent power \nthat moulds and conditions public opinion and decis ions but as one societal force among \nothers. Individuals and the societies they particip ate in were seen as actively engaging with \nthe media, selecting, rejecting and appropriating w hat they need. As Elihu Katz put it, talking \nabout the active audience within the context of the  uses and gratifications approach: \u201c[...] \neven the most potent of the mass media content cann ot ordinarily influence an individual \nwho has 'no use' for it in the social and psycholog ical context in which he lives. The 'uses' \napproach assumes that people's values, their intere sts, their associations, their social roles, \nare pre-potent, and that people selectively 'fashio n' what they see and hear to these \ninterests\u201d .57  David Gauntlett quotes convincing examples of this  \u201cpick and mix\u201d attitude from \na qualitative interview carried out with female rea ders of womens\u2019 magazines in a few \n(mainly westernised) countries. Among other aspects , respondents highlighted notions of \ntime-killing, the attraction to a sensual layout or  content, self-indulgence expressed as a \nneed to relax in a virtual world, curiosity about n ew trends but also a marked reluctance to \n                                                 \n56  Ibid., p. 39. These findings neatly parallel what the French sociologist Michel de Certeau called \u201csu bversive \nuse\u201d when discussing consumers and their tactics \u2013a n aspect I discuss in the \u201cTechnology\u201d section of C hapter 3 \n(Theory ). \n57  Katz, Elihu, \u201cMass Communication Research and the Study of Culture\u201d, Studies in Public Communication , 2, \n1959, p. 1-6, p. 2. However, it should be noted tha t the \u201cuses and gratifications\u201d approach has evolve d \nconsiderably since then especially in the direction  of a more nuanced assessment of audience activenes s, cf. \ne.g. Rubin, Alan M., \u201cUses and Gratifications Persp ective on Media Effects\u201d, Media effects: Advances in Theory \nand Research , Eds Jennings Bryant & Mary Beth Oliver, New York & London: Routledge, 2009, pp. 165-184, p. \n172: \u201cA valid view of audience activeness lies on a cont inuum between being passive (and, perhaps, being mo re \ndirectly influenced by media or messages) and being  active (and, perhaps, making more rational decisio ns in \naccepting or rejecting messages) (A.M. Rubin, 1993) .\u201d  Also cf. ibid., p. 173: \u201cTherefore, it is reasonable to \nsuggest that differences in audience activity \u2013 as evidenced in ritualized and instrumental orientatio ns \u2013 have \nimportant implications for media effects. In other words, as Windahl (1981) argued, using a medium \ninstrumentally or ritualistically leads to differen t outcomes. Instrumental orientations may produce s tronger \nattitudinal and behavioral effects than ritualized orientations because instrumental orientations inco rporate \ngreater motivation to use and involvement with mess ages. Involvement suggests a state of readiness to select, \ninterpret, and respond to messages.\u201d  And finally, cf. ibid., p. 175: \u201cDifferences in personality, cognition, social \naffiliation, and motivation affect exposure, cultiv ation, satisfaction, parasocial interaction, identi fication, and \ncontent attention and elaboration.\u201d  23 \n \nstraightforwardly identify with \u201csuperwomen\u201d. 58  These findings seem correlated by the \nqualitative interviews carried out by Birgit Lawere nz in Germany, although, on the whole, \nher sample seems much more critical of women\u2019s maga zines as such. 59  \n \nKathrin Friederike-M\u00fcller in her study on the recep tion of Brigitte , one of the most \nenduringly popular, hence emblematic, women\u2019s magaz ine in Germany, shows that regular \nlong-term readers of the medium must be able to ide ntify with the idea of women \nchampioned in the articles. Indeed, a sustainable r elationship between reader and medium \ncannot feed on a permanently conflictual reading. T here has to be a certain congruence \nbetween what readers are experiencing (or want to e xperience) in their particular lifestyle \nchoices or phase of life and the inputs of the medi um \u2013regardless of whether the latter is \nused to broaden and differentiate the perspective o n particular lifestyle issues or as a more \n\u201cescapist\u201d tool to ease the transition between the work and leisure realms. 60  This however \ndoes not mean that consumers who have settled for a  particular medium passively concur \nwith every aspect of the medium during the act of r eception: \u201cThey choose from the broad \nvariety of themes, the articles that correspond to their current situation and provide \ninformation or thought-provoking impulses\u201d .61   Beyond these initial choices, readers actively \nand creatively negotiate the relevance or even the veracity of certain features, based on \ntheir own professional or personal knowledge. In th is process, women see and affirm \nthemselves as more competent and/or critical than t he journalistic source: \u201cA resistant \ninteraction with the text thus mainly provides self -confidence and strengthens a positive self-\nimage regarding progressive role attributions in th e professional arena\u201d .62  Personal taste or \ngender-conscious aesthetic sensitivities also fuel dissension when it comes to bodily ideals or \nwhat is perceived as fashion normativeness. \n \nMost interestingly, from my perspective, Friederike -M\u00fcller aptly analyses the ambivalent \nrelationship between readers and specialised featur e articles as well as publicity in the \ncosmetics and fashion domains. Generally, there see ms to be a certain scepticism regarding \ne.g. the cosmetics praised in beauty columns. Reade rs seem particularly conscious of other \ninformation sources that seem to contradict the med ium\u2019s advice and thus suspect collusion \nbetween the industry and the magazine. While reader s admit to being potentially more \nsensitive to the advertising contained in Brigitte than in other media, they fear the potential \nmanipulation of their consumer behaviour and the ri sks entailed in being badly advised:  \n \nThis defiant reception shows that readers are quite  capable of reflecting upon the links \nbetween magazines, advertisers and their own consum er behaviour \u2013a capability often \n                                                 \n58  Cf.

They have an ambiva lent relationship with the magazine as a \nproduct: on the one hand, they accept it but on the  other, they question it by confronting the \ncontent and looking for evidence of biased coverage . Thus, even if Brigitte might intend to \ninfluence its readers, the latter are not at its me rcy. Instead, as in other cases, readers \ndisplay media competence, resistance and critical f aculties. 63   \n \nOverall, it should be emphasised that the variety o f reception strategies 64  is a condition of at \nleast three main factors:  first of all, the type of media \u2013be it e.g. televis ion, radio, films, \ndailies, weeklies, internet, etc.; second, the freq uency and intensity of media-use; and, last \nbut not least, the socio-historical and economic si tuatedness of consumers, involving \nunequal access to a number of resources as well as varying power relations, which both \nimply different types of exposure but also highly d ifferentiated references, attitudes, \nexpectations, purposes, uses and involvement \u2013in sh ort, what one could refer to as a form of \nBourdieusian habitus .65   \n \nAt this point, it seems appropriate to briefly dwel l on Bourdieu\u2019s key-concepts of habitus and \ncapital, since both terms are useful tools in the a nalysis of media users in particular and \nmore broadly of consumers at large. Bourdieu define s the habitus as \u201cstructured structures \nprone to function as structuring structures\u201d .66  Concretely the dispositions constitutive of an \nindividual\u2019s habitus are acquired through socialisa tion. In turn however, individuals can use \ntheir habitus to create new social practices. Thus,  the habitus is not an entirely static and \ndeterministic notion condemning users/consumers to entirely predictable behaviours. \nIndeed, even though habitus dispositions are heavil y influenced by class, hence \ncharacterised by a certain permanence and ubiquity,  and even though they may be \nperceived as so natural as to be used unconsciously , they can and usually do evolve in the \ncourse of a lifetime. This evolution is mainly a fu nction of how individuals negotiate their \nacquisition of various types of capital \u2013economic, cultural, social and symbolic\u201367  within \ndifferent social fields. Applied to the domains of media use or consumer culture in general, \nthe interplay of habitus and capital acquisition th us articulate a complex web of influence \nand independence. In sum, however, as Michael Schen k concludes, the mass media hold a \nconsiderable influence in that they steer users\u2019 at tention through informational orientation, \nby means of \u201cframe-setting and focusing on particular reality e xcerpts, themes and \n                                                 \n63  Ibid. p. 364-365: \u201eDiese widerst\u00e4ndige Lesart zeigt, dass die Leserin nen durchaus zu einer Reflexion des \nZusammenhangs zwischen Zeitschriften, Anzeigenkunde n und ihrem Konsumverhalten f\u00e4hig sind, die ihnen i n \nfr\u00fcheren Analysen h\u00e4ufig abgesprochen wurde.

Selbst wenn Brigitt e eine \nbeinflussende Wirkung auf die Leserinnen intendiere n sollte, so stehen si dieser nicht schutzlos gegen \u00fcber, \nsondern beweisen auch in diesem Zusammenhang Medien kompetenz, Widerstand und Kritikf\u00e4higkeit.\u201c    \n64  For a detailed review of the successive trends in media effects studies, cf. e.g. Media Effects: Advances in \nTheory and Research , op. cit. (especially chapter 8: Rubin, Alan M., \u201c Uses-and-Gratifications Perspective on \nMedia Effects\u201d, pp. 165-184) or Schenk, Michael, Medienwirkungsforschung , T\u00fcbingen: J.C.B. Mohr (Paul \nSiebeck), 2002 [2 nd  edition].  \n65  I refer to the sociological acception of the term as suggested by Pierre Bourdieu, cf. especially: Bo urdieu, \nPierre, Esquisse d\u2019une th\u00e9orie de la pratique , Gen\u00e8ve: Editions Droz, 1972 & Bourdieu, Pierre, Le sens pratique , \nParis: Editions de Minuit, 1980. \n66  Cf.

Bourdieu, Pierre , La distinction. Critique sociale du jugement , Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1979.  25 \n \nattributes\u201d . He adds: \u201cIn many areas, the mass media convey a basic orien tation, they guide \nand mould the perspectives, thoughts and representa tions of recipients.\u201d 68  \n \nBut as emphasised in the Brian Pronger quote above,  media messages in the affluent \nwesternised world are relayed by such a wide variet y of channels that consumers may feel \nbombarded with a form of \u201csymbolic overload\u201d. This state of affairs forces individuals to \ndevelop strategies in the selection and appropriati on of information, by relying on various \ntypes of expertise. Thompson sees these systems of expertise as hybrid since they may \nprimarily rely on significant others\u2019 opinions but also on experts situated within the media, \nsuch as film or book critics, health gurus or telev ision gourmets as well as role-models drawn \nfrom films or TV serials. 69   \n \nIn sum then, as opposed to real life experience, me diated experience differs in substantial \nways in that it can be distant both spatially and t emporally. Also, through media embedding, \nreal life events become recontextualised in the med iated experience. Moreover, since \nindividuals\u2019 particular self-fashioning projects ar e continuously reshaped, mediated \nexperience displays a varying relevance, which mean s individuals may alternately find it \nirrelevant or so relevant as to blend it into their  everyday lived experience. Finally mediated \nexperience may be shared without being rooted in a common locale (as is the case with lived \nexperience). 70  These characteristics as they team up with an incr easingly fast and nomadic \npace of life mean that mediated experience, even if  it rarely supplants lived experience, 71  \nplays an increasingly important role in individuals \u2019 self-projects, even transforming the \nnature of the self. However the self is usually \u201cnot dissolved or dispersed by media messages, \nbut rather is opened up by them, in varying degrees , to influences which stem from distant \nlocales\u201d .72  \n \nSpecifically, in the case of fitness and wellness, their success seems to lie less in their \ncontents, which can hardly be described as revoluti onary, as in their skilful and ubiquitous \nmediation. Even if both phenomena are mostly confin ed to post-industrial societies, they are \nthe first health management philosophies that can c laim to have transcended neatly \nbounded national health ideologies and health-care systems through globalised marketing, \nwhilst integrating \u2013critics may say plundering\u2013 man y \u201cpostcolonial\u201d elements, such as a \nvulgarised patchwork of teachings drawn from variou s traditional health systems like \nAyurveda or Traditional Chinese Medicine. Moreover,  it is the media-fostered nature of \n                                                 \n68  Schenk, Michael, op. cit., p. 710: \u201eWir kommen zur Ergebnis, dass eine erhebliche \u2013 un d noch gar nicht \nausreichend erforschte \u2013 Wirkung der Massenmedien i n der informationsorientierten Aufmerksamkeitslenku ng \nzu sehen ist.

The media dissemina tes a huge number of messages about identity and \nacceptable forms of self-expression, gender, sexual ity and lifestyle. At the same time, the public hav e their own \neven more robust set of diverse feelings on these i ssues.\u201d Cf. Gauntlett, David, op. cit., pp. 286-287. \n72  Thompson, John, op. cit., p. 233.   26 \n \nfitness and wellness that primarily accounts for th eir hydra-like, self-generating tendencies. \nThis also explains the difficulties encountered whe n trying to detect their origins and \ncontents as well as their authors/producers and con sumers, since there is no centralised \ncontrol over their development and diffusion. \n \nAccessing fitness and wellness sources \nGiven this state of affairs, I have had to rely on an eclectic collection of sources including \nartefacts, their packaging and instructions for use  as well as retail recommendations, \nspecialised catalogues, lifestyle magazines, newspa pers, (para)medical, insurance and health \npolicy guidelines, readers\u2019 letters to the editor, etc. It is through the intersections and \noverlaps of this wide spectrum of sources that I wa s gradually able to map out the likely \noutlines of projected uses and users. Concretely, t he sources I was fruitfully able to draw \nupon were the following:  \n \n-Commercial statistics  related to the market volume of various fitness an d wellness products \nand services as well as marketing studies providing  micro-analyses of various health-related \nsectors. These figures are obviously central, since  they enable one to map out the \ndevelopment of health markets and concretely size u p their success. However, as already \npointed out in my introduction, these figures shoul d also be handled with care since \nestimates vary widely, depending on what products a nd services are included in the sector \nunder consideration, an aspect that usually betrays  the true identity and interests of the \norganisations publishing the figures. 73  \n \n-Market/ing or business studies, reports, analyses . Along with the above-mentioned \nstatistics, these sources often provide detailed se ctoral analyses that draw in not only purely \neconomic considerations but also historical, sociol ogical and psychological variables that \nmay shed insights on particular developments. A fre quent issue with these studies, however, \nis the difficulty to gain access to them, especiall y in terms of their often (very) high cost \u2013\nmaking them primarily available to corporate users.74    \n \n-Governmental and non-governmental studies and stati stics  (especially as they relate to \nPublic Health, preventive medicine, morbidity rates , civilisation diseases, alternative health \npractices, etc.) enable one to correlate health dev elopments and policy imperatives with the \nevolution of the health market. \n \n-Insurance guidelines and reports  enable one to trace the evolution of particular hea lth \nmentalities over time, especially the shift towards  preventive instead of curative measures \nand increased consumer responsibility. They also pr ovide a precious indicator of the shifting \nvalue of holistic prevention in ensuring global per sonal health. 75   \n                                                 \n73  Cf. Chapter 1 (Introduction). \n74  Cf. e.g. a telling contemporary example: Branchenreport \u2013 Wellness 2010 , K\u00f6ln: IBH Retail Consultants GmbH, \nAugust 2010, available online but costing \u201conly\u201d \u20ac1 ,450: http://www.markt-studie.de/studien/branchenreport-\nwellness-2010-p-123994.html?gclid=CPz6hY3vtKcCFYMRf Aodbwll_g . [website accessed Aug. 2011] \n75  A good example of this aspect is the huge coverage  discrepancies even between so-called \u201ccompulsory \nhealth insurance funds\u201d [gesetzliche Krankenkassen]  when it comes to reimbursing alternative health pr actices \nor providing sponsored health education classes. So me insurances such as Securvita (cf. \nhttp://www.securvita.de/index.php ) include acupuncture, homeopathy and anthroposophi cal medicine in their \nstandard coverage (cf. http://www.securvita.de/krankenkasse-securvita/leis tungen/naturheilverfahren.html ) , \nwhile also partially reimbursing e.g. Pilates, Nord ic walking, qi gong, yoga or reiki classes (cf. 27 \n \n \n-Various sources on or by fitness and wellness inven tors, disseminators, heroes, lead-\nconsumers/users , such as e.g.  (auto-)biographies, various health prevention/popul arisation \nbooks, websites, etc. The danger in this case is th at narratives are usually rather \nbiased/uncritical and often display clear (self-)ma rketing purposes.  \n \n-The actual/concrete products (including their packa ging and instructions for use) .76  The \ndesign of products, their descriptions and function ing often provide one with significant \nclues as to how producers envisage potential users.  No detail is really innocent, be it the \nmaterials used, the colours, the shape, the ergonom ics, the illustrations and diagrams, the \nexplanations that are either highlighted or left ou t contribute to both the \u201cscript\u201d 77  \nembedded or embodied in the object or its \u201caffordan ces\u201d. 78  \n \n-And last but certainly not least:  women\u2019s or lifestyle magazines, weekly news period icals \nand occasionally daily newspapers . For the period under consideration, i.e. the early 1980s \nto the late 1990s, there are virtually no newspaper s or magazines that focus solely on fitness \nor wellness. 79  So, the most fruitful source has proved to be wome n\u2019s magazines: Brigitte , F\u00fcr \nSie , Freundin , Bunte and Frau im Spiegel .80  Indeed, most women\u2019s magazines can be \ndescribed as quintessential \u201chealthy lifestyle\u201d mag azines, since they have long demonstrated \nan interest in the body, its technical management ( i.e. its shaping or moulding through a \nfocus on particular fashions, cosmetics, specific d iets, sports or physical activities, and DIY \nhealth practices) as well as its environment (both natural and artificial). In contrast, before \n                                                                                                                                                         \nhttp://www.securvita.de/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF-D ateien/krankenkasse/m-praevention-55.pdf ). Others, \nsuch as the AOK or Techniker Krankenkasse, while th ey do include some alternative health offers, are m uch \nmore sceptical or reluctant to promote or reimburse  alternative health therapies and usually require i nterested \ncustomers to take on additional coverage (cf. e.g. http://www.aok.de/bayern/leistungen-service/alterna tive-\ntherapien-34972.php  & http://www.tk.de/tk/wahltarife-und-zusatzversicheru ng/alternative-medizin/tk-privat-\nnatur-arznei/139750 ).

Bingle, Gwen & Weber, Heike, op. cit., p. 28: Madeleine Akrich\u2019s concept of scripts \u201cassumes that \nconditions of usage -which usually correspond to ce rtain user representations- are objectified in tech nologies. \nAkrich, as a researcher rooted in the Actor-Network -Theory (ANT), interprets artefacts/ technologies a s non-\nhuman actors that prescribe the behaviour of their (human) users. Thus, things AND people are shaped d uring \nthe innovation process. Innovators inscribe their v isions and predictions of the world in their object s, resulting in \na \u2018script\u2019. The \u2018script\u2019 metaphor refers to a film script because both define a framework for future a ctions. For \nAkrich, \u2018a technical artifact can be described as a  scenario replete with a stage, roles, and directio ns governing \nthe interactions between the actors (human and nonh uman) who are supposed to assume those roles\u2019. Many  \ndesign choices can thus be seen as \u2018decisions about  what should be delegated to the technology and wha t \nshould be left to the initiative of human actors\u2019.\u201d  Cf. also my discussion of scripts in Chapter 3 ( Theory), \n\u201cTechnology\u201d section. \n78  Ibid., p. 16: \u201cJames J.

[website accessed Aug. 2011] \n80  Marketing profiles of all magazine and newspaper s ources can be found in the Appendix. 28 \n \nthe lifestyle re-orientation of GQ  [originally: Gentlemen\u2019s Quarterly] in 1983, 81  the launching \nof FHM  [originally: For Him Magazine] in 1985,82  or Men\u2019s Health  in 1987, 83  men\u2019s magazines \ndisplayed a much less holistic interest in lifestyl e and body matters than their female \ncounterparts (except in terms of erotic content, th at is...) and tended to focus on \u201claddish\u201d \ninterests such as cars, electronics, fishing or por nography. 84  In Germany, men\u2019s magazines \nseem to only really have taken off in the mid- to l ate 1990s. 85  Thus, as opposed to the very \nbroad and often literally disembodied scope of gene ral weekly periodicals and the very \ncompartmented view of the body in older generation men\u2019s magazines, women\u2019s magazines \nwere poised to become an obvious and essential reso urce. Nevertheless, I have punctually \nrelied on articles drawn from a number of more gene ral weekly periodicals such as stern  and \nFocus  \u2013researched by keywords. In the course of the two decades considered, stern  and \nFocus  gradually began to feature more articles on body t rends, food, sports and alternative \nhealth concerns and also to display ads for cosmeti cs, etc.  \n \nWhile I had not initially planned to provide a cons ciously gender-specific focus in my study, \ngender has become a non-negligible dimension in my narrative on at least three counts. \nFirstly, because a focus on the body and its shapin g or management means that gender \nprovides an essential lens with which to view the e volving status of discourse on bodies \u2013as \ndiscussed in the \u201cUnder the sign of the body\u201d secti on in Chapter 3 ( Theory ). Secondly, a \nfocus on \u201cfood\u201d and \u201ccosmetics\u201d as case-study areas  has a built-in gender bias. Indeed, due \nto traditional divisions of labour and differentiat ed grooming cultures, both domains have \nlong been mainly the province of women even if \u2013as we shall see in the case-studies \nthemselves\u2013 one can detect a slow but seminal chang e in gender roles and grooming \nstereotypes in the course of the decades under cons ideration.  86  Thirdly, this last aspect \nobviously limits the types of relevant sources. Thu s, my account is perforce gender-flavoured \nsince my main sources are women\u2019s magazines.  \n \nIn general, all the sources quoted provided three d ifferent types of archival material, as \ndetailed below: \n \n                                                 \n81  Originally launched in the U.S. in 1931 under the title Apparel Arts  as a men\u2019s fashion, it was only in 1983 that \nit was revamped as a men\u2019s lifestyle magazine (cf. e.g. http://www.magsdirect.com/gqgentlemansquarterly-\nmagazine.html ). Much later, i.e. in 1997, it was launched in Ger many as a revamp of the ailing M\u00e4nnerVogue  \n(cf. Werkmeister, Meike, \u201cMen\u2019s Magazines in German y\u201d, 2003, online article: \nhttp://www.theoryhead.com/gender/germany.htm ). [websites accessed Aug. 2011] \n82  FHM was launched in the U.K. in 1985 (cf. e.g. http://hubpages.com/hub/FHM ) and in Germany in 2001 (cf. \nWerkmeister, Meike, op. cit.). [website accessed Au g. 2011] \n83  Men\u2019s Health was launched in the U.S. in 1987, the  German version in 1995. Cf. \nhttp://www.menshealth.com/mediakit/ ; http://www.magsdirect.com/menshealth-magazine.html ; \nhttp://www.menshealth.de/ihre-werbung-bei-uns.1987. htm ;  \nhttp://www.motorpresse.de/de/marken/lifestyle/mens- health/1351 .

Gauntlett , David, \n\u201cMen\u2019s Magazines and Modern Masculinities\u201d, op. cit ., pp. 164-189.  \n85  For an overview of the emergence of lifestyle maga zines in Germany, cf. Werkmeister, Meike, op. cit. \n86  A quick perusal of the cosmetics offer for men in 1980, as reflected in the F\u00fcr Sie  women\u2019s magazine, still \ndisplays a rather limited array of grooming product s, mainly aftershave (such as the classics Roger & Gallet, Old \nSpice or Tabac Original). More often, women are mor e or less explicitly pictured as mediators, as in a n ad for \nLabello lip salve with a line drawing picturing a w oman about to apply the salve on her husband\u2019s lips  in front of \na country house (F\u00fcr Sie, Heft 24, 1980). 29 \n \n-General and specialised press articles on fitness and wellness as socio-cultural \nphenomena . If they do not provide a true reflection of the pop ular appropriation of these \nideologies, the increasing density/frequency of the se articles nevertheless enables one to \ntake stock of the social hype surrounding these tre nds at particular points in time.   \n \n-Articles on particular aspects of these movements  (especially e.g. functional food, various \nfitness disciplines, alternative therapies, non-Wes tern medical systems such as Ayurveda or \nTraditional Chinese Medicine, health oases, etc.). Depending on their elaborateness, their \ntone and critical stance, these articles may help o ne to also gauge the degree of likely \npopular familiarity with new or exotic products and  processes. \n \nThese two types of material have proved essential t o determine a relevant period of \ninvestigation. \n  \n-Finally, advertising for products, practices and services . These sources are extremely \ninteresting and challenging but remain controversia l. Indeed, depending on the \ncontextualisation of the ad, they offer a privilege d vista into producers\u2019 and mediators\u2019 \nprojected visions of users and the use of specific products. However, these visions remain \nprojections: they may not match or may even heavily  distort both real use practices and \ngenuine user profiles. Moreover, it proves extremel y challenging to track the concrete \neffects of advertising on consumers: \n \nThe problem, of course, is that the effects of mark eting communications are due to a myriad \nof factors, some related to the characteristics of the communication itself (and, therefore, \nunder the control of the marketer) and some to rela tively uncontrollable factors, such as \nconsumer characteristics, marketing communications of competitors, and so forth. Further \ncomplicating the problem is the fact that the effec ts of marketing communications are not \nnecessarily direct. That is, it is exceedingly diff icult to separate the effects of media from \nmessage variables effects, both in the day-to-day p ractice of communications management \nand in empirical research on media effects. Communi cations and consumer characteristics \nalso interact: it is difficult to partial out the u nique effects of communication from the prior \nattitudes and experiences of consumers who see or h ear it. 87  \n \nWhile there seems to be some conclusive research on  the effects of advertising on personal \nand public health behaviour, especially as it perta ins to the consumption of cigarettes and \nalcohol, there is little on the effects of \u201chealthy  living\u201d advertising in general and, when the \nsubject is tackled \u2013as in research on the role betw een obesity and media consumption\u2013 it \noften focuses on the behaviour of children and teen agers. 88   \n \n                                                 \n87  Stewart, David W. & Pavlou, Paul A., \u201cThe Effects of Media on Marketing Communications\u201d, Media effects: \nAdvances in Theory and Research , Eds Jennings Bryant & Mary Beth Oliver, New York & London: Routledge, \n2009, pp. 362-401. Compared to the corresponding ch apter in an earlier edition [Stewart, David W. & Wa rd, \nScott, \u201cMedia Effects on Advertising\u201d, in: Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research , Eds Jennings Bryant \n& Dolf Zillman, Hillsdale NJ & Hove UK: Lawrence Er lbaum Associates Inc., 1994, pp. 315-363], the more  recent \none provides a broader overview of marketing commun ications than just traditional advertising since it  \nincludes insights on newer forms of producer-user i nteractions, especially since the advent of Web 2.0 . \n88  Cf. e.g. Walsh-Childers, Kim & Brown, Jane D., \u201cEf fects of Media on Personal and Public Health\u201d, Media \neffects: Advances in Theory and Research , Eds Jennings Bryant & Mary Beth Oliver, New York & London: \nRoutledge, 2009, pp. 469- 489.  30 \n \nWhereas for some researchers these points may suffi ce to disqualify the recourse to \nadvertising sources, there seems to be a growing co nsensus among consumption scholars \nthat publicity is  a valuable source to interpret both the cultural c ontext of a product and its \nuse(s). In the absence (or scarcity) of numerous an d accessibly unmediated consumer \nreports, advertising discourse can be seen as a pri vileged strategy to access a form of culture \nconcentrate that reflects the societal climate of a  particular period. As Kathrin Bonacker \ncontends, even if publicity standardises, exaggerat es and simplifies real life constellations, by \nvirtue of its primary mission, it must seek to not alienate a contemporary audience, hence \npotential purchasers. It can thus be analysed as a form of stage-setting device that can only \nsuggest new trends and ideas that are strongly embe dded in accepted  norms  and values. \nHence publicity designers do not create  the ritualised expressions they work with but \nbasically draw from a popular repertoire of represe ntations and idioms since the virtuality of \nadvertising images is bound by the necessity of cul tural intelligibility in order to secure \ncommercial success. 89  As Bonacker pointedly sums it up:   \n \nThis means that due to advertising images\u2019 immanent  intelligibility imperative, whimsical \nfantasy is and can only be found in these sources t o the extent that normal consumers can \nmake sense of them within their intellectual worlds , hence advertising images (must) have \nrecourse to already available patterns and images. 90    \n \nFurthermore, it should be noted that the role and e ffect of advertising is not limited to the \npre-purchase phase, it also provides a cultural fra me for the consumption of the product \nonce the latter has left the market. By emphasising  the value of the product in society, it \nmay serve to remind confused consumers or those pla gued with second thoughts that they \nhave made the right choice. \n \nFrom the justifications I have provided to support a media-based analysis to the description \nof my sources, the attempt to produce a contained a nalysis of body ideologies in Germany in \nthe late 20 th  century may appear rather illusory. But my content ion is that by limiting the \ngeographical scope and the time bracket of my inves tigation, what appears to be elusively \nglobal phenomena may instead be framed as eminently  meaningful trends that dialogue \nbetween the local and the global while evolving in an intelligibly cross-fertilizing manner. The \nfollowing two sections thus aim to both qualify and  justify the spatiotemporal dimensions of \nmy study. \n \nGeography: why Germany?  \nWhen the time came to choose my dissertation topic,  I was particularly intrigued by the \nprominence of the \u201cwellness wave\u201d in Germany, which  seemed to be increasingly \novershadowing the \u201cfitness craze\u201d. I had become acq uainted with both movements in \nSwitzerland, where similar developments had been ta king place over the course of the \n1980s-90s. But in Germany, the wellness concept see med even more ubiquitous: not a week \nelapsed without it making the headlines of a mainst ream newspaper and I started noticing \nthe boom of wellness products that went far beyond the realm of health-food shops to \n                                                 \n89  The ideas in this paragraph are freely quoted from  Kathrin Bonacker\u2019s Hyperk\u00f6rper in der Anzeigenwerbung \ndes 20. Jahrhunderts , Marburg: Jonas Verlag, 2002, p. 7-8. \n90  Ibid., p. 8: \u201eDas heisst, dass durch die den Werbebildern immane nte Notwendigkeit des Verstanden-Werdens \nphantasievolle Fiktion nur insoweit dort zu finden ist und sein kann, als sie den Normalverbrauchenden  in ihren \nGedankenwelten bereits verst\u00e4ndlich ist, dass sie a lso auf vorhandene Grundmuster und Bilder zur\u00fcckgre ift und \nzur\u00fcckgreifen muss.\u201c  31 \n \nconquer mainstream supermarkets. Furthermore, accor ding to economic statistics, the \nturnover generated by this new branch \u2013building on the prior success of fitness\u2013 was \nstupendous. 91  I thus wondered what could motivate contemporary c onsumers to be so \ntaken in by this new fad.    \n \nIn parallel, I was reminded of the long-standing tr adition of \u201cbody cultivation\u201d [K\u00f6rperkultur] \nin Germany emerging as early as the mid-19 th  century. This aspect then led me to question \nhow this historical trajectory might have condition ed the readiness of contemporary German \nconsumers to assimilate a brand of health managemen t that heavily feeds off many of the \nthemes that were already raised in the course of th e 20 th  century. 92  Indeed, the enthusiastic \nadoption of fitness and wellness in Germany may be read as a form of catching up or as a \ncompensatory measure to modernise the body, after t he failure of previous attempts \u2013from \nthe disciplining of industrial bodies to a perverse  focus on racially naturalised bodies. \nConcretely, in the late modern German context, fitn ess and wellness offer seemingly more \nindividualised and less threatening methods of disc iplining the body. These self-designing \nstrategies can be used irrespective of consumers\u2019 i deological background in order to comply \nwith an underlying \u201cneo-Protestant\u201d ethic of everyd ay life management that still privileges \nefficient streamlining. Thus, as briefly mentioned in my introduction, I developed my \nworking hypothesis around Germany 93  after having briefly assessed the indigenous marke t \ntrajectory of body-related technological developmen ts in comparison with other European \ncountries.   \n \nIn the course of this assessment, I noted that fitn ess and its implements had been readily \nassimilated in the whole of Europe, including in th e newly liberalised Eastern economies. \nThis was reflected most obviously in the straightfo rward linguistic adoption of the term in \nvirtually every European language but also in simil arities within official and corporate health \npolicies as well as in the range of commodities and  services generally offered in these \nmarkets. Wellness on the other hand, met with varyi ng success in the late 1990s-early \n2000s. In Switzerland (as mentioned above), as well  as in Austria and North-Western Europe \n(that is mainly Britain and Scandinavia) the concep t seemed to be relatively ubiquitous. Until \nrecently, however, other countries such as France o r Spain, seemed rather reluctant to \nadopt the buzzword even if many aspects of the tren d were readily incorporated into \ncontemporary \u201cbody management\u201d without the benefit of an overarching label or \nideology. 94  In France, for example, since the 1980s, spas and seaside resorts have been \n                                                 \n91  Cf. Chapter 1 ( Introduction ) for a short discussion on the volume of the welln ess market in the early 2000s. \n92  I discuss some of the historical aspects of fitnes s and wellness in relation with Germany in Chapter 4 \n(History ).  \n93  More specifically, I have focused on former West G ermany before reunification and on the entire Repub lic \nafter reunification. \n94  For instance, in the early 2000s, any personal inq uiries about the popularity of wellness in France w ithin a \nbroad circle of French researchers and acquaintance s invariably led to the following counter-question:  \u201cmais \nc\u2019est quoi le \u2018ouellness\u2019?\u201d.  One can perhaps argue that countries with a Latin culture generally tend to show \nmore linguistic scepticism and cultural resistance when it comes to adopting Anglo-Saxon terminology a nd \ntrends. Another hypothesis could be a more overt re sistance to body disciplining or the existence of s uch an \nimplicit culture of well-being  in southern European countries \u2013evident in the wor ship of good food and subtle \nfragrances, the recourse to traditional remedies or  the practice of \u201cfarniente\u201d...\u2013 that a theoretical  \nconceptualisation of wellness may simply seem super fluous. But these are just speculations\u2026 Italy seem s to \nhave translated wellness into the more locally comp rehensible \u201ebenessere\u201c but I do not know if it comp letely \noverlaps with the wellness constellation as envisio ned further north. Cf. e.g. \u201cDalla salute al beness ere: i 32 \n \nwitnessing the soaring popularity of \u201ctalassoth\u00e9rap ie\u201d \u2013a type of spa therapy based on the \nbenefits of seawater and maritime climate as well a s various types of massage, cosmetic \ntreatments, healthy diet and some movement\u2013 not to mention other holistic body therapies. \nAs in other manifestations of wellness, however, th alassoth\u00e9rapie is not really revolutionary \nsince \u201ctaking the waters\u201d has as rich a tradition i n France as in other European countries. The \nsituation seems rather different in Eastern Europea n countries, where until the early 2000s, \nwellness did not really seem to have found a niche.  At this point, it is still too early to tell \nwhether this was due to an understandable time lag (the more \u201cluxurious\u201d or \u201cesoteric\u201d \ntenets of wellness \u2013as opposed to the more straight forward fitness postulates\u2013 would \nobviously not be a priority in economies bearing th e brunt of a difficult transition) or \nwhether there are also deeper cultural undercurrent s that might have initially hindered its \nadoption in these countries. 95   \n \nThus on the basis of these findings \u2013not to mention  more obvious practical reasons such as \nthe physical and linguistic accessibility of source s\u2013 I decided to focus on Germany because of \nits particular body history and its enthusiastic re ception of both fitness and wellness \ntechnologies. However, even though I have primarily  focused on Germany, whenever \nappropriate in the course of my narrative, I have a lso freely drawn on sources from the \nwider German-speaking community, that is mainly Aus tria and the (Swiss)-German speaking \npart of Switzerland where developments have often e volved in close connection, due to \ncultural bonds influenced by both language and medi a. 96   \n \nThis said, I should however emphasise that the Nort h American context has provided a \nwelcome and necessary counterpoint in my examinatio n of both fitness and wellness, since \nthese phenomena cannot be divorced from the quasi p ermanent cross-pollination that took \nand still takes place between both sides of the Atl antic. Indeed, throughout the 19 th  and 20 th  \ncenturies, one observes striking parallelisms betwe en the two locations, often with a time \nlag. In the earlier days, Europe seems to have take n the lead in terms of healthy sporting \ndevelopments whereas, especially since WWII, North America now often seems to be \n                                                                                                                                                         \ncontributi istituzionali\u201d, online: http://archivio.pubblica.istruzione.it/essere_benes sere/salute3.shtml  [website \naccessed Aug. 2011] \n95  My current knowledge of this context is extremely limited. However, wellness seems to be gradually le aving \nits mark, at least in terms of tourism offers. Cf. e.g. \u201cThe fitness and wellness industry is also gro wing in eastern \nEurope!\u201d, Fitness Tribune , 84, June-July 2003, pp. 22-23, online: \nhttp://www.fitnesstribune.com/arc/ift84_1.htm ; Merholz, Anne-Christine & Schulze, Kristin \u201eEntsp annen in \nOsteuropa: Luxus-Wellness f\u00fcr den schmalen Geldbeut el\u201c, Bild , 30.02.2008, online: \nhttp://www.bild.de/reise/2008/schmal/wellness-in-os teuropa-4113992.bild.html ; or \u201cSlovakia: Wellness is the \nword in the alps of the east\u201d, The Independent , 20.09.2009, online: \nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/slovakia -wellness-is-the-word-in-the-alps-of-the-east-\n1790281.html : \u201cThe term \"wellness\" is widely used in the High Tat ras\u201d . Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind \nthat what may represent an attractively cheap alter native for western visitors or the new eastern Euro pean \nelite most probably remains an unattainable luxury for the average eastern European consumer. The link  \nbetween wellness and purchasing power is discussed for the case of the former East German territory, \nironically emphasising the danger of prejudices and  foregone conclusions, without coming to definite \nconclusions in the following: Dassler, Anna, \u201cAyurv eda und Hartz IV. Rainald Grebe besingt die Ostdeut schen \nWellnessregionen\u201d, Weichsp\u00fcler in Kunst und Konsum,  Querformat , op. cit., pp. 90-95. [websites accessed Aug. \n2011] \n96  Even if institutionalised health-care structures d isplay considerable national variations, media \ninterpenetration between the three countries is wel l-established through newspapers (e.g. the German w eekly \nDie Zeit  or the Swiss daily Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung  can count on a readership that spills over into th e neighbouring \ncountries), TV channels, as well as transnational p ublishing and distribution structures.  33 \n \nproviding the seminal impulses \u2013in fact so much so that the casual European observer may \nbe tempted to dismiss both fitness and wellness as purely American fads. 97  This perception \nthus mirrors the widespread popular impression that  \u201cnovelty\u201d and \u201cprogress\u201d travel mainly \neastwards. But, as I am about to show in the follow ing section as well as in Chapter 4 \n(History ), fitness and wellness are truly transatlantic ide ologies, even if their understanding \nand appropriation have proved differentiated depend ing on the cultural context. 98   \n \nTime frame: why focus on the \u201clate twentieth centur y\u201d? \nThe \u201cLate Twentieth Century\u201d in my dissertation\u2019s t itle points to the time frame of my study. \nI have mainly concentrated on the period spanning f rom the early 1980s to the late 1990s, \ni.e. approximately two decades. I decided to focus on this period because to my mind it \nneatly frames a conscious crystallisation \u2013some mig ht argue for a \u201cturning point\u201d or an \n\u201cacme\u201d\u2013 of many lifestyle health trends that (re-)e merged in the course of the 19 th  century \nand evolved at different paces in the course of the  20 th  century. On the one hand, this \ncrystallisation is characterised by a renewed focus  on the body. As hinted at in Chapter 3 \n(Theory ) and shown in Chapter 5 ( Food Case-study ) and 6 ( Cosmetics Case-Study ), one \nwitnesses a convergence of various interests in bod y design \u2013a body seen both as a source \nand a bearer of identity, an entity with multifario us overlapping needs that can only be met \nby implementing a wide variety of strategies. On th e other hand, the last two decades of the \n20 th  century display a striking, increasingly seamless merger between \u201cnatural\u201d and \n\u201ctechnological\u201d perspectives on body design, two re alms that long appeared unbridgeable. 99  \nLast but not least, the most decisive criterion for  my temporal focus is the transition to a \nquasi-unbridled commercialisation of health and bea uty practices as well as a \ncommodification of health and beauty values \u2013an asp ect I discuss at length in the \n\u201cCommodification\u201d section of Chapter 3 ( Theory ), especially as it pertains to the \n\u201crecombinance\u201d metaphor.  \n \nThis gradual paradigm change was ushered in by tran sformations that would prove crucial \nfor the late modern focus on appropriate body manag ement. From the early 19 th  to the mid-\n20 th  century, the most prominent early developments are :  \n \n\u2022 the emergence of a new vision of sports, emphasisin g individual endeavour as a form \nof personal health promotion and moving away from g roup (or national) cohesion \nand character-building towards the active promotion  of individual achievement, \naesthetics, fun and satisfaction or pleasure. 100   \n                                                 \n97  In my opinion, this is due in no small part to the  linguistic roots of fitness and wellness as overar ching \ncommercial labels. This aspect, however, obscures t he fact that there are a number of closely connecte d \nconcepts in the various European languages that poi nt to similar phenomena such as \u201cbenessere\u201d in Ital ian, \nwhich I have discussed in a prior footnote.   \n98  A good comparative perspective is provided in the following: Fitness as cultural phenomenon , Ed Karin A.

The \nonly book \u2013which I have found\u2013 that tackles some as pects is: Martial Arts in the Modern World , Eds Thomas A. \nGreen & Joseph R. Svinth, Westport (CT) & London: P raeger, 2003. Moreover, I have not been able to acc ess \nany reliable statistics on their dissemination, be it in Germany or western countries. However, martia l arts\u2019 \npopularity in Germany, and more broadly in Europe, can be empirically assessed by surveying the number  of 36 \n \n\u2022 linked to the above, the exponential dissemination of commercial health clubs, gyms, \nstudios, etc. 115   \n\u2022 the consolidation and mainstreaming of a bicephalou s trend in the field of cosmetics \nwith \u201csci-tech\u201d goods on the one hand and \u201cnatural\u201d  products on the other, even \nthough their intrinsic nature can be contested and the divide between them is \nincreasingly and consciously bridged by a number of  cosmetic companies. 116  \n\u2022 the ready availability (and increasing affordabilit y) of high-tech health appliances that \ncan be enrolled in everyday body practices (e.g. pu lse or body fat monitors).  \n\u2022 a more widespread acceptance of invasive cosmetic t reatment and surgery enrolled \nto custom-design bodies. 117  \n \nHaving sweepingly and superficially condensed a num ber of trends here, I should however \nemphasise that many of them have earlier roots than  suggested by my chronology. For \nexample, a heightened interest in dieting fads can be detected in the 19 th  century already. 118  \nSimilarly, an early \u201cfitness\u201d craze can be detected  in the course of the 1970s in Germany \nwith the very popular Trimm Dich  programme. 119  But there again a less myopic glance takes \n                                                                                                                                                         \ndojos or studios offering a variety of traditional and hybrid/modern arts, cf. e.g. the databank of \nhttp://www.kampfkunst.de/  under \u201cDOJOS\u201d and \u201cn. Stilen\u201d, there I have counte d 5167 listed dojos. In contrast, \nthere were only 2305 dojos listed on http://www.kampfkunst-\nboard.info/index.php?page=schulen&bk_land=1&bk_choi ce=land . The discrepancy between figures provided \ncan be explained by the fact that different discipl ines were included (or not), that a number of dojos  are not \nregistered in these directories (my former karate a nd aikido dojos appear on neither...) and the fact that these \nnon-official websites cannot be expected to list ev ery martial art and associated dojos as well as upd ate them \nregularly. Even martial arts associations cannot be  counted on as comprehensive sources since, there a gain, \nmany styles hence dojos are not affiliated with an \u201cofficial\u201d association. Furthermore many associatio ns include \nmore than one discipline: there are e.g. 62 associa tions listed under \u201ckarate\u201d here: \nhttp://www.kampfkunst.de/verband/verbaendemKarate.c fm . Nevertheless, even these rather nebulous \nfigures do provide some measure of martial art popu larity in Germany. As to yoga, even though it is ju st as \ndifficult to estimate the current number of practit ioners in Germany \u2013for reasons similar to those lis ted above \nfor martial arts, there is at least considerably mo re literature to be obtained: cf. e.g. Baier, Karl,  Yoga auf dem \nWeg nach Westen , W\u00fcrzburg: K\u00f6nigshausen & Neumann, 1998 [a history  of yoga reception from Antiquity to \nthe 1930s], De Michelis, Elizabeth, A History of Mo dern Yoga, London & New York: Continuum, 2005 [a hi story \nof modern yoga from the 18 th  to the 20 th  century]; Singleton, Mark, Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture \nPractice , Oxford & New York: Oxford University Press, 2010 [a more controversial history of modern posture \npractice seen as the product of a broad and rather recent cultural admixture];  A more popular overvie w is \nprovided in: Cushman, Anne, \u201cThe New Yoga\u201d, Yoga Journal , no date, online edition available here: \nhttp://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/281 . [websites accessed Aug. 2011]   \n115  However, it should be born in mind that commercial  clubs [Turnanstalten] \u2013i.e. boasting no overt poli tical or \nreligious affiliation\u2013 were already being founded i n Germany in the 1820s and were well disseminated b y the \n1930s, with many entrepreneurs even boasting fitnes s franchises in many countries.

I n the course of these years, one \nwitnesses the crystallisation of a new vision, the vision of a holistic body perceived as a locus \nof individual expertise and pro-active agency harne ssed to consciously construct the self \nwithin a culture increasingly defined by consumptio n and the conscious creation of \nindividual lifestyles: \n  \nBy providing a series of \u201aexpert knowledges\u2018, for i nstance in relation to lifestyle, health, \nfashion and beauty, consumer culture is understood from a postmodern perspective to have \ncontributed to an increasingly reflexive understand ing of the self, an awareness that identity \nis chosen and constructed. As Giddens (1991) has poi nted out, the self in \u2018late modernity\u2019 has \nbecome a reflexive project; it is created (and re-c reated) through a plurality of consumer \nchoices and lifestyle decisions. In his view, indiv iduals can now draw on a wide repertoire of \nsymbolic goods with which to fashion and display th eir own identities. According to \nFeatherstone (1991a), the \u2018new heroes\u2019 of consumer culture display their individuality in the \n                                                                                                                                                         \n(WZB), Februar 2005.

Zur Geschichte der Kommerziellen Fitnes sanbieter\u201c, Fitness: Sch\u00f6nheit kommt von aussen , op. cit., \np. 43: \u201eSo ging die Fitnessbranche der Zeit um 1900 mit ei nem K\u00f6rperbild hausieren, das auch die Funktion ein es \nAlltagsratgebers besass und Lebensstilelemente verm ittelte. Dabei hofften die Sportschulenbesitzer und  die \nAutoren der Fitnessbrosch\u00fcren  zwar auch auf einen steigenden Umsatz, wen sie betonten, dass die Aus\u00fcb ung \neines Trainingssystems  gleichzeitig auch half, den  Alltag generell zu bew\u00e4ltigen und noch dazu Erfolg  im Leben \nzu haben.

But why did I focus on food \nand cosmetics in my case-studies instead of on fitn ess merchandising or the alpine wellness \nresort boom? \n \nFood and cosmetics as healthy lifestyle technologie s  \nThere are, of course, a number of angles I could ha ve chosen in order to apprehend the \ncontemporary impact of fitness and wellness \u2013includ ing the above. For example, authors \nsuch as e.g. Jennifer Maguire 123  or Roberta Sassatelli 124  have provided us with seminal \nstudies on the more straightforward \u201cphysical cultu re\u201d aspect of fitness, as it is practised in \nhealth clubs or gyms. But in my case-studies, I dec ided to focus on food and cosmetics \nprecisely because they did not emerge with either f itness or wellness. As key domains of \neveryday life \u2013which, admittedly, are also linked t o the more or less conscious cultivation of \nthe body\u2013 they function as good barometers to gauge  the quasi-ubiquitous penetration of \nthese ideologies and provide us with a much broader  picture of their stakes.  125   \n \nCompared to more obvious \u201csocial identity goods\u201d su ch as sports cars or designer dresses, \nwhich have long lost a purely functional associatio n with mobility and protection in order to \ncatalyse distinction, food and cosmetics may not in itially strike one as quintessential \n\u201clifestyle products\u201d. However when considering the findings of my case-studies and taking \ninto account the definition provided by Mika Pantza r, the link may appear more obvious:    \n \n [\u2026] lifestyle products are purposefully created fo r specific lifestyles by explicit marketing \nefforts [\u2026] lifestyle products are historical outco mes of transformation processes where \nfunctions of goods change in time. Original needs a nd functions of products transform when \nproducts diffuse widely, and when consumers and pro ducers meet each other. [\u2026] a lifestyle \nproduct tends to integrate different practices, act ors and material objects in one site and \nplace (or product), both on a microscopic level of individual household and on the \nmacroscopic level of society. 126   \n \n                                                 \n122  Jagger, Elizabeth, \u201cConsumer Bodies\u201d, in: The Body, Culture and Society: an introduction , Eds Philip Hancock, \nBill Hughes, Elizabeth Jagger & al., Buckingham & P hiladelphia: Open University Press, 2000, p. 52  \n123  Cf. Maguire, Jennifer Smith, op. cit. \n124  Cf. Sassatelli, Roberta, op. cit., pp. 3-4.. Rober ta Sassatelli wishes it to clearly distinguish her venture from \nthat of Barry Glassner or the aforementioned Jennif er Maguire in that her aim is to provide an ethnogr aphic \nnarrative of lived culture \u201cto account for the live d experiences \u2013of fun and frustration- of fitness g yms\u2019 \nparticipants\u201d.

[unpublished] 39 \n \nPantzar\u2019s definition first implies that lifestyle p roducts are the fruit of a conscious \nconceptualisation that is steered by marketers \u2013as obvious in the shower gel discourses I \nquoted in Chapter 1 ( Introduction ). But these efforts do not take place in a cultura l void: new \nproduct meanings must build onto older meanings in order to modify them. This is \nparticularly obvious in the case of food, where con temporary advertising discourse is replete \nwith references to past diets and tastes but usuall y emphasises the need for new (usually \nlighter) products. Moreover, the wide \u2013increasingly  global\u2013 commercial dissemination of \nfood and cosmetics also means that the arena of int erpretation around them grows to \ninclude the perspectives of a number of actors, i.e . not just producers\u2019 visions but also those \nof various mediators, such as lifestyle magazines, and, even more crucially, those of \nconsumers. Thus, in order to establish economically  fruitful communication between \nproducers and consumers, mediation has to build on the cultural capital and experience of \nconsumers, linking (and contrasting) their previous  practices with older products to new \nproducts and practices. As Pantzar puts it: \u201cOne important passage point of product \nmeanings moving from producers to consumers (and oc casionally from consumers to \nproducers) is the  mediasphere  where both consumers and producers \u2018learn\u2019 about m odern \nlifestyle .127  The media sphere thus reflects continuities but als o disruptions or tensions in the \nnegotiation of new trends. 128   \n \nIn this sense, the trajectories of food and cosmeti cs are particularly emblematic. In the case \nof food, meanings have evolved considerably: a trad itional orientation has been gradually \nreplaced by an exotic curiosity as well as the \u201cnee d\u201d for convenience, functional and natural \nproducts, reflecting increasingly taxing lifestyles . Cosmetics were much earlier embedded in \nlifestyle issues since preserving the health and be auty of the skin has long been perceived as \na multifaceted enterprise but, even in this case, a  discourse and image analysis uncovers the \nincreasing tension between rationally disciplined s kincare and a more pampering \napproach. 129  Finally, beyond the fitness and wellness dimension s, food and cosmetics have \nproved to be key fields to analyse the merging of t echnology, commodification and \nembodied consciousness under the sign of the body \u2013 four dimensions I analyse closely in the \nfollowing Theory  chapter.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n127  Pantzar, Mika, ibid., p. 8.

Moreover, the geog raphical context (Germany) is relatively \ncontained. However, the decision to frame my study at the crossroads between four vast \ndomains \u2013body, technology, commodification and cons ciousness- necessarily entails that I \nwill neither be able to draw on a homogeneous set o f theoretical backgrounds, nor do \njustice to the large bodies of literature generated  in each of these realms. Moreover, my \nframework will necessarily have to be transdiscipli nary since the body, technology, \ncommodification or consciousness have never been th e sole province of a particular \ndiscipline. Indeed, history, sociology, anthropolog y, and philosophy, to name but a few, all \nboast fertile \u2013if sometimes relatively young\u2013 tradi tions in these fields. I will therefore use the \nwords of my title as a thread to lead the way into the heterogeneous theoretical framing of \nmy study.  \n \nAnother important caveat I should mention before ex amining \u201cunder the sign of the body\u201d, \n\u201ctechnology\u201d, \u201ccommodification\u201d and \u201cembodied consc iousness\u201d is that, due to the focus of \nmy dissertation, these fields are very densely inte rtwined. Indeed, the construction of my \ntitle suggests that the three last terms are subord inated or at least coloured by the first one: \n\u201cthe sign of the body\u201d. It is thus difficult to def ine one of the domains without at least \nalluding to the other(s) since, by ascribing them t o a sign, I aim to show how the \nconcreteness of bodies, technology and consumption \u2013in a sense the hardware\u2013 is \nflavoured, steered and made slippery by a symbolic quest for \u201chealthy\u201d meaning or at least \nsense-building. Commodification, for instance, take s on a special aura when linked to the \nbody: even without going to the extremes of slavery  or venal sex, the extreme marketing of \nbodily health is still perceived as ethically distu rbing if not obscene. Furthermore, radical \ncommodification is hardly conceivable outside of a (post-)industrial, hence technology-\nintensive everyday realm. And bodies in the late mo dern period have merged so \nconspicuously and inextricably with (high)-technolo gy 131  that explaining the former without \n                                                 \n130  Physiologie und industrielle Gesellschaft: Studien zur Verwissenschaftlichung des K\u00f6rpers im 19. und 2 0. \nJahrhundert , Eds Philipp Sarasin & Jakob Tanner, Frankfurt a/M ain: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1998, p. 20: \u201c Because the \nbody is unable to express itself verbally, all huma ns require a language in order to communicate what pertains \nto it, what they associate with it, what affects th em as it is mediated by bodily perceptions and sens ations.\u201d  \n131  Of course, one can argue that during humankind\u2019s e ntire (pre-)history, technology has always been use d to \nmodify and condition the body: e.g. earrings, neck- rings, scalp shaping, circumcision and genital shap ing or \nmutilation, piercing, scarification etc. as well as  all manner of bodily disciplines including hunting , sailing, \nagricultural or warfare techniques, etc. However, w hat is meant here is what \u2013from our limited perspec tive at \nleast\u2013 can be described as a more ubiquitous, commo dified and relatively mindless relationship with \nindustrially-produced everyday technologies (such a s computers, toothbrushes or shoes) on the one hand  and, 41 \n \nreferring to the latter has become simply impossibl e, just as it has become difficult to \nseparate technology from its experiential ramificat ions, or debates around the body as sign \nor text from discussions about embodied consciousne ss. I will nevertheless try to make the \narticulations between these fields as clear as poss ible.  \n \nTo some extent, I would also like to belie the Theory heading of this chapter. Indeed, even \nthough I will be drawing on a number of theoretical  sources to develop useful definitions, \ninterpretations and analytical strategies and categ ories, the following sub-chapters will also \ninclude a number of contemporary examples or mini c ase-studies to illustrate points \nwhenever appropriate, especially in the \u201cCommodific ation\u201d section. Besides contributing to \na less stodgy narrative, this strategy is aimed at assessing current developments, before \nmoving on to a historical contextualisation that wi ll be provided in Chapter 4 ( History ) as well \nas to Chapters 5 ( Food Case-Study ) and 6 ( Cosmetics Case-Study ). My initial shunning of \nhistorical depth should not be read as an attempt t o subsequently impose contemporary or \nseemingly a-historical categories and rationales on  historical material instead of evolving \ncategories and rationales empirically through a slo w accretion of findings. Rather, because \nmy moorings are self-consciously transdiciplinary a nd thus entail a potentially dangerous \nblurring of definitions, theoretical references and  analytical tools, I want the reader to be \naware of the particular situative elements of my st udy before applying fuzzy concepts \nindiscriminately upon historical sources.  \n \nOn a more personal note, as a transdisciplinary res earcher, history primarily matters to me \nwhen I can relate it to contemporary developments a nd questionings. The sequence of my \ntext thus reflects the sequence of my intellectual enquiry into the health field: I first became \naware of fitness and wellness through a personal an d contemporary encounter. The \nproducts on my supermarket shelves, the flyers in m y letter box, the articles in so many \nnewspapers, conversations with friends, private hea lth challenges, etc. were the elements \nthat motivated my research. Only subsequently, did I deepen a superficial awareness of the \nhistorical roots because I wanted to know where all  this \u201cbody madness\u201d stemmed from and \nhow it had evolved.  \n \nUnder the sign of the body  \n \nThere are many different (and even conflicting) rea sons for the resurrection of the body as a \nsite of diverse and almost devotional attention in contemporary culture. It can be explained \nas a product of social conformity (to acquire certa in socially endorsed and well-advertised \nbody forms) but also as the result of heightened in dividualism. It can be seen as the gift of \ntechnological freedom but also as a reaction to our  technological enslavement and our \nconsequent fear of body atrophy. Loss of religious sentiment is no doubt a major cause of the \nbody boom, but heightened religious interest is als o responsible for much of the New Age \nfascination with somatics, particularly with Asian approaches. 132    \n \nWhy has the westernized world become so obsessed wi th bodies and their management? In \nthe above quote, Richard Shusterman enumerates some  of the most popular reasons that \n                                                                                                                                                         \non the other, the increasingly self-reflexive recou rse to so-called high-tech procedures to consciousl y modify, \nenhance or even design the body such as plastic sur gery, IVF or gene therapy. In both cases, I would c ontend \nthat in westernised late modern economies, these te chnological webs have become increasingly difficult  to \nescape since they even encroach on the conception a nd antenatal phases.  \n132  Shusterman, Richard, Performing Live , Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 2000 , p. 157. 42 \n \nare commonly put forth both in the European and the  North American media as well as \nscholarly contributions. 133  There is no doubt that all of these factors do con tribute to the \nbody phenomenon and I will try to unravel how they are articulated into a new body ethic. \nBut I will also emphasise the historical continuiti es and disruptions underlying this \ndevelopment, showing that most of these ideas have roots that can be traced back to the \nalternative health movements of the early 20 th  century or the hygienic theories of the late \n18 th  and 19 th  centuries that exploited concepts already promoted  during the Enlightenment -\nthus harkening back to motifs rooted in Antiquity o r even beyond. \n \nIndeed, at this point it should be emphasised that,  historically and sociologically speaking, \nthe only characteristic constant in the perception and treatment of the body seems to be \nflux: \n \nIn sum, the body has been, and still is, constructe d in almost as many ways as there are \nindividuals; it seems to be all things to all peopl e. Thus the body is defined as good and bad, \ntomb and temple, machine and garden, cloak and pris on, sacred and secular, friend and \nenemy, cosmic and mystical, one with mind and soul or separate, private or public, personal \nor the property of the state, clock or car, to vary ing degrees plastic, bionic, communal, \nselected from a catalogue or engineered, a corpse o r the self. Any construction of the body, \nhowever, is also a construction of the self as embo died; and as such influences not only how \nthe body is treated but also life is lived. Some lo ve the body, some hate it; some hide it, some \nflaunt it; some \u2018bruise\u2019 it (Saint Paul) and others  pamper it with \u2018nice, large pike and good \nRhine wine\u2019 (Luther). One may be a libertine or a p uritan, a mechanic or a gardener. Indeed \nthe implications are immense, affecting virtually a ll areas of one\u2019s life. 134   \n \nAnthony Synott states that \u201cIn sum, the body has no intrinsic meaning.\u201d  135  So why focus on \nthe sign  of the body if the body itself means everything an d nothing? Is it not a waste of \ntime?  But Synott goes on to conclude that \u201cPopulations create their own meanings, and thus \ntheir own bodies; but how they create, and then cha nge them, and why, reflects the social \nbody.\u201d 136  Thus, in the context of my dissertation, both \u201cbod y\u201d and \u201csign\u201d are central, since \nthey refer to the tension between an entity that ca n both perceive and be perceived \nsensorially \u2013i.e. see/n, hear/d, touch/ed, smell/ed  and even taste/d- without the mediation \nof words, but also as a bearer or crystallisation o f socially significant information or symbols \nthat can be, so to speak, read off it. 137  This tension seems to lead to the following dilemm a: \n \n[\u2026] either the human body is conceived wholly in te rms of Nature and, in its universal \ngivenness, to be of no interest to sociology or his tory; or the human body is understood \n                                                 \n133  Cf. e.g. The Body: Social Process and Cultural Theory , op. cit.

The struggle has \nproved all the more bitter because semiotics 141  has provided an extremely stimulating \ntheoretical impetus, especially in the body realm a s apprehended by feminist or gender \nstudies. 142  At stake here is the rift between essentialist (bi ological) and social-symbolic \n(textual) theories of gender constitution. The latt er have provided a very strong impetus for \nfeminist movements in the political arena, while al so spawning \u201cqueer theory\u201d.

But in the 20th century it was \nparticularly expounded upon by the likes of Heidegg er or Gadamer and more recently Apel and Habermas. In \nparallel, a number of Anglo-Saxon and French thinke rs have been influenced by or have wrestled with li nguistic \nturn concepts, e.g. Richard Rorty, Jacques Derrida as well a number of feminist scholars such as Judit h Butler, \nLuce Irigaray or Julia Kristeva. Cf. e.g. Lafont, C ristina, The Linguistic Turn in Hermeneutic Philosophy , Boston: \nMIT Press, 1999 & Rorty, Richard, The Linguistic Turn , Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992. In a nutshell, \nthe linguistic turn can be summed up as the realisa tion that language does not describe the world and the \nexperience of the subject in the world but actually  structures and constitutes them. Consequently, in Rorty\u2019s \nwords, it would seem to imply that \u201c[..] philosophical problems are problems which may  be solved (or dissolved) \neither by reforming language or by understanding mo re about the language we presently use.\u201d  In: Rorty, \nRichard, op. cit., p. 3.  \n140  Suggesting the concept of \u201cembodiment\u201d as e.g. dev eloped from a phenomenological perspective \n(perception) by Maurice Merleau-Ponty or from an an thropological slant (practice) by Pierre Bourdieu. \nHowever \u201cembodiment\u201d and its relationship with the subject will be examined in more detail in the \u201cEmb odied \nConsciousness\u201d section of this chapter. \n141  For a good and compact overview of the field, cf. Chandler, Daniel, Semiotics for Beginners: Introduction , \nonline ( http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem01.htm l ): \u201cSemiotics began to become a major \napproach to cultural studies in the late 1960s, par tly as a result of the work of Roland Barthes. The translation \ninto English of his popular essays in a collection entitled Mythologies (Barthes 1957), followed in th e 1970s and \n1980s by many of his other writings, greatly increa sed scholarly awareness of this approach. Writing i n 1964, \nBarthes declared that 'semiology aims to take in an y system of signs, whatever their substance and lim its; \nimages, gestures, musical sounds, objects, and the complex associations of all of these, which form th e content \nof ritual, convention or public entertainment: thes e constitute, if not languages, at least systems of  signification' \n(Barthes 1967, 9). The adoption of semiotics in Bri tain was influenced by its prominence in the work o f the \nCentre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS) at the University of Birmingham whilst the centre was under \nthe direction of the neo-Marxist sociologist Stuart  Hall (director 1969-79). Although semiotics may be  less \ncentral now within cultural and media studies (at l east in its earlier, more structuralist form), it r emains \nessential for anyone in the field to understand it.  What individual scholars have to assess, of course , is whether \nand how semiotics may be useful in shedding light o n any aspect of their concerns. Note that Saussure' s term, \n'semiology' is sometimes used to refer to the Sauss urean tradition, whilst 'semiotics' sometimes refer s to the \nPeircean tradition, but that nowadays the term 'sem iotics' is more likely to be used as an umbrella te rm to \nembrace the whole field (N\u00f6th 1990, 14).\u201d [website accessed Aug. 2011]  \n142  However \u201cthe body\u201d as symbolically produced text h as also shown its limits, as in David Reimer\u2019s famo us \ncase. Cf. e.g. \u201cDavid Reimer, 38, Subject of the Jo hn/Joan Case\u201d, New York Times , 12.05.2004, online edition: \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/12/international/ame ricas/12REIM.html?ex=1399694400&en=8f0108b49a \ncb766b&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND . [website accessed Aug. 2011] 44 \n \nThe focus on the body is significant because of its  centrality to feminist discourse. It also \nprovides a critique of Enlightenment philosophy whi ch emphasizes a mind-centered theory \nof knowledge that marginalizes the body as the chie f enemy of objectivity. Although not all \nfeminist discourse acknowledges the body, \u201cwriting the body\u201d is an important aspect of it. In \npromoting dualist oppositions such as culture&natur e, rational/irrational, subject/object, \nand mind/body, and by privileging the first of each  of these oppositions over the other, \nEnlightenment philosophy admits only one vision \u2013 t hat of the constitutive male subject. 143  \n \nMoreover, body-centred research has also enriched t he investigation of virtually all the \narenas of everyday life, such as consumption for ex ample \u2014a field crucial to this study. In \nthis domain, paralleling the design of commodities,  the design of the body (through the use \nof health-enhancing technologies) is not only envis ioned as a way to heighten its functional \npotential (that is as a means to an end). Instead, \u201c[under] the sign of medical and \ntechnological feasibility [the body] became a promi se of eternal youth, beauty, health and \neven eternal life \u2013 a shapeless/shapeable object of  lust. 144  Body design is thus increasingly \nperceived as an end in itself. It transforms the bo dy into an entity that can be customised \naccording to taste or into a signifier 145  that welcomes any  signified  146  (such as health, youth, \nbeauty, etc.) one might want to conjoin it with. Th e increasingly weak link \u2013or even the \ndivorce\u2013 between the body as signifier  and the body as signified  transforms body design into \none of many strategies to shape as well as advertis e identities and lifestyles:  \u201c[The body\u2019s] \nsuperfluity is the pre-condition for its becoming a  commodity. It is the ultimate commodity \nbecause it is the most difficult to obtain.\u201d 147  Indeed, shaping and modifying the body still \nremain more resource-intensive (in terms of time, e nergy and/or money invested) than \nbuying a distinctive hat, dishwasher or stereo. Par adoxically though, it seems that the \n\u201cmediatisation\u201d of bodies \u2013or their use as a form o f \u201cidentity billboard\u201d \u2013 is what has \ntriggered more interest in their \u201creality\u201d among th e social sciences: \n \nOddly, a sociology of the body has emerged at the v ery moment in which the human reality \nof the body seems to have diminished in significanc e or even dissolved into a confusing flux \nof partial experiences. In fact, we might suppose t hat the body has become available as a \n                                                 \n143  Cf.

For a compact ov erview of the Saussurian sign, cf. Steve Hoenisch\u2019s  article \nhere: \u201cSaussure\u2019s sign\u201d, 18.11.2005, online: http://www.criticism.com/md/the_sign.html#section-T HE-SIGN,-\nTHE-SIGNIFIER,-AND-THE-SIGNIFIED . [website accessed Aug. 2011] \n146  The signified refers to the plane of content, i.e.  the subject matter, concept, thought, etc. Cf. pre vious \nfootnote. \n147  Pauser, Wolfgang, & Penz, Otto, Sch\u00f6nheit des K\u00f6rpers: ein theoretischer Streit \u00fcbe r Bodybuilding, Di\u00e4t und \nSch\u00f6nheitschirurgie.  Wien: Rhombus Verlag, 1995, p. 75. 45 \n \nsociological topic only to the extent that it is co nceptualized as something other than a living \nhuman presence.  148   \n \nIn that sense, Harvie Ferguson\u2019s interpretation of the birth of body sociology concurs with \nRichard Shusterman\u2019s assessment of the body-media i ssue: \u201cDespite mediatic \ndematerialization, bodies seem to matter more\u201d .149  But the latter\u2019s diagnosis goes further \nsince he confronts external media with the body per ceived as a medium: \n \n\u2026the media revolution so transformed the notions of  medium and reality that our body \u2013 \nformerly declassed as merely a medium of, or means to, the real (hence subordinate, \nreflective, distortive) \u2013 now gets elevated, as our  central medium, to the status of \nconstructor and locus of the real. Hence it becomes  a real value in itself. Once reality is seen \nas a construction, the media that construct it can no longer be disdained. 150  \n \nNevertheless, even if the media have created a priv ileged space for bodies to reassert \ncontrol over reality construction, bodies cannot co mpletely relinquish their function as \nchannels. Their makeover definitely influences worl d-building but they are in turn defined \nand controlled by broader force fields such as disc ourses, social relations and practices \u2013\nfrom within and without the media\u2013 which often impe de the development of a cohesive \nidentity. Moreover, by staging bodies as sites of p ermanent modification and amelioration, \nthe media may have permanently blurred the boundari es between fiction and reality, \nbetween signifier and signified  just as they have contributed to further adulterat e neat \ndistinctions between \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201ccultural/techno logical\u201d bodies. \n \nThus, just as it is inescapable in any historical s tudy, the media question is central to my \ndissertation. However, trailing a slippery body (or  rather its ambiguous signs) through the \n1980s and 1990s in order to historicize it today pr esents me with an additional challenge, \nsince I have decided to explicitly associate the bo dy with three other dimensions. By \ndefinition, the object of my research, the \u201cbody-te chnology-commodification-\nconsciousness\u201d nexus of this period, is no longer d irectly accessible in its contemporary \nform/s so I have to rely on the media to try and re capture at least some of the salient \naspects of this constellation. As can be inferred f rom my analysis until now, my media \nsources will present me with signs, or rather signifiers  of the bodies, technologies, \nconsumption practices and states of mind prevailing  and changing over a certain period. But, \njust as with most body images in today\u2019s media, I w ill have no way of ascertaining what are \nthe actual signifieds  lurking behind these signifiers. I will therefore have to rely on \nconvergences between various media signifiers in the hope of accessing at least a form of \n\u201cculture concentrate\u201d 151  that might provide a plausible outline of the signifieds  involved. \nHowever, it is not just in terms of sources that pr oviding a history of the body is problematic. \nFerguson sees the challenge in terms of finding app ropriate theoretical resources or an \nanalytic framework to interpret historical developm ents connected to the body: \n \n                                                 \n148  Ferguson, Harvie, op. cit., p. 22. \n149  Shusterman, Richard, op. cit., p. 137. \n150  Ibid., p. 144. \n151  As far as I am aware, the expression was coined by  Kathrin Bonacker in her book Hyperk\u00f6rper in der \nAnzeigenwerbung des 20. Jahrhunderts , op. cit. The question of sources has been broache d more in-depth in \nChapter 2 ( Methodology) . 46 \n \nThus in spite of recent influential developments (w hich in fact owe more to the highly \noriginal and important works of Norbert Elias and M ichel Foucault than they do to the \noriginating works of modern sociological traditions ), a historical understanding of modern \nforms of embodiment remains to be fully developed a nd is, perhaps, best approached \nindirectly through philosophical and scientific mov ements that are themselves grounded in \nsuch images. 152  \n \nThis is the eclectic strategy I have chosen in orde r to buttress the theoretical \u201cbody \nframework\u201d of my dissertation, since I have freely drawn on the traditions bequeathed by \nMarcel Mauss, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Maur ice Merleau-Ponty, etc. (and \ncriticised/modified by their heirs), recent inputs from the philosophy of science, the social \nstudies of science and technology or STS traditions , from Bruno Latour, through Don Ihde, to \nDonna Haraway and Judy Wajcman, and feminist/gender  scholarship including Mary \nDouglas, Anne Balsamo or collective ventures. 153  But I did not neglect the more sociologically \nflavoured writings of Pierre Bourdieu, Jean Baudril lard, Mike Featherstone, Bryan Turner or \nUlrich Beck. However, in terms of historical unders tanding, I am tempted to agree with \nFerguson in the sense that even if I do draw on a n umber of historians of (public) health and \nmedicine for my historical contextualisation of bod y management in Chapter 4  (History) , I \nhave rarely encountered a very self-reflexive theor etical embedding in these studies.  \n \nBut I cannot discount at least one crucial technolo gical-historical contribution on the history \nof the body between 1765 and 1914, namely that of P hilipp Sarasin with his book \u201cReizbare \nMaschinen\u201d  [Excitable Machines]. 154  His study aims at spotlighting hygienic thought fr om the \nlegacy of the Enlightenment\u2019s Encyclop\u00e9die (as compiled by Diderot and & d\u2019Alembert in \n1765) to the decline of its central tenets, or rath er just before their sinister hijacking by \neugenic (or racial-hygienic) ideologies at the dawn  of the 20th century. Sarasin begins his \nstudy with the provocative question \u201cDoes the body have a history?\u201d 155  And by the end of \nthe first paragraph, he has concluded that, yes, in dividual bodies do have a history (they are \nborn, grow, age and die) and so does our genotype i n terms of evolution (climatic \n                                                 \n152  Ferguson, Harvie, op. cit., p. 22. \n153  Such as Our Bodies, Our Ourselves: a book by and for women,  Ed.

In recent years this question has been echoed by a number of \nhistorians. Cf. e.g. Duden, Barbara, op. cit., p. 8 : \u201eUm an die innere, also unsichtbare Leibhaftigkeit dieser \nklagenden Frauen heranzukommen, musste ich mich als  Historikerin \u00fcber eine Grenze wagen, jene Grenze \nn\u00e4mlich, die den K\u00f6rper und insbesondere das K\u00f6rper innere hinter der Haut von der umgebenden Umwelt \nscheidet und sie epistemologisch, wissenschaftsgesc hichtlich, mentalit\u00e4tsgeschichtlich in gegens\u00e4tzlic hen \nDom\u00e4nen verwiesen hat: hier der K\u00f6rper, die \u201eNatur\u201c , die \u201eBiologie\u201c, dort die soziale Umwelt, die Gesc hichte. \nHier jene letztlich unver\u00e4nderbar vorgestellte Leib lichkeit \u201edes Menschen\u201c, dort das weite Feld des \nGeschichtlichen in seiner grunds\u00e4tzlichen Wandelbar keit. Diese Grenzziehung hat historisch sowohl den K\u00f6rper \naus der Geschichte herauskatapultiert als auch die Vorstellung \u00fcber ihn als einen blinden Fleck jensei ts des \nRandes der sozialhistorischen Perspektive unerhellt  gelassen.\u201c  And Leslie Addelson meditating on the same \nquestion, exclaims: \u201cAnd yet what is history if not the accounts of hum an bodies in and over time? History \nwithout bodies is unimaginable. How odd then that t he grand abstraction of history would seem to oblit erate \nthe very concrete stuff of which it is made. But ju st how concrete or real are  the bodies of history?\u201d  Cf. Adelson, \nLeslie A, Making Bodies, Making History: Feminism and German Identity , Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, \n1993, p. 1. Over, the following pages, she then goe s on to retrace the intellectual history and philos ophy of the \nbody in the twentieth century history, pertinently analysing the shortcomings and contradictions of in puts by \nthe Frankfurt School, Foucault, deconstruction and psychoanalysis, etc.  47 \n \nadaptation, immune resistance, size, etc.). Moreove r, the latter even seems to have a future \nif one considers general developments in microproce ssors and nanotechnologies. \nNevertheless:  \n \nAgainst this background, it is confusing to claim t hat the body has a history \u2013 in other words \nthat it is historically and culturally relative. Th ereby, indeed, the divide between culture and \nnature, which until recently was perceived as funda mental, dissolves. \u201cThe\u201d human body \nthen ceases to be a timeless standard to, for insta nce, criticise particular societal conditions \nthat leave traces on concrete, perishable bodies. I f these bodies do not only have an \nindividual history but are also subjected \u2013as bodie s\u2013 to historical change, then the nature and \nthe substance of the body as we perceive, represent  and treat them, are no longer a reliable \nreference beyond speech and action. This does not m ean that the body is \u201cnothing other\u201d \nthan a societal construction, or \u201cnothing\u201d but a pu re discourse effect. Bodies die and we do \nalong with them. But the perception, representation  and activities of human beings in \nconcrete historical situations always shape the bod y in a specific way as a social fact: they \n\u201cmould\u201d our nature, into a societal \u201cform\u201d or ascri be a cultural \u201ctext\u201d to it. It is not the \nmetaphors that circumscribe this rapport between na ture and culture which are decisive. \nRather, the crucial point is that the link between nature and culture remains intangible and \ndoes not represent a systematic boundary \u2013distingui shable for all times and cultures\u2013 \nseparating the nature of our bodies from their cult ural coding or shaping. Thus, the body \nquestion becomes a historical one. Without seeking to establish the boundary that has \nseparated the flesh from history during various per iods, one should try to tell the story of this \nrelation. 156     \n \nI have reproduced this rather long quote in full be cause it encapsulates the most \nfundamental issue at stake in the historicisation o f the body: when confronting sources, the \nbody\u2019s nature recedes but does not completely disap pear behind the signs of its cultural, \nhence also technological makeover. Concretely, a 19 80s advertisement for an artificial \nsweetener, \u201cembodied\u201d by a radiant and slender fema le model, will not present us with a \nsense of this individual body\u2019s history \u2013from birth  to decay\u2013 nor, when considered alone, will \nit provide us with clues about the evolution of our  genotype. Rather the body will remain \nsuspended in a web of contemporary signs: it will t ell us something about the slimness and \nfitness ideal of the time, fashionable hairstyles a nd make-up or appropriate representations \nof femininity. When compared with advertisements fo r the same product over a number of \n                                                 \n156  In ibid. pp. 11-12. \u201cAuf diesem Hintergrund ist es irritierend, zu beha upten, der K\u00f6rper habe eine Geschichte \n\u2013 das hei\u00dft: er sei historisch und kulturell relati v. Denn damit f\u00e4llt die in unserer Zivilisation zum indest bis vor \nkurzem noch als grundlegend empfundene Schranke zwi schen Kultur und Natur. \u201eDer\u201c menschliche K\u00f6rper h\u00f6 rt \ndann auf, ein zeitloser Ma\u00dfstab zu sein, ein Ma\u00dfsta b etwa f\u00fcr die Kritik an jenen gesellschaftlichen \nVerh\u00e4ltnissen, die ihre Spuren auf den konkreten, v erg\u00e4nglichen, K\u00f6rpern hinterlassen. Wenn diese K\u00f6rp er nicht \nnur eine individuelle Geschichte haben, sondern auc h als K\u00f6rper \u00fcberhaupt historischem Wandel unterwor fen \nsind, dann sind Natur und Materie des K\u00f6rpers, so w ie wir sie wahrnehmen, vorstellen, repr\u00e4sentieren u nd \nbearbeiten, keine verl\u00e4\u00dfliche Referenz mehr au\u00dferha lb des Sprechens und Handelns. Das hei\u00dft nicht, der  K\u00f6rper \nsei \u201enichts anderes\u201c als eine gesellschaftliche Kon struktion, sei \u201enichts\u201c als ein blo\u00dfer Diskurseffek t.

Ohne die Grenzlinie bestimmen zu wol len, die \nin verschiedenen Zeiten das Fleisch von der Geschic hte schied, mu\u00df man versuchen, die Geschichte diese s \nVerh\u00e4ltnisses zu erz\u00e4hlen.\u201c  48 \n \nyears, it might even uncover clues about the evolvi ng perception of women\u2019s body \nmanagement and status. The anthropologist Kathrin B onacker, in her excellent book on the \ndeciphering of body culture through publicity, prov ides many convincing examples of this \nembedding. 157  She terms the bodies thus \u201cexcavated\u201d from these s ources \u201chyperbodies\u201d  \nbecause they are ideal-types, styled and staged to sell a product and are as devoid of \nambivalence as possible. 158  Indeed, if the advertisement is to be potent, the viewer should \nnot be able to perceive a distance between these hy perbodies and reality: constructedness \nmust either completely recede behind the attainabil ity of this corporeality (if the ad takes a \npositive tack) or its avoidability (if the ad is mo re satirically flavoured). As she points out \nhowever, her publicity-flavoured conceptualisation of hyperbodies differs from that of Jean \nBaudrillard, who sees a hyperbody as a \u201cprojection of the self\u201d in his analysis of the \n\u201cMadonna\u201d phenomenon \u2013thus implying a conscious dis tance between the body and \nidentity that is unthinkable in the advertisements analysed by Bonacker. 159  \n \nFrom a historian\u2019s perspective though, I would argu e that the bodies accessed through my \nsources navigate between these two \u201chyperbody\u201d visi ons \u2013independently of the type of \nvisual source analysed (photographs, advertisements , newspaper or magazine articles, etc.). \nWhether the representations seem to be the result o f a very minimalist staging (maybe even \nexplicitly labelled as \u201cspontaneous\u201d) or whether th ey clearly appear to be the product of a \nsophisticated construction, today\u2019s viewer is left with the very difficult task of determining \nwhat distance there is between the historically emb edded signifier  and its potentially fleshy \nsignified . Just as we cannot convincingly affirm that an adv ertisement (especially when \nconsidered alone) is or is not an emblematic reflec tion of its time, we cannot affirm that a \nprivate photograph condenses the essence of a famil iar \u201clived body\u201d. Indeed, personal \nexperience shows that we often apply a considerable  number of body management \ntechniques before being photographed. In our wester nised cultures at least, we actually \ntend to put on our photographic bodies like a cloak : by tensing belly muscles, smoothing \nunruly hair and wearing a photogenic smile before t he click sounds. Hence, who has never \nfelt uneasy when perusing (even present-day) photog raphs, which seem to alienate our \nperception of self or others?  \n \nThus, all past portrayals of the body remain \u201chyper \u201d, lost between a potentially mimetic \nrealism and a carefully crafted identity projection . They isolate a precisely outlined \u201cmoment \nof the body\u201d in question, without giving us a defin ite clue as to the quality of its aliveness or \ncontinuity, its situatedness in a personal or colle ctive body history. Similarly, \u201cnon-visual\u201d \nsources, such as e.g. statistics on average height,  weight, diet or various epidemiological \nfactors might provide precious indications on gener al \u201cgenotypical\u201d trends over a number of \ndecades but they will leave us in the dark about ho w these changes have been both \ncollectively and/or personally engineered and exper ienced. Thus, an encounter with various \nbody sources will unearth a wealth of signs that co mplement and cross-reference each \n                                                 \n157  Bonacker, Kathrin, op. cit., cf. e.g. pp. 12-14 (N atreen sweetener) or 94-105 (tights for men), etc. \n158  Bonacker, Kathrin, op. cit., p. 8. \n159  Bonacker, Kathrin, op. cit., p. 8 & p. 130.

But an awareness of our personal and cultural/historical \nembodied situatedness, hence its doubly limited per spective, 160  should force us to retain a \ncertain humility, because we know that past \u201clived bodies\u201d forever escape our grasp. 161   \n \nDon Ihde, by distinguishing three dimensions of the  body enables one to recapture a better \nsense of the hierarchy of embodiment in relation to  both \u201clived body\u201d and cultural \nsituatedness  (the \u201clived-body\u201d being the pre-condi tion for the cultural), even though the \nthree dimensions he outlines are rarely experienced  separately. He describes the first one as \nfollows:   \n \nBody one is the existential body of living, here-lo cated bodily experience, the sense of body \nelicited by Husserl as Leib , but much better descriptively developed by Merlea u-Ponty as the \ncorps v\u00e9cu . Body one is the perceiving, active, oriented bein g-a-body from which we \nexperience the world around us. It is the experienc e-as-body that is a constant of all our \nexperiencings. [\u2026] But, and I note this only in pas sing for now, this meaning of body is not \ndirectly or introspectively grasped \u2013 rather it is interactively grasped by way of and in relation \nto the experienced environment or environing world.  Its sense must be reflexively  \nrecovered. 162  \n \nThe emphasis here should be placed on the body as a ctive experiencing subject-medium \n(Ihde emphasises that it is not the Cartesian body- object that is at stake here). \u201cBody one\u201d is \nthe primary condition of interaction but, so to spe ak, only \u201ccomes alive\u201d through its \ninteraction with the world. The implication that th is dimension has for the personal and \ncultural/historical situatedness alluded to in the previous paragraph is that my sense of who \nI am as a historian (and more broadly as a person) is contingent upon the reflections cast \nback onto me by the world \u2014 that is through my acti ve experience of it. Moreover, this \ndimension introduces the crucial concept of the bod y as subject. Without wanting to \nanticipate upon the \u201cEmbodied consciousness\u201d sectio n, Ihde\u2019s \u201cbody one\u201d dimension implies \nthat this level of embodiment is the guarantor of t he uniqueness of my experience (as far as \nI can tell from my position within my own body) and  this even before cultural markers \nintervene. Indeed, nobody can hope to totally share  my embodied perspective and \nconversely I cannot hope to fully explain it to oth ers. Hence, this state of affairs seals the \nfate of the historian even more tightly by a type o f mise en ab\u00eeme : recovering the corps v\u00e9cu  \nexperience of past, \u201cother\u201d bodies appears virtuall y impossible since it proves already very \nchallenging to share my own contemporary bodily exp erience, e.g. in terms of pain or well-\nbeing. As the sociologist Robert Gugutzer contends:  \n                                                 \n160  I can only speak from my body or my experience of embodiment which is anchored in a particular place and \ntime. Concretely, in 2011, I can only speak from th e perspective of a 40-year old, white, female, Brit ish-Swiss \nperson living in Germany, etc. \n161  Cf. Ihde, Don, Bodies in Technology: Electronic Mediations , Volume 5, Minneapolis & London: University of \nMinnesota Press, 2002, p.71. \u201cWhat the body discourses contribute to situated kn owledges is both \ndeconstructive and reconstructive. What is deconstr ucted is the disembodied, nonperspectival, god-tric k \nepistemology of early modernity. What is reconstruc ted is the sense of located, perspectival, embodied , and \nenculturated knowledge that is a praxis and action within and in relation to the surrounding world.\u201d  Cf. also \nibid. p. 69: \u201cPhenomenologically one does not immediately appreh end that one\u2019s vision is perspectival, rather \none\u2019s invariant perspective on the world is reflexi vely realized by noting the ways in which that worl d \u2018points \nback\u2019 to the null point of one\u2019s bodily position. I n this sense, I learn my embodiment by actively bei ng in a \nworld.\u201d   \n162  Ihde, Don, op. cit, p. 69 50 \n \n \nWhen considering the body as an object of research there are a few typical methodological \nproblems, which become especially obvious in empiri cal investigations, but also surface in \ntheoretical essays. It is the \u201cspeechlessness\u201d of t he body that is at stake here. This \nspeechlessness firstly stems from our culture\u2019s lac k of nuanced vocabulary to describe bodily \nphenomena, secondly, from a lack of distance from o ne\u2019s own body and thirdly, from the \nnecessity of translating bodily phenomena into spee ch.  163  \n \nThus, it is both the necessity and the impossibilit y of interpreting \u201cbodyspeak\u201d that renders \nthe body signs we are confronted with so ambivalent  and makes our quest of the \u201cbody \none\u201d dimension so elusive. As Gilles Deleuze put it  [cf. the introductory quote to my study], \nthe contemporary quest to transform the body into a n ontological retreat requires \ntranscending the barriers of our language or signs to let the body re-appropriate discourse.  \n \nIhde then defines \u201cbody two\u201d as the \u201c[\u2026] cultural or socially constructed body [\u2026] upon  \nwhich is written or signified the various possible meanings of politics, culture, the socius.\u201d  It is \nonly at this point then that markers of gender, age , culture and class intervene, markers that \nanchor a particular cultural perspective. But as Ih de stresses it: \u201c[\u2026] for there to be a marked \ncultural body, or body two, there must be a body on e that is markable.\u201d 164  Mary Douglas goes \neven further, since in her analysis of the link bet ween the two body dimensions, she sees a \nmutual influence of the one upon the other: \n \nThe social body constrains the ways the physical bo dy is perceived. The physical experience \nof the body, always modified by the social categori es through which it is known, sustains a \nparticular view of society. There is a continual ex change of meanings between the two kinds \nof bodily experience so that each reinforces the ca tegories of the other. 165  \n \nHowever, the difficulty specifically resides in pin ning down where the point of exchange lies, \nespecially when trying to examine bodies historical ly. Anne Balsamo, in her book \nTechnologies of the Gendered Body , while she does quote Douglas and primarily conduc ts \nher body analysis on a textual basis admits that \u201cTo think of the body as a social construction \nand not as a natural object provokes a deceptively simple question: how is the body, as a \n\u2018thing of nature\u2019, transformed into a \u2018sign of cult ure\u2019?\u201d.  And while she articulates the two \nabove dimensions in terms of \u201cproduct\u201d for the soci al and \u201cprocess\u201d for the lived body, she \ndoesn\u2019t provide her readers with a sense of the mut ually transformative transitions: i.e. how \nthe process leads to the product or how the product  constrains the process. 166  Appropriately, \nthis product/process metaphor then leads us to the \u201cbody three\u201d or technological dimension \n                                                 \n163  Gugutzer, Robert, Soziologie des K\u00f6rpers , Bielefeld: transcript Verlag, 2004, p. 10. \u201cMit dem K\u00f6rper als \nForschungsobjekt ergeben sich einige typische metho dische Probleme, die vor allem in empirischen \nUntersuchungen deutlich werden, jedoch auch in theo retischen Abhandlungen auftreten.

Balsamo, Anne, op. cit., p. 3. \u201cThe works I examine in this book begin with the as sumption that \u2018the body\u2019 \nis a social, cultural, and historical production: \u2018 production\u2019 here means both product and process. As  a product, \nit is the material embodiment of ethnic, racial, an d gender identities, as well as a staged performanc e of \npersonal identity, of beauty, of health (among othe r things). As a process, it is a way of knowing and  marking \nthe world, as well as a way of knowing and marking a \u2018self\u2019.\u201d   51 \n \ndescribed by Don Ihde, a dimension that could help us to define the articulation between \n\u201cbody one\u201d and \u201cbody two\u201d:   \n \nTraversing both body one and body two is a third di mension, the dimension of the \ntechnological. In the past perhaps the most familia r role within which we experienced and \nreexperienced being a body was what I have often ca lled an embodiment relation, that is, the \nrelation of experiencing something in the world thr ough an artefact, a technology. Such \nhuman\u2013technology relations are often simple\u2014seeing through eyeglasses, nailing with \nhammers (Heidegger), negotiating doorways while wea ring long-feathered hats (Merleau-\nPonty). 167   \n \nTechnology, in this vision, can become a sort of co pula mediating between body one and \nbody two: as a product marked by a particular socie ty or culture, technology constrains \nbodily processes (glasses literally frame the gaze of \u201cbody one\u201d just as the hammer requires \na particular \u201cbody one\u201d handling in order to be eff icient). Conversely, technology\u2019s cultural \nmarkings remain lifeless as long as the body is unw illing to literally incorporate it into a corps \nv\u00e9cu  process. Hence, if as historians, we find it diffi cult to restore the link between the two \nfirst dimensions of the body, we can nevertheless t ry to broach it by analysing the \nelaboration, evolution and appropriation of especia lly those technologies that have been \ndesigned to enhance bodies. Echoing Michel Feher, w e can concentrate on how technology \nand techniques have been used to experience, condit ion and express embodiment. The \nhistory of the body is thus  \n \n[\u2026] neither a history of scientific knowledge about  the body nor a history of the ideologies \nthat (mis)represent the body. Rather it is a histor y of \u201cbody building\u201d, of the different modes \nof construction of the human body. The body perceiv ed in this way is not a reality to be \nuncovered in a positivistic description of an organ ism nor is it a transhistorical set of needs \nand desires to be freed from an equally transhistor ical form of repression. This body is \ninstead a reality constantly produced, an effect of  techniques promoting specific gestures \nand postures, sensations and feelings. Only in trac ing these modes of its construction can one \narrive at a thick perception of the present \u201cstate of the body.\u201d 168   \n \nIn this section, I have tried to analyse the body\u2019s  fascinating but slippery trajectory in the \nsocial sciences. It seems that, as historians or so ciologists, we are often condemned to grasp \nelusive signs of the body, knowing full well that t hese potentially deceptive apparitions are \ndragging clunky tin cans of resistant flesh that we  will never be able to access. However, \ntechnology, as it relates to the body, may provide us with a more concrete measure of the \nlatter. The following sub-section is therefore devo ted to exploring how technology, \ntechniques and the experiences they trigger are con ceptualised in this study, by reinstating \nthem as vital markers of embodiment. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n167  Ihde, Don, op. cit., p. xi. \n168  Feher, Michel, \u201eOf Bodies and Technologies\u201d, Discussions in Contemporary Culture , Number One, Ed. Hal \nFoster, DIA Art Foundation, Seattle: Bay Press, 198 7, p. 159. 52 \n \nTechnology  \n \nLe corps est le premier et le plus naturel instrume nt de l\u2019homme. Ou plus exactement, sans \nparler d\u2019instrument, le premier et le plus naturel objet technique, et en m\u00eame temps moyen \ntechnique, de l\u2019homme, c\u2019est son corps. 169  \n \n\u2026technology is more than a set of physical objects or artefacts. It also fundamentally \nembodies a culture or set of social relations made up of certain sorts of knowledge, beliefs, \ndesires, and practices. 170  \n \nAt least half a century, a gender, a nationality an d a disciplinary affiliation separate the two \nquotes I have chosen to introduce my theoretical ex ploration of \u201ctechnology\u201d and its \nnamesakes \u201ctechnique\u201d and \u201cthe technological\u201d. But together, these quotes neatly, if \nperhaps daringly, circumscribe the discussion I am about to stage, since they embrace the \nspectrum leading from technique to technology and f rom the concrete body to abstract \nembodiment.  Marcel Mauss posits the human body as the primeval and most \u201cnatural\u201d \nsource of technology \u2013both object and medium\u2013 thus indirectly pointing to the body as the \nliving paradox that transcends the modernist nature /culture (or technology) divide. Indeed, \nwithout \u201cnatural\u201d body techniques, there is no tech nology. For her part, Judy Wajcman uses \nthe verb \u201cembody\u201d to describe the way technology vi rtually in-corporates  a culture. This \ntension is particularly fruitful from my perspectiv e, since this study concentrates on self-\nconsciously labelled \u201chealthy lifestyle technologie s\u201d (HLTs) that embrace technology, \ntechniques and the technological. These HLTs are de signed to design the body in a way that \nreflects the cultural concerns and expectations of the society they have been developed in \u2013\nnot only in terms of health but also of aesthetics,  comfort, discipline, experience, control, \npleasure, etc. \n \nBecause technology is such a ubiquitous component o f culture-building, in this section I will \nbe proceeding in concentric circles to try to embra ce all the issues that are relevant for my \ncase-study, before narrowing down towards the most concrete arenas. With the help of \nMauss and Wajcman, my first aim is to open up the f ield for a very wide human-centred \nunderstanding of technology. Then, following Herber t Mehrtens\u2019s lead, I will seek to \ndemystify the oppositions that have long plagued th e definition and perception of \ntechnology: society vs. technology, nature vs. tech nology and science vs. technology. By \nfocusing on \u201cthe technological\u201d in hybrid systems, I hope to better grasp what consequences \nthese seeming oppositions have on the technical sty ling of the body and the products and \nprocesses used to achieve this aim. The third step will consist in briefly analysing \nmechanisms of autonomy, control, power but also con tingency in the way HLTs are \nstructured, by drawing on insights from Peter Weing art, Madeleine Akrich, Michel de \nCerteau and Mika Pantzar. After that, I will home i n on the body\u2019s relationship with \ntechnology: from Foucaultian notions of self-discip line to how the modern imagination has \n                                                 \n169  Mauss, Marcel, \u00ab Les technique du corps \u00bb, Journal de Psychologie , XXXII, ne, 3-4, 15 mars-15 avril 1936. \nCommunication pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Psychologie  le 17 mai 1934.

Finally, I will evaluate the implicat ions of these discussions for a historical \naccount of body technologies. \n \nFor Mauss, the human body seals the interdependence  of nature and technology: it is the \n\u201cnatural\u201d catalyst (medium) of technology, but not in the chemical sense, since the body\u2019s \n\u201cnature\u201d is also modified (object) through its inte raction with technology or technique \u2013as \ndisplayed in the relationship between feet and shoe s. 171  In his course notes entitled \u00ab Les \ntechniques du corps \u00bb,  he attempted a transcultural analysis of his obser vations of body \ntechniques in various societies (England, France, t he U.S., Maori New Zealand, Aboriginal \nAustralia, Central Africa, etc.) in order to provid e a satisfactory ethnological definition of \nthese techniques: \u201cI define them as the ways in which man knows how t o use his body \ntraditionally in various societies\u201d .172  Further, he admits having had to overcome the idea  that \na technique invariably involves an instrument by go ing back to a Platonist perspective (i.e. \nmusic and dance as techniques), before refining the  notion of technique as a \u201ctraditional and \neffective act\u201d . Indeed, for him, \u201cif there is no tradition, there is no technique an d no \ntransmission\u201d .173  This implies that body techniques move beyond a re lationship with an \nindividual body to encompass a lineage of bodies. B ut the difference between other \ntraditional acts (such as religious or legal acts) and a traditional technical act resides in the \nfact that the author of the latter consciously purs ues it as \u201ca mechanical, physical or \nphysical-chemical act.\u201d 174  Mauss later broadens the scope of these body techn iques by \nstating that they consist of series of acts that ar e \u201cphysio-psycho-sociological amalgams\u201d .175  \nFor Mauss then, body techniques imply a conscious s teering of physiology (the will or \npsychological intent of the individual moves the bo dy), learning (techniques do not just \nhappen but rely on practice and on a tradition) and  broad cultural influences (a particular \nsociety values or rejects given body techniques). \n \nIt is in both its traditional and psycho-sociologic al aspects that Mauss\u2019s vision of \u201cbody \ntechniques\u201d links up with the \u201cbeyond-the-hardware\u201d  vision of technology promoted by \nWacjman and other sociologists of her generation, s ince they see technology as \u201ca cultural \nproduct which is historically constituted by certai n sorts of knowledge and social practices as \nwell as other forms of representation.\u201d 176  Pierre Rabardel, a French professor of psychology \nand ergonomics, balks at the current ethymological erosion of \u201ctechnology\u201d or \u201ctechnical\u201d \nthat often ignores the original Greek meaning [i.e \u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b5: art or craft, hence man-made] as \n                                                 \n171  Mauss compares the example of the \u201conioi\u201d gait (te chnique) cultivated by Maori women and the effect o f \nshoes (technology): \u201cC\u2019\u00e9tait une fa\u00e7on acquise, et non pas une fa\u00e7on na turelle de marcher. En somme, il n\u2019existe \npeut-\u00eatre pas de \u201cfa\u00e7on naturelle\u201d chez l\u2019adulte. A  plus forte raison lorsque d\u2019autres faits technique s \ninterviennent: pour ce qui est de nous, le fait que  nous marchons avec des souliers transforme la posi tion de nos \npieds; quand nous marchons sans souliers, nous le s entons bien.\u201d , Mauss, Marcel, op. cit., p. 9. \n172  Mauss, Marcel, ibid., p. 5 : \u00ab J\u2019entends par ce mot les fa\u00e7ons dont les hommes, soci\u00e9t\u00e9 par soci\u00e9t\u00e9, d\u2019une \nfa\u00e7on traditionnelle, savent se servir de leur corp s. \u00bb \n173  Mauss, Marcel, ibid., p. 10 : \u00ab un acte traditionnel efficace \u00bb  ;  \u00ab Il n\u2019y a pas de technique et pas de \ntransmission, s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de tradition. \u00bb  \n174  Mauss, Marcel, ibid., p. 10 : \u00ab [\u2026] celui-ci est senti par l\u2019auteur comme un acte  d\u2019ordre m\u00e9canique, physique \nou physico-chimique et qu\u2019il est poursuivi dans ce but. \u00bb  \n175  Mauss, Marcel, ibid., p. 23 : cf. \u00ab [\u2026] nous nous trouvons partout en pr\u00e9sence de mon tages physio-psycho-\nsociologiques de s\u00e9ries d\u2019actes. \u00bb  \n176  Wacjman, op. cit., p. 158. 54 \n \nrevived and even expanded by Heidegger. 177  He thus suggests a form of tautological coinage \nto re-emphasise the human element: \n  \nTechnical objects and systems are incorrectly terme d. It would be better to speak of \nanthropotechnical objects or systems, despite the i nelegance of the term. [\u2026] Man is \nomnipresent in their life cycles from their concept ion to their discarding, through the \nessential phases of their functioning and use. 178  \n \nKlaus Tuchel, a German philosopher is even more rad ical in his anthropocentric thrust \nbecause he sees man  \n \n[\u2026] not as a nice ingredient, which could just as w ell be omitted, but as a universal and \nessential trait of anything technical. The narrow d efinition of technology as calculable means \nis incomplete and presents a false perspective on w hat technology actually is. To talk about \ntechnology without human beings is senseless. 179  \n \nIn contrast with apparently more disembodied techno logies such as steel armatures or \nconcrete blocks, Rabardel and Tuchel\u2019s concern abou t the humanness of technology is \nparticularly central when discussing HLTs, since ma n is not only present and active \nthroughout the life-cycle of an HLT (as producer, m ediator, consumer, etc.) but is also its \ncentral object. Like other more traditional body-ce ntred technologies such as shoes or \nhairbrushes, HLTs are actually designed to accompan y and act upon human beings \nthroughout their life-cycles: there are functional foods, movement techniques, cosmetics, \nand alternative health practices for all ages (thin k e.g. of baby \u201cmovement\u201d classes, ballet or \nfootball for teenagers, yoga or weight-lifting for the middle-aged and senior gymnastics\u2026). \nMoreover, instead of stopping at the periphery of t he body or just moulding/designing it \nfrom the outside, they are often ingested, absorbed , breathed in, transformed into reflexes, \nroutines etc. In other words they become embodied  and so inseparable from consumers\u2019 \nbodily consciousness as to become constitutive of t heir identities. It is therefore not only \nsenseless to distinguish individuals from the HLTs they consume, but almost impossible. This \nbackground also further undermines the definition s tub that Tuchel has been attacking \u2013to \nwit, the claim that technology is calculable. Indee d, since they are designed to appeal to a \nbody considered as a highly subjective and holistic  entity, the effects of HLTs remain \nconsciously unpredictable. However, this is a quest ion I will try to address more precisely in \nthe \u201cEmbodied consciousness\u201d section. \n \nBut how should we describe technology then? Is it c ondemned to remain a fuzzy concept, \nthe contours of which are impossible to draw? Until  now, we have seen that it involves \nhuman beings and their techniques, that it has both  material and immaterial components, \n                                                 \n177  Cf. \u201cDie Frage nach der Technik\u201d [1953], in: Heide gger, Martin, Vortr\u00e4ge und Aufs\u00e4tze , Stuttgart: Klett-Cola, \n2004. \n178  Rabardel, Pierre, Les Hommes et les technologies : Approche cognitive  des instruments contemporains , Paris: \nArmand Colin, 1995, p. 9 : \u00ab Les objets et les syst\u00e8mes techniques sont improp rement nomm\u00e9s.

Von Technik zu sprechen, oh ne zugleich vom Menschen zu sprechen, ist sinnlos.\u201c   55 \n \nnot to mention embodied aspects. Moreover, it impli es some form of continuity or \ntransmission (traditional/historical or cultural as pects). Thus, rather than abiding with too \nnarrow a definition, I am tempted to agree with Waj cman\u2019s recapitulative distinction into \nthree layers of meaning:  \n \nFirstly, \u2018technology\u2019 is a form of knowledge, as St audenmaier emphasizes. Technological \n\u2018things\u2019 are meaningless without the \u2018know-how\u2019 to use them, repair them, design them and \nmake them. That know-how often cannot be captured i n words. It is visual, even tactile, \nrather than simply verbal or  mathematical. But it can also be systematized and t aught, as in \nthe various disciplines of engineering. Few authors  however would be content with this \ndefinition of technology as a form of knowledge. \u2018T echnology\u2019 also refers to what people do \nas well as what they know. An object such as a car or a vacuum cleaner is a technology, \nrather than an arbitrary lump of matter, because it  forms part of a set of human activities. A \ncomputer without programs and programmers is simply  a useless collection of bits of metal, \nplastic and silicon. \u2018Steelmaking\u2019, say, is a techn ology: but this implies that the technology \nincludes what steelworkers do, as well as the furna ces they use. So \u2018technology\u2019 refers to \nhuman activities and practices. And finally, at the  most basic level, there is the \u2018hard-ware\u2019 \ndefinition of technology, in which it refers to set s of physical objects, for example, cars, \nlathes, vacuum cleaners and computers. 180  \n \nHence culturally contingent knowledge, practice and  hardware are at stake in technology. \nBut if it doesn\u2019t seem to be separable from human i deas, activities, products and even \nbodies (as in the case of HLTs), can it be contrast ed with anything else to help us distinguish \nits contours? Herbert Mehrtens argues that such maj or counter-poles as nature, science and \nsociety are no longer tenable from our current hist orical perspective: \n \nOppositions such as \u2018nature and technology\u2019, \u2018scien ce and technology\u2019, \u2018society and \ntechnology\u2019 have long lost their significance as se parative and thus clarifying categorisations \nbecause the aim of historical activity is to uncove r the connections, the interactions and \nintertwinements with which the past reaches into ou r present and future. 181    \n \nHowever, it should be noted that these polarisation s have made sense and even proved \nfruitful at given times even if Mauss and Wajcman h ave made it amply clear that it is futile to \npursue an elusive distinction between society and t echnology and Mauss has also blurred \nthe distinction between nature and technology (cult ure) through his definition of the body. \nIndeed, even though a number of late modern or reso lutely non-modern thinkers such as \nBruno Latour, have denounced the nature/culture div ide as a delusive and damaging \nconstruction, 182  this modernist opposition has proved particularly resilient and its \nramifications can still be felt today:  \n                                                 \n180  Wacjman, ibid., pp. 14-15. \n181  Mehrtens, Herbert, \u201eGilt das Trennungsaxiom?

On the basis of contemporary hybrid phenomena  such as polluted rivers, frozen embryos, the hole in the \nozone layer or the AIDS virus, Bruno Latour  patiently deconstructs modernity\u2019s painstaking but illusory efforts \nto separate nature from culture as well as subject from objects. 56 \n \n   \nAt the moment it appears that the word nature is pe rforming three functions; it is seen: as a \nnormative horizon fixing universalist ethical limit s to technical activity (\u201cthat\u2019s against nature, \nit\u2019s unnatural\u201d), as an horizon of technical exploi tation and as ecos, as ecology, which \nsometimes links up with the desire to create some o ther kind of nature. 183  \n \nIt is probably because technology is perceived as t hreateningly pervasive that society clings \nto a mythological dimension of nature even if it ha s become a signifier almost depleted of \nany tangible signifieds. Indeed, just like \u201couter n ature\u201d, contemporary \u201cnatural\u201d bodies have \nbecome inseparable from technological intrusions. 184  Mirroring the consciously active \nlandscaping processes that involve felling trees, s praying pesticides or introducing exotic \nspecies of plants and animals (as well as the less conscious ones involving various types of \npollution and poisoning), bodies are also constantl y knowingly and mindlessly designed and \nre-designed by everyday technologies \u2013be it through  cycling to work in an urban setting, \nsitting all day in office chairs or using toothbrus hes and antiperspirants. With the rise of \ngenetic engineering, fertility enhancing technologi es and increasingly invasive antenatal care \n(not to mention the impact of the above-mentioned e nvironmental conditions on fertility \nand gestation), even the \u201cnaturalness\u201d of the newbo rn or unborn child is exposed as a \nfiction. 185  As Latour puts it:  \n \n\u2026the body itself, can also be perceived technologic ally [\u2026]. Every artist, technician or \ncraftsman knows full well that technicality is but a new form of distribution between bodies \u2013\nsome natural, others artificial\u2013 and that it is onl y vascularisation that enables these feats \nwhich, due to laziness, are subsequently attributed  to human genius. In that sense, according \nto the expression coined by Marcel Mauss, all techn iques are body techniques. 186   \n \nNevertheless, despite this recognition, we find it almost impossible to let go of our quasi-\nFrankensteinian division of nature and culture/tech nology. Indeed, it has truly overtaken us, \nsince it seems to have alienated us from both poles  by trapping us in a vise between their \nexcesses. To wit, the use of technology is often mo tivated by the wish to correct the \u201cflaws\u201d \nof nature, a nature at once so present, powerful an d potentially threatening that we feel the \nneed to control it through technology\u2026 until technol ogy is perceived as perhaps even more \n                                                 \n183  Jardine, Alice, \u201eOf Bodies and Technologies, in: Discussions in Contemporary Culture , Number One, op. cit., \np. 157. \n184  Indeed, in the course of his analysis of the conce pt of naturalness, Dieter Birnbacher reminds us tha t: \u201eUnter \nden Dingen, mit denen wir in unserer Lebenszeit in direkten Kontakt kommen, ist das in Reinform K\u00fcnstl iche \nebenso rar wie das in Reinform Nat\u00fcrliche.

Or to use \nanother landscaping metaphor, bodies\u2019 naturalness i s reinvented as in English-style gardens \nwhere feigned artlessness is in fact extremely cont rolled. Braces, orthopaedic shoes and \nspeech therapy are but a few of the technologies or  techniques belonging to the arsenal that \nseeks to recreate or perfect nature in the body. An d I would argue that HLTs even go a step \nfurther since both in their production and in the m arketing rhetoric that packages them, this \nuneasy alliance is not only repeatedly featured but , to some extent, even normalised or \ncelebrated \u2013 based on the recognition that there is  no going back to a primeval nature \ndevoid of the technology we have become so dependen t upon. For instance, a review article \non the 1980s published in a German women\u2019s magazine  in 1989 discusses, among other \ndevelopments, those in the cosmetics realm. The mai n gist of the debate revolves around \nnatural cosmetics: whether on the one hand, they ca n be considered as hygienically and \nclinically secure and on the other, if they can sti ll be perceived as \u201cnatural\u201d after the \nChernobyl catastrophe \u2013thus illustrating the ambiva lence surrounding the attributes of both \nnature and technology. To find a way out of the imp asse, the author then concludes that the \nnew motto for cosmetics should be \u201cAs much nature as possible but with industrial pur ity \nstandards\u201d .187   \nJust as it is difficult to separate nature from tec hnology in HLTs, it has become futile to try \nand strictly distinguish between science and techno logy in these products. Indeed, when \nviewed from a healthy lifestyle perspective, the de bate on the characteristics of science \nversus those of technology, as e.g. framed by John Staudenmaier for the \u201cTechnology and \nCulture\u201d  journal in the mid-1980s, now appears rather quain t. The only point that still seems \nrelevant to me in the case of HLTs is the reference  to aesthetics, linked to the discussion of \nT&C  author Cyril Smith. The latter contends that in ma n\u2019s early history there was no \ndistinction between aesthetic, scientific and techn ological categories: indeed, in the process \nof moulding a statue, an artist could understand th e properties of matter and use them to \nachieve his purpose. 188  As we will see in the course of this study, a heal thy lifestyle implies \nthe creation of an individualised if commodified ae sthetics of everyday life \u2013 which is why \nproducers\u2019 focus is on contributing to this aesthet ics by designing goods that can be \ncreatively appropriated by consumers. In the proces s, the latter may become aware of \nscientific or technological issues, but the point i s nevertheless that both science and \ntechnology are subservient to the aesthetic purpose . It is therefore irrelevant for a company \nto clearly define and hierarchize the inputs provid ed by these two domains. Instead, \n\u201cscience\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d are usually just name-dr opped, often indiscriminately, as \nreassuring but increasingly dispensable pedigrees o f soundness and rationality. 189   \n                                                 \n187  \u201eDas waren die 80er Jahre\u201c, Freundin , 25, 1989, pp. 102-108, p. 105: \u201eSoviel Natur wie m\u00f6glich aber \nindustrielle Reinheitsstandards\u201c.  \n188  Staudenmaier, John, Technology's storytellers: reweaving the human fabr ic , Cambridge MA: MIT Press, \n1985, p. 100. \n189  This becomes particularly obvious in Chapter 6 ( Cosmetics Case-Study ). However, in other domains, the \ndistinction between science and technology remains valid and fruitful. For a good overview of the deba te on \nthis distinction \u2013especially as it relates to the e pistemological constitution and legitimacy of histo ry of \ntechnology or technology studies\u2013 and its implicati ons in industrial innovation, cf. e.g. Faulkner, We ndy, 58 \n \nDe facto, in most health and beauty companies, deve lopment teams are transdisciplinary -\ninvolving chemists, biologists, biotechnologists, m aterials engineers, pharmacists, medical \ndoctors, lab technicians, beauticians, make-up arti sts, marketing specialists, etc. And the \nR&D process itself, for products such as cosmetics and food, constantly swings back and \nforth between physiological (i.e. scientific) findi ngs on the body \u2013enabled by new \ntechnologies\u2013 and the elaboration of new technologi es that have a direct impact on \nphysiology, hence on further scientific observation  and description. Therefore, echoing \nRabardel\u2019s concern over the inclusion of \u201cman\u201d in t he \u201ctechnical\u201d leading to the coinage of \n\u201canthropotechnical\u201d objects and systems, one can on ly champion the use of \n\u201ctechnoscientific\u201d 190  to qualify the endeavours of research in the body enhancement field. If \nthe expertise of physicians, chemists or pharmacist s 191  still prominently features in the \nGerman pharmaceutical, nutritional and cosmetic lan dscapes, 192  engineering or \u201capplied\u201d \nscientific knowledge is just as frequently acknowle dged and sought after, as illustrated by \nthe success of certification labels provided by a n umber of independent testing agencies \nsuch as \u201cT\u00dcV\u201d 193 , \u201cStiftung Warentest\u201d 194  or \u201c\u00d6kotest\u201d 195 .   \nThus, especially in the case of HLTs, instead of de fining technology in opposition to society, \nnature or science, I find it more helpful to adopt Herbert Mehrtens\u2019s suggestion not to focus \non \u201ctechnology\u201d  but on \u201cthe technological\u201d , a dimension which must be located and \nanalysed in complex historical phenomena. He sugges ts that \u201cthe technological\u201d  be defined \n                                                                                                                                                         \n\u201cConceptualizing Knowledge Used in Innovation: A Se cond Look at the Science-Technology Distinction and  \nIndustrial Innovation\u201d, Science, Technology, & Human Values , 19, 1994, 425-458: \u201cThis review led to the \nconsclusion that there is a strongly interactive re lationship between science and technology, instrume ntalities \nbeing an important area of overlap. In some new fie lds, such as biotechnology, the relationship betwee n them is \nso intimate that the boundaries between them appear  blurred, if not obliterated. Nonetheless, technolo gy can \nbe distinguished from science because of its practi cal, artifactual orientation. This has implications  for both its \nsociotechnical organization and its cognitive or ep istemological character.\u201d  (p. 451)  \n190  Thus echoing Bruno Latour again, cf.

Indeed, both in temporal and spatial t erms, the definition applies only \nfleetingly, since correlations and interactions are  not controllable: \n \nThe technological is historically powerful, but thi s power has no ruler and no controller. The \nword \u201ctechnology\u201d \u2013used without an article\u2013197  suggests a unified power, which could be \nharnessed by \u201cman\u201d. This is one of the most success ful western modernist narratives, but a \nnarrative that has fundamentally lost its credibili ty. The technological is not a sum of \nphenomena that can be isolated; it is found in thin gs, events, living beings, pictures and \nsigns, fantasies and hopes \u2013 it is scattered, heter ogeneous and heterologous, but entangled \nin dense and multifarious interrelations. 198  \n \nHowever, even if I essentially agree with Mehrtens that technology can no longer be viewed \ndeterministically as an abstract \u201cdeus ex or in mac hina\u201d 199  and that the power of the \ntechnological must always be locally circumscribed,  I find that in the case of HLTs the notion \nof power must be refined because it is particularly  difficult to locate. Peter Weingart \ndistinguishes between two contexts of use for techn ology, contexts that have very different \nimplications in terms of power: the professional re alm where the use of specific (often \nexpensive) technologies seems to dictate a particul ar type of specialised human behaviour \nand the everyday or private realm where technology is appropriated individually. In the \nlatter it also means that:  \n \n                                                 \n196  Mehrtens, Herbert, op. cit., p. 238. \u201eDamit w\u00e4re eine Definition nicht\u201ader Technik sonde rn des Technischen \nf\u00e4llig, das in den historischen Erscheinungen zu lo kalisieren und zu analysieren ist.

Marx, Leo, \u201cTechnology: The Emergence of a Haza rdous Concept\u201d, Technology and Culture , Volume 51, \nNumber 3, July 2010, pp. 561-577. There are at leas t four noteworthy points in Marx\u2019s argumentation: \u201c belated \nemergence\u201d (historically speaking, the term is rela tively new in the English language), \u201csemantic void \u201d \n(technology describes complex technical phenomena t hat prior or competing expressions fail to adequate ly \ndesignate), \u201cconceptual competition\u201d (obviously, th ere were other contenders for this role but they we re \ndismissed over time) and \u2013the most interesting poin t for us in the context of this study\u2013 \u201chazardous a gency\u201d (a \nquasi-mystical agency has been devolved to technolo gy). To quote Marx: \u201cBy now, however, the concept has \nbeen endowed with a thing-like autonomy and a seemi ngly magical power of historical agency. We have ma de \nit an all-purpose agent of change. As compared with  other means of reaching our social goals, the tech nological \nhas come to seem the most feasible, practical, and economically viable. It relieves the citizenry of o nerous \ndecision-making obligations and intensifies their g athering sense of political impotence. The popular belief in \ntechnology as a\u2014if not the\u2014primary force shaping th e future is matched by our increasing reliance on \ninstrumental standards of judgment, and a correspon ding neglect of moral and political standards, in m aking \njudgments about the direction of society.\u201d  (p. 577). 60 \n \n[...] it is massively disseminated and is subordina ted to subjective needs of and capacities for \ncontrol. This type of everyday life technology is b y definition Every(wo)man\u2019s technology. \nThis does not mean that it does not require adjustm ents in order to be used. But these must \nbe kept in check, if individual use and control are  to be ensured.  200   \n \nHowever, the appropriation of HLTs, perhaps more th an that of other everyday technologies, \nentails a clearer power struggle between producers\u2019  and mediators\u2019 normative health and \nbeauty values on the one hand and those of consumer s which may be more individually-\ntailored, hence also resistant or subversive. Madel eine Akrich, as a sociologist rooted in the \nActor-Network-Theory (ANT), postulates that conditi ons of usage \u2013which usually correspond \nto certain user representations 201 \u2013 are objectified in technologies as so-called \u201cscr ipts\u201d. She \nthus interprets technologies as non-human actors wh ich prescribe the behaviour of their \n(human) users and thus argues against the dividing of the social and the technical as \npromoted by the SCOT (social construction of techno logy) theory. 202  Producers (often in \ncollaboration with mediators) inscribe their vision s and predictions of the world in the \ntechnologies they design. The \u201cscript\u201d metaphor ref ers to a film script because both define a \nframework for future actions. For Akrich, \u201ca technical artifact can be described as a scenari o \nreplete with a stage, roles, and directions governi ng the interactions between the (human \nand nonhuman) actors who are supposed to assume tho se roles\u201d .203  Many design choices can \nthus be seen as \u201cdecisions about what should be delegated to the te chnology and what \nshould be left to the initiative of human actors\u201d .204   \n \nThis vision of technology could leave one with the impression that if the human element is a \nco-determinant of technology, power inequalities de termined by the varying resources of \ndifferent human groups (in this case those of produ cers vs. those of consumers) can endow \ntechnology with a form of proxy authority, leaving users quite disempowered. As put by \nUlrich and Elisabeth Beck-Gernsheim, \u201c[technology] appears as both the product and the \ninstrument of social needs, interests and conflicts . Technology is effect and cause at the same \ntime.\u201d 205  But even Madeleine Akrich, in her examples drawn f rom technology transfers \n                                                 \n200  Weingart, Peter, \u201eDifferenzierung der Technik oder  Entdifferenzierung der Kultur\u201c, in Technik im Alltag , Ed. \nBernward Joerges, Frankfurt a/Main: Suhrkamp, 1988,  pp. 148-149. \u201eDas bedeutet auch, da\u00df sie massenhaft \nverbreitet ist und subjektiven Kontrollbed\u00fcrfnissen  und \u2013f\u00e4higkeiten unterliegt.

In that sense, Akrich agre es with Michel de Certeau and his concept \nof subversive use that presents a more nuanced view  of agency. 206  Subversive use is \nunderpinned by users\u2019 ability to tinker (in French:  \u201cbricoler\u201d) within the praxis of \nconsumption, even when the room to manoeuvre is ext remely limited. This particular \nresource of consumers can be termed the \u201ctactics of consumption, the ingenious ways in \nwhich the weak make use of the strong, [which] thus  lend a political dimension to everyday \npractices.\u201d 207  The consumer, as a creative and cunning individual , but without the benefit of \na proper (a spatial or institutional location) 208  resorts to spur-of-the-moment tactics in \nher/his arts of using [in French: \u201carts de faire\u201d] to counter the long-term strategies of \nproducers who are anchored in a recognized, defensi ble locus. 209   \n \nWhat this implies for users of HLTs is that they ca n collaborate, vie with, resist or even \nsubvert the authority vested in non-human artefacts  and processes, under the guise of \nbiological additives, computer steered fitness prog rammes, cosmic energy flows, or more \nconcrete design options or instructions for use (wh ich are also upheld by institutionalised \nmediators such a governmental agencies, physicians or wellness experts). In this context, I \nam reminded of a former flatmate whose diet consist ed exclusively of the cheapest and \nfattiest fast food available on the German market, excluding all fresh fruit and vegetables. \nNevertheless, he would guzzle litre upon litre of a  so-called A-C-E fruit drink, assuring me \nthat it was a very positive contribution to his hea lth\u2026 heedless of potential vitamin surfeit or \nthe \u201cone-leggedness\u201d of his health strategies. Far removed from the healthy lifestyle ethos \n(involving a balanced diet, sport, etc.) in which t his type of product is supposedly embedded \nor a more straightforward physiological \u201ccommon sen se\u201d implying a carefully monitored \nintake of nutrients, my flatmate seemed to simply c onsider the drink as a convenient \ntechnical-mental fix to solve his daily \u201cwhat-should-I-do-for-my-health?\u201d  conundrum. 210   \n \nAt any rate, the appropriation or domestication of a technology presupposes at least a \nminimal margin of interpretive flexibility, as a pr econdition for its adoption into a particular \nsetting. Which is why I would be tempted to agree w ith Mika Pantzar who argues for the \ncoexistence of configuring (by engineers, designers  or more generally producers) and \nappropriating (by users) because he sees scripts as  allowing for different scales of \ninterpretative flexibility. First, there are script s for \u201ccorrect consumption\u201d as suggested by \nadvertisers or public discourse \u2013which, in contrast  with Akrich\u2019s scripts are not inscribed in a \ntechnology but ascribed.

Concision \nconstraints mean that I cannot delve too deeply int o a concept he develops over several \nstudies, which is why I will concentrate on the not es for the Technologies of the Self  \nseminar. 212  Broadly, he defines technologies as \u201cspecific techniques that human beings use \nto understand themselves\u201d , before specifying:  \n   \nAs a context, we must understand that there are fou r major types of these \u201ctechnologies,\u201d \neach a matrix of practical reason: (1) technologies  of production, which permit us to produce, \ntransform, or manipulate things; (2) technologies o f sign systems, which permit us to use \nsigns, meanings, symbols, or signification; (3) tec hnologies of power, which determine the \nconduct of individuals and submit them to certain e nds or domination, an objectivizing of the \nsubject; (4) technologies of the self, which permit  individuals to effect by their own means or \nwith the help of others a certain number of operati ons on their own bodies and souls, \nthoughts, conduct, and way of being, so as to trans form themselves in order to attain a \ncertain state of happiness, purity, wisdom, perfect ion, or immortality. 213   \nFoucault thus provides yet another slant on our que st for a good definition of technology, a \nperspective that may prove as confusing for a tradi tional historian of technology as it may \nprove enlightening for a historian of health and th e body. The first point that should be \nmentioned is that the Foucaultian acception of both  \u201ctechniques\u201d and \u201ctechnologies\u201d is \nmuch wider than that of the authors I have quoted u ntil now. Indeed, he labels as \ntechnologies  a symbolic realm, as well as an outer and inner go vernmentality that, at first \nsight, seem detached from the technological hardwar e of production. However, as he goes \non to add: \u201c These four types of technologies hardly ever functi on separately, although each \none of them is associated with a certain type of do mination.\u201d 214  He then narrows down his \nfocus specifically on the fourth category because h e is \u201cmore and more interested in the \n                                                 \n211  The reference to Mika Pantzar is freely adapted fr om Bingle, Gwen & Weber, Heike, op. cit., pp. 29-30 .

In the first case, he \nrevives the classical notion of \u201c epimelesthai sautou\u201d (take care of yourself) as opposed to the \nmore popular  \u201cgnothi sauton\u201d (know yourself) , explaining how these two dimensions were \narticulated in the Greco-Roman as opposed to the mo dern world: \u201c To summarize: There has \nbeen an inversion between the hierarchy of the two principles of antiquity, \u2018Take care of \nyourself\u2019 and \u2018Know thyself\u2019. In Greco-Roman cultur e knowledge of oneself appeared as the \nconsequence of taking care of yourself. In the mode rn world, knowledge of oneself \nconstitutes the fundamental principle.\u201d 216  Foucault sees the reason for this inversion in the  \nfact that the rigorous moral order and austerity pr inciples of modern Western society could \nnot accommodate care of the self as a premise, sinc e renunciation of the self was seen as \nthe utmost goal. Moreover, morality was viewed as a n external product based on the \nrelation with others rather than with the self. 217  Philipp Sarasin, however, reminds his \nreaders that Foucault\u2019s interpretation of the Ancie nt Greek \u201cdietetics\u201d as an \u201cart of living\u201d \nembedded in an \u201caesthetics of existence\u201d has been d eemed misguided by classics scholars \nand historians of Classical Antiquity. Indeed, comp ared to the Greek understanding, \nFoucault\u2019s \u201csouci de soi\u201d (or \u201ctechnologies of the self\u201d) does not seem to really overlap with \nthe classical model: \u201cIf one can credit these assessments, the ancient \u201c dietetics\u201d and the care \nfor the self were much more medically and spiritual ly oriented than Foucault\u2019s very secular \nand aestheticizing representation of Classical Anti quity\u2019s technologies of the self.\u201d 218   \nBut what can be retained from this debate for my di scussion of HLTs is the fact that in the \nlate modern period, disenchantment with many of mod ernity\u2019s postulates has led to a \ncertain alienation from the gnothi sauton . Just as the unintended material side-effects of \ntechnology have undermined blind faith in \u201crational \u201d technical fixes, their mental side-\neffects (in terms of uncertainty, risk, fear, isola tion, etc.) have led to an estrangement from a \nunified, Cartesian self, towards a diffracted ident ity that seems increasingly unknowable. In \nthis context, the epimelesthai sautou  can be perceived as a refuge, an investment in \nsomething perceived as comfortably accessible and s ubjective: the body and its well-being. \nBut this shift does not mean that the quest for the  gnothi sauton  has disappeared, rather it is \nmediated through the pursuit of epimelesthai sautou . Whether this is a turn back to classical \nvalues or to a Foucaultian model is hardly relevant  here, since the ethic underlying HLTs \nseeks to happily (and relatively unreflexively) emb race all dimensions of everyday life, \nwhether medical, spiritual, secular or aesthetic. T hus, HLTs freely draw on, flexibly \nrecombine 219  and promote a \u201cnumber of operations\u201d  on consumers\u2019 \u201cown bodies and souls, \n                                                 \n215  Ibid., p. 19. \n216  Ibid., p. 22. \n217  Ibid., p. 22. \n218  Sarasin, Philipp, op.cit p. 458: \u201cDie antike Di\u00e4tetik und die Sorge um sich waren al so, wenn man diesen \nUrteilen glauben schenken darf, zugleich medizinisc her wie auch spiritueller als Foucaults sehr diesse itige und \n\u00e4sthetisierende Darstellung der antiken Selbsttechn ik.\u201d  Sarasin therefore sees a much closer affiliation b etween \nFoucault and hygienic thought: \u201c...Foucault\u2019s Modell des souci de soi als Form, di e Freiheit des Subjekts zu \ndenken, ist eine Erbe der Hygieniker. Foucault ist damit in doppelter Weise auf die Geschichte bezogen , die ich \nrekonstruiere: als theoretischer und historiographi scher Ausgangspunkt f\u00fcr Fragen, die sich ohne seine  B\u00fccher \nnicht h\u00e4tten stellen lassen \u2013 und als gro\u00dfer Hygien iker.\u201c  From Sarasin, Philipp, ibid., p. 28.  \n219  Cf. my discussion of \u201crecombinance\u201d as a master me taphor in the next section on \u201cCommodification\u201d. 64 \n \nthoughts, conduct, and way of being, the transforma tive aim being to attain a certain state \nof happiness, purity, wisdom, perfection, or immort ality\u201d 220 . They combine \u201csouci de soi\u201d and \n\u201cdietetics\u201d techniques, be it under the guise of si mplistic auto-suggestion and dialogue \ntechniques, 221  special nutritional regimens, exercise routines, o rganisation and relaxation \ntips or meditation practices. Contemporary popular discourse on wellness clearly reflects \nthis wide purport, as in this example drawn from th e website of \u201cArs Vitalis\u201d \u2013a gym that \nopened in 1994 in Berlin\u2013 where wellness is qualifi ed as a \u201cholistic lifestyle therapy and \nprophylaxis\u201d :   \n \nAs a life philosophy, wellness influences well-bein g and can thus be defined as physical \nactivity in connection with spiritual relaxation an d mental stimulation. [\u2026] The approach is \nholistic and embraces both personal attitudes towar ds life and the specific situations of \nindividuals. The aim is to improve bodily performan ce, mental agility and spiritual resilience, \nnot to mention a harmonious private life as well as  a positive attitude towards work in \nharmony with nature. 222  \n \nHere, the aesthetics of HLTs subjects the moral ord er of the polis 223  to an ethic of \n\u201cindividualistic\u201d health commodification, 224  an issue that was not explicitly tackled by \nFoucault. Compared to Foucaultian or classical tech nologies of the self, the commodification \nof health and well-being implied by HLTs is thus me diated by the purchase and appropriation \nof concrete, mechanical technologies such as specif ic dietary supplements, cosmetics, fitness \nappliances, etc. and more immaterial processes, ser vices or experiences (e.g. a voucher for a \nwellness \u201coasis\u201d experience including sauna, massag e, facial, soft music, light therapy, etc.). \nAlice Jardine therefore argues for a superimpositio n of a mechanistic and a Foucaultian \nunderstanding of technology:   \n                                                 \n220  Cf.

Its bas ic premise is that to achieve any kind of success o ne must create \nrich imagery of the goal, and must imitate (model) and internalize the appropriate behavioral patterns . Its \nname is derived from how senses filter and process experience before storing it in brain (neuro), how one uses \nwords and symbols to create mental pictures (lingui stic), and how desired habits and attitudes become \ningrained (programming). Proposed in 1970s in the U S jointly by John Grinder (born 1940, a professor o f \nlinguistics) and John Bandler (born 1950, a mathema tician) in association with the UK anthropologist a nd social \nscientist Gregory Bateson (1904-80), its claims are  yet to be proven by scientific studies.\u201d  \n(http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/neuro- linguistic-programming-NLP.html ) [Websites accessed \nAug. 2011].  \n222  http://www.ars-vitalis.de/wellness/ : \u201cAls Lebensphilosophie pr\u00e4gt Wellness das Wohlbefin den und kann \ndaher als k\u00f6rperliche Aktivit\u00e4t in Verbindung mit s eelischer Entspannung und geistiger Anregung defini ert \nwerden.

Various histories and genealogies of technology (from the Greek word techn\u0113 \nthrough Heidegger\u2019s \u201cQuestion of Technology\u201d to con temporary \u201chigh techniques\u201d) have \nbrought us to the point where what Foucault describ ed \u201cmetaphorically\u201d as techniques of \ntechno-bio-power have merged with our everyday sens e of the term of technology as \n\u201cmechanical\u201d (from the Greek mechanos )\u2014although a lot of people insist Foucault wasn\u2019t \nbeing metaphorical. This has produced a series of m egamachines which are disciplining and \npunishing the body\u2014by which I do not mean some abst ract entity but the flesh \u2014in new and \nsometimes overwhelming ways. 225  \n \nBut the perverse twist in this reading is the quest ion of agency and its delegation as it \npertains to HLTs. Just as other technologies, HLTs represent nodes or intersections of power: \nfirst there is the power delegated by producers to the design of the product or process \n(which seems to confer technology with an impetus o f its own) as we discussed it with \nAkrich\u2019s script  concept. Second, I would name the power of a speci fic cultural \nenvironment/or landscape 226  that seeks to frame or dictate the \u201ccorrect use\u201d o f the product \n(to go back to our discussion of interpretative fle xibility) and which emanates either from \nproduction or mediation institutions \u2013in the guise of instructions for use, magazines, \nwebsites, governmental guidelines, etc. Third, ther e is the power of the user that can be \nenlisted (or not) to conform to, negotiate with, re sist or subvert a technology. Thus, in the \ncontext of contemporary HLTs, the megamachines that  discipline, punish or even pamper \nthe flesh are neither disembodied mechanisms endowe d with a runaway science-fiction \npower, nor are they really remote-controlled by wil y manufacturers or obscure societal \nforces. 227  Instead, they are to a large extent consciously an d wilfully integrated by \nconsumers into their everyday lives. Surveillance h as thus been very effectively delegated to \nthe self. Jardine fittingly quotes Bob Somol, a pro fessor at UIC\u2019s [University of Illinois at \nChicago] School of Architecture, who states that \u201c\u2026we are rather in a mode of self-\nsurveillance: we watch ourselves as someone else.\u201d 228   \n \nWith HLTs, the internalisation of control goes even  a step further than the inward-turned \ngaze, it is also reflected in the individual choice  of surveillance tools: \u201cWhoever pursues \nwellness, finds and designs her/his own needs and d esired states -which then become a \nyardstick for comprehensive self-development- and u ses individually chosen methods to \nattain this aim.\u201d 229  But a double caveat should be raised here: first o f all, even if the \ninvention of needs and desires as well as the fixes  selected seem to be left to consumers\u2019 \nprovince, health commodification spells the emergen ce of an internalised imperative to \npursue well-being at almost any cost. And if the di agnosis and the tools are individualised, \n                                                 \n225  Jardine, Alice, Discussions in Contemporary Culture , op. cit., p.152. \n226  For more on cultural landscapes, cf.

As  Stefanie Duttweiler words it:  \n \nFrom the wellness perspective, technologies of the self are thus instances of a process \nrequiring a number of pre-conditions: one must see oneself as in need of change, choose the \nappropriate technologies and apply them situational ly, implement the instructions and finally \nproduce a result, enabling one to state that one fe els well. 230   \n \nTherefore, the balance of power in HLTs is quite su btle: even if most of their characteristics \n(such as the primacy of individual health, well-bei ng and sensuous gratification, their mix-n-\nmatch quality as well as their flexible tailoring) seem to point towards a maximum \nautonomisation of the subject, this autonomy is onl y that of a consumer. Indeed, the late \nmodern subject is exposed to a double bind: not onl y is s/he, as a citizen, still controlled by \nmore or less repressive state technologies but, as a consumer, s/he is also monitored (and \nsteered) by economically-driven institutions (e.g. transnational corporations), whose \ninterests are best served when consumers believe th at they have the choice to define \nthemselves. \n \nThus, since most HLTs seem to be voluntarily  embodied in one way or another, it appears \ndifficult to envision freedom from technological en croachments, hence also a gradual \nabatement of self-surveillance. Rather, it seems mo re likely that both the encroachment and \nthe surveillance processes will be continually re-n egotiated in individual, localised versions \nof embodiment:    \n \nEmbodiment, however, is always relativistic in the sense that it is a relation between the \nhuman and the technologies employed. What stands ou t first is that all human-technology \nrelations are two-way relations. Insofar as I use o r employ a technology, I am used by and \nemployed by that technology as well. [\u2026] In the sec ond place, through our various journeys it \ncan be seen that bodies, our bodies, adapt to diffe rent kinds of technologies and \ntechnological contexts. [\u2026] This range of adaptatio n to our machines, however, is not infinite \nor totally malleable. It reaches limits and has str uctural aspects [\u2026] the technologies must \nalso adapt to us. [\u2026] We are our bodies \u2013 but in th at very basic notion one also discovers that \nour bodies have an amazing plasticity and polymorph ism that is often brought out precisely \nin our relations with technologies. We are bodies i n technologies. 231  \n \nFor a historian of technology, this triggers the qu estion of when this vision of our \u201cbodies in \ntechnology\u201d actually arose. Did it already accompan y humankind from its first experiments \nwith sticks and stones or with tattoos, piercing an d scarification? Because my expertise does \nnot extend to paleoanthropology, I will have to lim it my observations to more recent times. \nTim Armstrong contends that modernism is \u201c characterized by the desire to intervene  in the \nbody; to render it part of modernity by techniques which may be biological, mechanical or \nbehavioural\u201d. 232  But these types of intervention in the body go hand  in hand with, indeed \n                                                 \n230  Ibid., p. 270. \u201eSelbsttechnologien im Modus der Wellness sind somi t Momente eines voraussetzungsvollen \nProzesse: Man muss sich als ver\u00e4nderungsbed\u00fcrftig b egreifen, die richtigen Techniken ausw\u00e4hlen und ihr en \nEinsatz situativ entscheiden, die Anweisungen umset zen und letztlich ein Ergebnis produzieren, von dem  man \nsagen kann, man f\u00fchle sich wohl.\u201c  \n231  Ihde, Don, op. cit., pp. 137-138. \n232  Armstrong, Tim, Modernism, Technology and the Body: a cultural stud y , Cambridge: Cambridge University \nPress, 1998, p. 6. 67 \n \nthey actually depend on the acceptance of a new cul tural metaphor, that of the body as \nmachine , a body that can be correspondingly mechanically s erviced and maintained. While \nshe mentions androids or automata as precursors of biological mechanism, Maria Ossietzki \nlocates the hybridism of the body in the 19 th  century \u201cat the latest in the course of \nindustrialisation and the technicization of medicin e\u201d .233  This is corroborated by Carolyn \nThomas de la Pe\u00f1a, who after tracing back the analo gy of body as machine  to Descartes, \nquotes a number of popular American publications th at repeatedly drew on this simile from \nthe mid-19 th  century onwards in the U.S.: \n \nSuch human-machine comparisons were not new, but th ey did represent a fundamental shift \nin how individuals viewed their physical frames. En lightenment philosophers and physicians \nhad speculated that the body might be a rational co llection of mechanized parts. Yet their \nunderstanding of the body as machine-like was a mea ns to understand the body, not to \nimprove upon it. By 1860, machines analogies were n ot merely being used to describe \ncomplex physiology to a general audience. They also  began to reflect a popular belief that \nmachines could improve upon God\u2019s given body. 234  \n \nThere again, while wholeheartedly subscribing to th is \u201cimprovement belief\u201d (which can be \nperceived as one of the last contemporary remnants of a positivist approach to \ntechnology), 235  HLTs adopt a hybrid position that brazenly blurs b oundaries.

Indee d, nowadays technology is only \nhaltingly perceived as a harbinger of progress sinc e its unintended side-effects often \noverwhelm us:   \n \nPeoples who no longer dare eat meat for fear they w ill become mad, who no longer dare to \nmake love for fear of falling sick, and who no long er dare press the nozzle of an aerosol for \nfear the sky will fall upon their heads are no long er either modern, post-modern or \nbarbarian: they have gone back to a shared humanity , to what anthropology has always \ndescribed as pertaining to \u201cthe others\u201d. When one d ecides to blend human societies and an \neven broader society of objects, prions, neutrinos,  viruses, microchips and cabled networks \nwithin a common collective life, one has to \u201cwatch out\u201d, one has to be aware of every \nconnection.

(1989), the machine metaphor, borro wed from theories in cognitive psychology, is proba bly the \nmost prominent theme in consumer research and liken s humans to information-processing devices. The \ndominance of the machine metaphor is also evidence of the silence regarding the body in consumer resea rch. \nWe argue that we study consumption, typically an ac tivity associated with the animate body, yet we sha pe our \nthinking with metaphors that portray consumers as i nanimate machines.\u201d (p. 335)  \n239  Latour, Bruno, \u00ab La modernit\u00e9 est termin\u00e9e \u00bb, arti cle originally published in Le Monde  on August 28th, 1996, \navailable online: http://www.bruno-latour.fr/presse/presse_art/002.ht ml . \u00abDes peuples qui n'osent plus \nmanger de la viande de peur de devenir fous, qui n' osent plus faire l'amour de peur de se rendre malad es, qui \nn'osent plus presser le bouton d'un a\u00e9rosol de peur  que le ciel ne leur tombe sur la t\u00eate, ne sont plu s ni \nmodernes, ni post-modernes, ni barbares; ils sont r evenus \u00e0 la commune humanit\u00e9, \u00e0 ce que l'anthropolo gie a \ntoujours d\u00e9crit chez \"les autres\".

[website access ed Aug. 2011] 69 \n \nThus, the body and its HLTs do not escape this gene ral scrutiny of technology. If the shift \nfrom an \u201cindustrial\u201d to a so-called \u201cpost-industria l\u201d 240  society seems to imply that the body \nhas changed from a factor of production to a factor  of consumption and that that there is \nalmost nothing left to industrialise but the flesh,  this step is carried out with a fearful \nenthusiasm. HLTs are designed and perceived in a co rresponding light: for example, the \naerobic or jogging excesses of the Jane Fonda gener ation are both smugly and concernedly \ndismissed by proponents of more \u201csoftcore\u201d wellness  technologies. But do the latter remain \ndistinct from human bodies or not? Latour again, in  his endeavours to blur boundaries \nbetween sclerotic categories, suggests that drawing  the line between \u201cus\u201d humans as \nsovereign subjects and \u201cthem\u201d technologies as subor dinate objects is rather futile:  \n \nWithout technical detours, there is no \u00ab real \u00bb hum an. More seriously, this has been \nillustrated by innumerable studies that range from ergonomics to technology, through \nLaurent Th\u00e9venot\u2019s remarkable efforts to classify t he modes of action: the techniques that \nbombard human beings with a continuous offer of inc redible positions \u2013grips, suggestions, \npermissions, prohibitions, habits, positions, alien ations, prescriptions, calculations, \nmemories. By generalising the notion of affordance,  we can say that, as quasi-subjects, we \nbecome so thanks to quasi-objects that people our u niverse with little ghosts of beings \nsimilar to us \u2013 whose scripts we take over or not. 241  \n \nEdward Tenner describes the situation even more poi ntedly as it pertains to body \ntechnologies: \u201cWhen we use simple devices to move, position, exte nd, or protect our bodies, \nour techniques change both objects and bodies. And by adopting devices we do more. We \nchange our social selves.\u201d 242  But it is Donna Haraway who takes the most radical stance in \nthe debate on body/technology fusion with her under standing of the cyborg as a potent \npolitical affirmation: \u201c[M]y cyborg myth is about transgressed boundaries,  potent fusions, \nand dangerous possibilities which progressive peopl e might explore as one part of needed \npolitical work.\u201d 243  However, in contrast with the producers, mediators  and users of invasive \nmedical technologies such as cosmetic surgery, comp uter-steered cyborgian experiments \n(like those of Steve Mann, a Canadian professor of computer engineering) 244  or radical body \n                                                 \n240  Although, as Chaia Heller rightly argues: \u201c[\u2026] there is nothing so \u2018post\u2019 about \u2018post-industr ialism\u2019: First World \ncountries are still \u2018industrial;\u2019 they just moved t heir industrial infrastructure to the Third World.\u201d  Cf.

Instead of trumpeting \nthe merging of human and machine, they prefer to mo re or less consciously disguise the \ntechnologies they design, promote and consume with a comfortably \u201cnatural\u201d sugar-coating \nthat will blend in with a \u201cnaturalised\u201d aesthetics of everyday life.  \n \nHence technology in the realm of my dissertation is  understood as the technological  that can \nbe found in artefacts (both products and appliances ), processes, techniques, routines, \nsensations, emotions, experience and knowledge that  users can appropriate to consciously \ndesign and influence the health and well-being of t heir bodies in everyday life. The \ninclusiveness of my definition is purposeful: from a consumer perspective and in an \nincreasingly holistic paradigm, it has become very difficult to distinguish between industrial \nproducts and the experiences they help to induce or  between appliances and specific bodily \ntechniques which are supposed to enhance the effect s of these appliances. Moreover, the \nholistic body as a consumer, mediator and (co-)prod ucer of technology does not necessarily \ndistinguish between a process and the sensation or experience it evokes since HLTs, more \nthan any other technologies, are conceived as \u2018live d/living technologies\u2019.  \n \nFinally, even if in this context I consciously avoi d analysing the above-mentioned more \n\u201cradical\u201d realms of body technology, I remain sensi tive to all the dimensions that they \nuncover. Indeed, in the case of HLTs, it is not bec ause the body-technology merger is quieter \nthat it is less fundamental. On the contrary, HLTs have a way of creeping up on us, discreetly \nbut surely transforming us into tomorrow\u2019s more mai nstream cyborgs. In this context, inputs \nfrom Mike Michael\u2019s book \u201cReconnecting Culture, Technology and Nature\u201d  are of particular \nrelevance. His study focuses on what he defines as mundane  (in contrast with exotic ) \ntechnologies and their contribution to the creation  of hybrid entities he calls \u201cco(a)gents\u201d . \nAmong others, his case-studies include the role of walking boots, automobiles or the remote \ncontrol in the creation of respectively the \u201cseeker of natural sublime\u201d , the \u201croad rager\u201d  or \nthe \u201ccouch potato\u201d.  In the wake of Bruno Latour, he contends that: \n \nThere are no humans in the world. Or rather, humans  are fabricated \u2013 in language, through \ndiscursive formations, in their various liaisons wi th technological and natural actors, across \nnetworks that are heterogeneously comprised of huma ns and non-humans who are \nthemselves so comprised. Instead of humans and non- humans we are beginning to think \nabout flows, movements, arrangements, relations. It  is through such dynamics that the \nhuman (and the non-human) emerges. 245  \n \nIn the process of unravelling the articulations of these co(a)gents \u2013where \u201cspecific \ntechnologies, bits of bodies, aspects of nature, pa rts of culture , and traditions of discourse \ncome together\u201d \u2013246  Michael exposes the overlaps and the limits of cat egories such as \n\u201cculture\u201d, \u201ctechnology\u201d and \u201cnature\u201d. In parallel, disciplinary boundaries that rely on a \ncareful delimitation of these categories are denoun ced as too constricting since they are \nincapable of individually providing a satisfactory analysis of co(a)gents . Similarly, HLTs can be \nseen as contributing to co(agents) such as the \u201cfit ness freak\u201d, the \u201chealth geek\u201d, the \n\u201cwellness guru\u201d \u2013or more generally the \u201clifestyle-c onscious consumer\u201d. However, even if \nthey remain relatively unobtrusive, these construct ions are far from innocuous. Indeed, from \n                                                 \n245  Michael, Mike, Reconnecting Culture, Technology and Nature , Routledge: London & New York, 2000, p. 1. \n246  Ibid., p. 2 71 \n \na political perspective, the appropriation of \u201csoft er\u201d body technologies raises just as many \nquestions about the wielding of power as more invas ive techniques: they may seem self-\nchosen, self-imposed, and subjectively internalised  but they nevertheless betray our visions \nof nature, science, society, risk, expertise, commo dification, pleasure and aestheticisation, \nnot to mention normalcy, disease, disability, obsol escence, death and\u2026 transcendence.  \n \nThus, as hinted at in the last section, the  technological, whether object- or subject-centred, \nprovides us with an indispensable tool (!) to gauge  the meanders of our evolution:   \n  \nIn the history of technology we discover ourselves as both technically active and the objects \nof technical action and we thus question the proble ms that these actions raise for us and for \nour societies. Our aim is to understand the technol ogical dimension of our lives against the \nbackground of the intellectual as well as material manifestations handed down to us through \npast technological actions as well as of current ma nifestations in the transformation \nprocesses of the present.247  \n \nBy taking stock of the evolving entanglement of tec hnology and human activity as well as its \nperception, this section will have hopefully contri buted to a dynamic understanding of \nbodies in technology , of the technological in bodies  or, maybe more succinctly, of techno-\nbodies . In fact, it is perhaps the concept of somatechnics  as expounded by the \n\u201cSomatechnics Research Center\u201d at Sydney\u2019s Macquari e University that best encapsulates \nthe relationship between technologies and the body:  \n \n\u2018Somatechnics\u2019 is a newly coined term used to highl ight the inextricability of soma and \ntechne, of the body (as a culturally intelligible c onstruct) and the techniques (dispositifs and \n'hard technologies') in and through which bodies ar e formed and transformed. This term, \nthen, supplants the logic of the 'and', indicating that technologies are not something we add \nto or apply to the body, but rather, are the means in and through which bodies are \nconstituted, positioned, and lived. As such, the te rm reflects contemporary understandings \nof the body as the incarnation or materialization o f historically and culturally specific \ndiscourses and practices. 248   \n \nThe next section will then chart the role of commod ification as it actively reinforces and \njustifies this melding process.  \n  \nCommodification  \n \nWhat is most remarkable, however, isn't merely the way that the market has triumphed as \nthe dominant form of economic organization, but rat her the way that commodification--the \nprocess of transforming things into objects for sal e--has also become a dominant and \ntotalizing cultural force. We live not only in a ma rket economy, but in a market society, where \n                                                 \n247  Wengenroth, Ulrich, \u201eWas ist Technikgeschichte?\u201c, teaching material: working paper, cf. \nhttp://www.fggt.edu.tum.de/personen/ulrich-wengenro th/wengenroth-lehrveranstaltungen/was-ist-\ntechnikgeschichte/ : \u201cWir erfahren uns in der Technikgeschichte als tech nisch Handelnde ebenso wie als Objekte \ntechnischer Handlungen und fragen dabei nach den Pr oblemen, die Ver\u00e4nderungen dieser Handlungen f\u00fcr un s \nund unsere Gesellschaften aufwerfen.

[website accessed Aug. 2011] 72 \n \nthe market and its categories of thought have come to dominate ever more areas of our lives. \nMany universities now think of the education that t hey offer as a \"product\" that they need to \npitch to their student \"consumers.\" Increasingly, n ew advances in biotechnology make \npossible the commodification of our offspring or ou r very bodies. While commodification is \ncertainly not a recent innovation, what is new is i ts size, dimension, scope, and power. It has \nbecome intensified and institutionalized in new and  far-reaching ways, carrying meanings \nthat reconfigure our understanding of the world and  our place within it. Everything can \nbecome a commodity now, and almost nothing is unaff ected by the appropriation of the \nmarket paradigm. 249  \n \nI chose commodification instead of consumption in m y dissertation title because beyond the \nintegration of HLTs in everyday life, I am even mor e interested in the forces that, under a \nmyriad of guises, conspire to make us buy (into) we llbeing. I find the use of this concept very \nprofitable in this study because it enables me to u ncover a number of concrete and symbolic \nstrategies used to transform apparently \u201cnormalised \u201d or \u201cdomesticated\u201d foodstuffs, \ncosmetics, movement routines or alternative health practices into healthy lifestyle \ntechnologies (HLTs).  In this section, I will therefore try to clarify th e main implications of \ncommodification for HLTs by emphasising its boundar y-breaking characteristics. I will then \nintroduce the master metaphor \u2013namely recombinance\u2013  that will guide my investigation \ninto contemporary commodification and its strategie s. This metaphor, loosely inspired by \nthe genetic model, will enable me to show that the contemporary production, mediation \nand consumption of goods and especially services ar e dominated by a commodified and \ntranscultural ethic of admixture. First, I will exa mine recombinance at work in novel products \nand the ideologies that underpin them, before focus ing on how it affects individuals, blurring \nthe boundaries between lay and professional. I will  then move on to show how it powers a \ndecentralisation of knowledge hence power, whilst n evertheless coercing individuals to take \naction and accept responsibility for it. This empha sis on the individual implies a \nsubjectivisation of the health offer, in terms of e motion and experience \u2013in sum, the \nrecognition that personal rationality overrides sci entific or technical rationality. Offers are \nthus tailored to encompass emotional and experienti al dimensions that emphasise a shift \nfrom health to well-being. Finally, using a tea exa mple, I then show how semiotic work \nrather than technological innovativeness ultimately  determines the successful \ntransformation of generic goods into HLTs.  \nAs stated in the introductory quote, commodities (h ence commodification or \ncommoditisation) are not a new phenomenon, be it in  the common business sense 250  or the \n                                                 \n249  Web-announcement for \u201cThe commodification of everything\u201d , a colloquium organised by the Institute for \nAdvanced Studies in Culture at the University of Vi rginia in the Spring of 2003: http://www.iasc-\nculture.org/old_site/colloquia2003.html  [website originally accessed in October 2006.

[websit e accessed Aug. 2011] 73 \n \nsense developed by Karl Marx. 251  But it is the contemporary transformation process of non-\ncommodities into commodities that is particularly a rresting. 252  At first glance, this process \nmay seem quite straightforward and neutral: i.e. th e transformation of some \u201cthing\u201d or \ndimension into a commodity: \u201c The process of commodification might be seen as bou ndary \nwork--behind our classes of everyday objects are pa tterns of division and subdivision of \nnaturally fuzzy concepts into portable, exchangeabl e portions of value.\u201d 253   \nHowever in the popular imagination, this boundary w ork is often negatively connotated for \nat least three reasons. First, it implies a form of  surfeit linked to a reproduction effect. For \nexample, soap as a traditionally homemade household  product was transformed into a \ngeneric commodity through industrial mass-productio n in the course of the 19 th  century. \nFurther branding and product differentiation (e.g. bath soap, facial soap, baby soap, soap for \nsensitive skins, liquid soap, soap suds, scented so ap, hypo-allergenic soap, etc.) then \ngradually transformed a relatively basic and limite d assortment into an almost overwhelming \noffer of soap options. 254  Linked to this surfeit, the second problematic asp ect of \ncommodification is finding new markets within or be yond the domestic market once an \ninitial saturation level has been reached. This imp lies expensive R&D investments or complex \nmarketing strategies often involving more or less c overt and devious ideological/political \nagendas. 255  The third contentious dimension of commodification  is what is usually perceived \n                                                 \n251  Cf. especially Book 1 (Capitalist Production). Par t 1 (Commodities and money), Chapter 1 (Commodities ), of \nMarx, Karl, Capital: A Critique of Political Economy , [First edition: 1867 in German, 1887 in English],  a very \nrecent English edition was published by e.g. Seattl e: Pacific Publishing Studio, 2010. I refer here to  an online \nPDF version ( http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download /pdf/Capital-Volume-I.pdf ), pp. 26-46. \nObviously, it is difficult to condense a concept de veloped at length but I like the summary provided h ere \n(http://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/marxism/te rms/commodity.html ): \u201cCOMMODITY: \"an external \nobject, a thing which through its qualities satisfi es human needs of whatever kind\" (Marx, Capital  125) and is \nthen exchanged for something else. When Marx speaks  of commodities, he is particularly concerned with the \n\"physical properties of the commodity\" (126), which  he associates closely with the use-value of an obj ect. \nHowever, use-value does not automatically lead to a  commodity: \"He who satisfies his own need with the  \nproduct of his own labour admittedly creates use-va lues, but not commodities. In order to produce the latter, he \nmust not only produce use-values , but use-values  for others, social use-values \" (131). Commodities, therefore, \n\"possess a double form, i.e. natural form and value  form\" (138). ( See Use-Value vs. Exchange-Value .) The \nphysical body of the commodity is made up of 1) the  material provided by nature (e.g. linen, gold, etc .); and 2) \nthe labor expended to create it (see Marx, Capital  133). Note that a commodity can refer to tangilble  [sic]  things \nas well as more ephemeral products (e.g. a lecture) . What matters is that something be exchanged for t he \nthing.\u201d  [websites accessed Aug. 2011] \n252  The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines \u201ccom modify\u201d as \u201cto turn (as an intrinsic value or a work of \nart) into a commodity\u201d .

Fo r 74 \n \nas a form of degrading reification. Reification here should be understood in the Marxis t \nsense, i.e. the transfer of human qualities to thin gs but conversely also the transformation of \nhuman beings into things. 256  Thus reification is probably the most disturbing c haracteristic of \ncommodification since it opens the door to the merc handising of the body and its parts, of \nhealth as well as of experience and emotions, as ap tly described in this definition of \ncommodification as:  \n \n[...] the subordination of public and private realm s to the logic of capitalism. In other words, \nto say certain things (e.g., friendship, women) hav e become \"commodified\" is to say they are \nnow valued primarily for their commercial value. Wi th commodification aspects of our lives \nthat are culturally conditioned take on the mytholo gy of being \"natural\" but their continued \nappreciation is dependent on their commercial value . 257    \n \nHence, commodities do not just happen, they are made  in the merging between what \nproducers or mediators think is the appropriate wor th of a product or service and what \nconsumers are prepared to pay for. 258  Thus, commodification entails an agreement about \nvalue ascription \u2013resting on notions such as scarci ty, need, want, luxury etc. In the case of \n                                                                                                                                                         \nvarious documents on this problem and its more rece nt ramifications: cf. \nhttp://www.babymilkaction.org/pages/history.html ; http://www.babymilkaction.org/pdfs/nprme05web.pdf ; \nhttp://www.ibfan.org/newsletters-world-asia-nestle. html .

To draw upon the soap example again, the \nformer aspect can be frequently witnessed in advert isements where a piece of soap is endowed with \n(super)human capacities such as relaxation, stimula tion or enlightenment (witness the examples mention ed in \nmy introduction). The second aspect is particularly  highlighted in the historical controversies surrou nding \nalleged National-Socialist soap-manufacturing invol ving human fat, cf. e.g. \nhttp://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/dachau/ legends/soap.htm .

As social interactions increasingly takes on the  form of \ncommodity exchange, individuals are faced with anxi eties concerning their market value, and the rate o f \nconversion for their physical capital. And as with the physical culture of the nineteenth century, the  primary site \nof the resolution of such anxieties remains the phy sical body.\u201d [website accessed Aug. 2011] \n258  Cf. also my discussion of the \u201cuses and gratificat ions\u201d approach in Chapter 2 ( Methodology ). Moreover, the \nfact that commodities are created also means that t heir value is relative and can thus fluctuate over time, \ndepending on social and environmental circumstances  as well as other values (both immaterial and mater ial, \ni.e. including other commodities). However, as emph asised by anthropologists Arjun Appadurai and Igor \nKopytoff in their \u201csocial/cultural life/biography o f things\u201d concept, commodification is not irreversi ble: just as \nthings (or people) can become commodities, commodit ies can also regain a non-commodified status. Cf. \nKopytoff, Igor: \u201cThe cultural biography of things: commoditization as process\u201c, in: The social life of things. \nCommodities in cultural perspective , Ed. Arjun Appadurai, Cambridge & New York: CUP, 1 986, pp. 64-91. 75 \n \nhuman commodification, however, the arbitrariness o f value ascription may appear much \nmore blatant. Indeed, if at a given time in a given  society, relatively stable exchange values \ncan be negotiated and decided upon for a pound of r ice, a plot of land or a computer, who \ncan claim to convincingly and lastingly define the relative worth of a donated kidney, of a \nsiliconed breast, of slimness, companionship, beaut y, pleasure or good health, since their \nvalue oscillates between \u201ccultural\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d a ssumptions? The trick with the \ncommodification of body parts or more immaterial hu man aptitudes and values is that it \nrequires the subjective consent AND collaboration 259  of consumers even more than material \ngoods do. While a pound of rice or a washing machin e may remain commodities even when \nstocked unsold in a warehouse, the former can only access commodity status when \nconsumers are willing to ascribe a relative value t o them by metaphorically and literally \nbuying (into) them. With the outsourcing of \u201cwester n\u201d industrial production to transition \nand emerging economies, this particular form of com modification has been eagerly \nembraced by increasingly service-oriented economies . Indeed, since goods can no longer be \nmanufactured cheaply enough in the \u201cwest\u201d, westerni sed economies are forced to shift \n\u201cvalue-making\u201d to another level. Increasingly the s heer material qualities of the products or \nservices offered recede behind their human evocativ e potential, thus smoothly paving the \ntransition from \u201cobject\u201d to \u201csubject\u201d commodificati on. 260   \nHowever, to come back to my soap example, it does n ot mean that ingredients and their \nprovenance, textures, fragrances or other physical- chemical properties no longer matter \nsince many cosmetic businesses owe at least some of  their success to labels such as \n\u201corganic\u201d, \u201cfair-trade\u201d, \u201cnot tested on animals\u201d, \u201c free of artificial fragrances and/or \npreservatives\u201d, etc. But in an increasingly franchi sed economy, with cosmetics and soap \nboutiques spreading globally, traditional soap-make rs such as Yardley ,261  Crabtree & \nEvelyn ,262  L\u2019Occitane 263  or even The Body Shop 264  have to contend with the arrival of the likes \nof Lush 265  whose concept stores have taken the world by storm . The Lush experience begins \neven before unsuspecting potential customers enter the shop: walking past, one cannot help \nbut be arrested by the colourful stacks of fun-look ing objects in every conceivable variety \u2013\nreminiscent of a lively market stand. 266  A closer look at the products reveals that one is not \nstaring at hunks of freshly cut mature Emmenthal, m outh-watering sherbet, slices of \n                                                 \n259  Obviously, phenomena such as organ trafficking or pornography may impose rather than enrol individual  \nconsent and collaboration.  \n260  For the commodification of emotions in the service  economy, cf. e.g. Hochschild, Arlie Russell, The Managed \nHeart: the Commercialization of Human Feeling , Berkeley: The University of California Press, 198 3 [Reprinted \nwith new afterword, 2003]; Rastetter, Daniela.

Soap is sold in \nwedges that do indeed look like cheese, priced by w eight and wrapped in greaseproof paper. \u2018Bath bombs \u2019 are \npiled up like fruit; butter cream looks more like a  mouth-watering cake than shower soap.\u201d  76 \n \nbirthday cake or strange hand grenades, but that th ese products are more likely to be Honey \nI Washed the Kids  soap, Creamed Almond and Coconut Smoothie shower soap, or a \nBlackberry Bath Bomb .267  If to-be customers survive the almost overpowering  fragrance \nwave upon entering the store, they might get to fin ger and sniff at the products closely \nbefore reading more about them. For example, what l ooks like a piece of bicolour candy is \nactually The Comforter Bubble . Its effects are described as follows: \u201cWraps you in a fluffy \npink blanket of blackberry bubbles to keep you safe  and warm.\u201d268  A host of other examples \nin the assortment have been endowed with similar hu manoid or esoteric characteristics \u2013\nfrom Ne Worry Pas  Bath Ballistic  that is designed with a \u201cmagic grotto\u201d  in which you can \nwhisper your worries and \u201cthen let them dissolve away\u201d 269  to the almost self-explanatory \nTea and Sympathy .270   \nLush Products are a good example of the trend that is tr ansforming relatively \nstraightforward products into holistic services tha t draw on and mix a number of registers to \nappeal to their clientele. I would therefore like t o introduce a simile that I find extremely \nhelpful to understand how these new service product s are designed and what strategies are \nused to power this new type of commodification. In an article on biotechnology in the age of \ninformational capital, 271  Chaia Heller makes a convincing case for the adopt ion and \nadaptation of the genetic recombinance  metaphor. 272  After characterising service production \nin the post-industrial age as relying \u201c[\u2026] on national and global expansion of service \nproduction through standardized, franchised chain-s tore formations and the transformation \nof service commodities into patentable information\u201d273  \u2013thus shifting the emphasis from \nproduct to practice\u2013 Heller argues that:  \n                                                 \n267  All examples were drawn from the German Lush websi te: http://www.lush-shop.de/ . On the smell of the \ncosmetics, cf. Teather, David, op. cit.: \u201c Ingredients are mostly natural, nothing is tested o n animals and \npackaging avoided where possible. \u2018The reason it sm ells so strong is that if you are going to take all  the \npackaging off cosmetics, you can smell it,\u2019 says Ma rk. \u2018So I didn't think, lets make it really smelly and that'll \nadvertise it.

In Germany, however, franc hising is not yet as dominant in the field of healt h \ntechnologies and systems, as it is in e.g. the food  or personnel domains. In February 2006, a cursive glance \nthrough the virtual fairground of a franchising web site revealed the following figures: out of 179 fra nchising 77 \n \n \nIf rationalization and homogenization are the hallm arks of industrial capitalism, then \nrecombinance  is the emblem of informational capitalism. Recombi nance is a productive \nmodality characterized by the continual re-melding of architecture, graphic design, radio, \ntelevision, and film that have come to constitute t he spectacular stage. Within recombinant \nproduction, the assembly line is reversed to create  the \u2018anti-assembly line\u2019. Whereas the \nFordist assembly line moved in a linear direction f rom \u2018standardized parts\u2019 to create \u2018unified \nwholes\u2019, the post-Fordist anti-assembly line rearra nges unified wholes to create a pastiche of \ninformational parts. [\u2026] Recombinance provides the flexibility required by a standardized \nservice industry, furnishing the informational 'mov eable joints' for the production [of] \notherwise rigid and homogenous service commodities.274  \n \nWhilst taking fast food in general, and hamburgers in particular, as prominent examples of \nthis kind of production, the author moves on to sho w how the metaphor functions perhaps \neven more strikingly in the cultural domain where:  \n \n[\u2026] signs and symbols are [extracted] from various cultural moments to create wholes \ncomprised of components that often share no common history or development. Within \nrecombinant production, cultural artifacts are redu ced to information bits to be cut and \nspliced together to create novel commodities. 275  \n \nThus what applies to hamburgers or trademarked coff ee specialities can be seen as \ncharacterising an increasing number of phenomena su ch as techno music, clothes design, \nsoftware, TV variety shows and\u2026 health. 276  But what distinguishes this type of flexible \nrecombinance from previously more localised hybrid cultural production is the fact that it is \nprimarily profit-driven, whilst seeking transcultur al validation and appropriation. 277  For \n                                                                                                                                                         \ncompanies presented only 17 had something to do wit h health and beauty (taking all sun parlours and be auty \ninstitutes into account).

[website accessed Aug. 2011] \n274  Heller, Chaia, op. cit.  \n275  Ibid.  \n276  Interestingly, Barry Glassner comes to a similar c onclusion, when analysing fitness as a post-modern pursuit. \nInstead of \u201crecombinance\u201d, he has recourse to the f amous \u201cpastiche\u201d metaphor that he defines as \u201c[...] a \nborrowing from diverse imagery, styles and traditio ns, including both high and low, commercial and art istic, \nand past, present, and future, wherever these seem usable. Such pastiche is a form of contextless quot ation \n[...]\u201d  along with the idea of simulacrum, i.e. \u201c[...] representations for which there are no origi nal\u201d [Glassner then \nquotes the exercise video as a case in point]. Cf. Glassner, Barry, \u201cFitness and the Postmodern Self\u201d,  op. cit., p. \n181 & p. 184. Personally, I prefer the term \u201crecomb inance\u201d term to \u201cpastiche\u201d, first because it appear s less \ncritically (or \u201cpost-modernly\u201d) loaded and second b ecause, to my mind, it more clearly encapsulates th e \nprecisely engineered  (if not classically scientific) post-industrial ap proach to product and service creation.   \n277  Cf. Heller, Chaia, op.cit.: \u201cYet, we cannot base a critique of recombinant cult ure on a static notion of cultural \nintegrity or purity. It is vital to distinguish com modified recombinance from the forms of spontaneous  collective \nsynthesis that are integral to all cultural practic e. As the field of anthropology has acknowledged in  recent \nyears, culture-making has always been a hybrid proc ess, a continually developing synthesis of informat ion, \nlanguage, and identity that emerges within and betw een peoples of different populations and cultures. Rather, \nit is the primacy of profit-driven recombinance, as  a principal form of capital-intensive production, over non-\ncommodified forms of local, fluid, and hybrid cultu ral production, that is problematic. Of great conce rn is the \ndeclining tension between holistic and local forms of cultural generativity and moments of translocal 78 \n \ninstance, the contemporary health offer is so domin ated by globalizing and commodifying \ninfluences that it enables a splicing and braiding of almost all prior ethics of self-care. \n \nThe scale and the programmatic nature of this commo dified recombinance are particularly \nimpressive since recombinance has become a must for  products and services to survive in a \nglobalising economy. What applies to the symbolic l evels is also translated to the material \nlevel, i.e. there are almost no technological \u201cbree ding\u201d taboos left. For instance, many \ntraditionally produced and personally-tailored Ayur vedic or Traditional Chinese Medicine \nproducts or practices \u2013meant to be used within a co hesive healing system\u2013 are often mass-\nproduced and marketed in combination with completel y heterogeneous therapies (including \nwestern allopathic remedies). In this respect, I un earthed two good and rather amusing \nexamples of this creolisation phenomenon. On the Ge rman side, I chanced upon the website \nof a self-proclaimed Ayurveda Centre  advertising a number of \u201ctraditional\u201d Ayurvedic \nproducts and treatments alongside a Legacy of the Mayas  face and body cream as well as \ncosmetics from the Indian Spirit  line developed together with Lakota Indians. 278  A few \nthousands of miles East, a wellness sanctuary in Ch ennai (formerly Madras) \u2013offering \nBalinese, Thai, Shiatsu and Swedish massage, alongs ide Australian organic cosmetics \ndesigned by a German couple\u2013 was being reviewed in the online edition of the Indian \nnewspaper The Hindu .279  The globalised creolisation of well-being is bound  to make even a \ndetached observer a little giddy\u2026   \n \nPursuing the development of the recombinance  metaphor, Heller moves from an analysis of \nrecombinant products to the praxis level, involving  both producers and consumers. Using \nthe entertainment industry as an example, she descr ibes how the metaphor translates into a \nform of deskilling-reskilling process: traditional artists are gradually being replaced by \n\u201cengineers\u201d who design \u201cpatchwork\u201d art by \u201cselecting, manipulating, and synthesizing bits of \ntext or image to create textual novelties.\u201d  280  The resulting hybrid products are suitable for \nvery heterogeneous contexts and tend to breed a new  generation of \u201ccreator-consumers\u201d \nwho are more and more comfortable with both passive  and active \u201csampling\u201d. Indeed, \nrecombinance as an increasingly hegemonic productiv e modality encourages consumers to \nbecome apprentice \u201crecombiners\u201d themselves through the elaboration of personal \ncompilations or more semi-professional dabbling. 281  More pointedly, in an increasingly \n                                                                                                                                                         \ncommodified recombinant production and consumption.  The shift of capital toward an elastic and limitle ss \nproduction of recombinant informational service pro ducts flags a sharp curve in the capitalist road.\u201d  \n278  Cf. http://www.ayurveda-muenchen.de/data/index.shtml .

[website accessed Aug. 2011] \n280  Cf. Heller, Chaia, op. cit.   \n281  In this respect, the contemporary electronic music  scene is particularly emblematic. This type of mus ic is a \ncollage of so-called \u201cmusic loops\u201d and various soun ds crafted or sampled by DJs and can be more or les s \npassively enjoyed in a number of music clubs. But l ay-users are increasingly encouraged to become \u201csou nd \nengineers\u201d and produce their own homemade musical f orms. This process is enabled by the increasing \navailability and cheapness of relatively user-frien dly musical software and synthesizers that make hom e \nexperimenting fairly accessible. Moreover, innovati ve electronic jamming sessions encourage the artist ic \n\u201ccoming-out\u201d of lay-users while providing increased  visibility for more experienced musicians \u2013without  the \nstress of formal gigs or DJing. A good example is t he \u201cSpheric Lounge live ambient music\u201d session that  takes \nplace once a month in an alternative Munich club: c f. http://www.sphericlounge.de/ . The sessions there \ninclude productions from so-calles VJs, i.e. video jockeys, who design the visual counterpart of the m usic, by 79 \n \ncommodified paradigm where hybrid production is poi sed to outweigh all forms of \ntraditional production, consumers are de facto coer ced to submit to the recombinance ethic. \nIndeed, by incorporating hybrid goods and services from various producers into their \npractices and routines \u2013endowing them in passing wi th additional, more personal meanings\u2013 \nthey end up creating hybrid lifestyles. \n \nThere again, this development is particularly obvio us in the health realm: healthcare \nmarketers (whether state-, corporate-, or more indi vidually based) have multiplied and \nhybridised to such an extent that there is no one c redible, overarching figure, institution or \ntheory that can serve as a role model or reference for an increasingly multifarious if \nglobalised community. Actually, the very success of  fitness and wellness resides in the fact \nthat they are not organically coherent cultural phe nomena but media collages. Most prior \nhealth movements or fads can be traced back to char ismatic individuals such as e.g. \nSebastian Kneipp 282  and/or relatively influential and homogeneous grou ps, communities or \ninstitutions such as the Monte Verit\u00e0. 283  In contrast, contemporary health ideologies are no t \neven divided churches with many popes but represent  a form of loose ecumenical faith or \nsyncretism that sees no problem with \u2013in fact actua lly encourages\u2013 the recycling of older \ntraditions, the admixture of local and \u201cexotic\u201d kno wledge forms and the aggressive \nmerchandising of wellbeing. This confusion has made  room for a new breed of deskilled-\nreskilled health \u201cengineers\u201d. These individuals or organisations may (but need not \nnecessarily) rely on a professional health backgrou nd to buttress their credibility. What they \ncan rely on, however, is a strong sense of health r ecombinance. When they cannot boast \ngroundbreaking knowledge, they usually claim to hav e found a novel angle on optimal health \nmanagement. This new generation of health engineers  is particularly active in various media \nchannels \u2013whether newspapers, TV or the internet\u2013 w here they have become adept at \nextracting, copy-and-pasting, synthesizing and re-v amping health knowledge and practices. \nBut, as in the entertainment industry, it is often difficult to ascertain authorship as well as to \nenforce a regulatory framework.     \n \nNevertheless, a number of individuals have managed to \u2013sometimes very successfully- \nimpose their signature on a particular \u201cbrand\u201d of h ealth management. A prominent example \non the German-speaking scene is Dr Ulrich Strunz, a  physician cum extreme triathlete, whose \nbestseller \u201cForever Young - the recipe for success: run, eat a nd think your way into youth\u201d  is a \nclever combination of well-known if often controver sial \u201chealthy lifestyle\u201d building blocks, \ninvolving both material and behavioural changes. 284  He particularly emphasises the \n                                                                                                                                                         \nsampling e.g. T.V. news, films, ads or video sequen ces of the dancers performing live during the sessi ons and \noverlaying these samples with fluid chromatic exper iments.

Cf. also his website: http://www.strunz.com . Unfortunately for him, his career \nas a self-proclaimed \u201cfitness-pope\u201d took a tragic t urn in 2006 after a crippling mountain-bike acciden t: cf. e.g. 80 \n \nimportance of eating more fruit and vegetables as w ell as low fat protein, he reminds his \nreaders of the merits of \u201cthe\u201d Mediterranean diet, leads a crusade against the \u201cwrong\u201d and \nfor the \u201cright\u201d fats and sugars, and he recommends appropriate health supplements, regular \njogging and workouts, cardio training, hormonal/blo od monitoring, regenerative sleep, etc. \nThis advice is dished up with a smattering of holis tic tips such as deep breathing and \nrelaxation, smiling, auto-suggestion and positive t hinking, alpha-napping, etc. None of the \nadvice in the book is revolutionary but its success  no doubt lies in the shrewd compilation  of \nvulgarised physiological knowledge and psycho-techn ical quick fixes (along with a colourful \nlayout, an attractively formulaic rhetoric, happy a nd healthy-looking models, not to mention \nthe luscious \u201cfood porn\u201d illustrations). On the oth er hand, many health authors remain \nanonymous as the content-managers of wellness websi tes or the editors of public health \nreports and insurance flyers. 285   \n \nFinally, another parallel can be drawn between reco mbinance in the service industry in \ngeneral and health recombinance. Just as management  knowledge in a flexibilised service \nparadigm, knowledge about health in the medical rea lm has become both extremely \nspecialised and complex. Whilst this knowledge long  contributed to the hegemonic status of \na mechanistic view of health and the body, this sta tus has also become increasingly \ncontested from both within and without the medical establishment \u2013especially linked to the \nreevaluation of social and environmental factors in  the development of so-called civilisation \ndiseases. 286  It has then paved the way for a number of more hol istic theories and practices \nthat posit the necessity of alternative strategies to care for an increasingly unpredictable \nbody. 287  Thus, just as there is no longer one best way to o rganise efficient service production \nbut only a vast array of relatively flexible assemb lages to anticipate or flexibly adapt to \nrapidly changing market conditions, there is no gua ranteed theory or strategy to regain, \npreserve or enhance health. In terms of power struc ture, this situation also implies that \nthere no longer is a central power hub but a variet y of decentralised \u201cpower nodes\u201d that \nhave more or less ideological weight, depending on the following that they can rally. This \nthen leaves more room for personal initiative.  \n \nIn fact, just like \u201cnew economy\u201d employees are requ ired to take initiatives in the \norganisation of flexible production modules, health  consumers are actually required to \ndisplay initiative and discrimination in the choice  of their health gospels \u2013honing the skills to \nextract and splice together information from a grea t variety of sources to meet their \nsubjective health needs. But in both cases, the fra mework is not entirely discretionary: the \nindividual both as neo-liberal employee or health c onsumer is dependent on profit-driven or \ncommodified recombinance. That is, if a certain fle xibility exists in terms of options, there \n                                                                                                                                                         \nhttp://www.ksta.de/html/artikel/1201184441579.shtml  & http://www.drstrunz.de/unfall.html .

This aspect will be further developed in Chapter 4 \n(History ).  \n287  Cf. my short discussion of mechanism vs. (neo-)vit alism in the \u201cTechnology\u201d section as well as Chapte r 4 \n(History ). 81 \n \nnevertheless is an entrepreneurial coercion to take  responsibility or to \u201cperform\u201d, in the \nname of either the company\u2019s or of one\u2019s own health . In fact, the health quandary leads to a \nconflation between the roles of corporate employee and responsible citizen-consumer, as \nneatly summed up by Elisabeth and Ulrich Beck-Gerns heim:   \n \nTo keep one\u2019s head above the water in a competitive  labour market, it is necessary to be fit, \nhealthy and capable. Now health, too, is not so muc h a gift from God as a task and \nachievement of the responsible citizen who must pro tect and look after it or face the \nconsequences. Anyone with health problems has fewer  chances in the labour market and is \nsoon placed in the \u2018hard to find work for\u2019 category . This is a danger that potentially threatens \nall of us. It gives rise to a new morality of healt h, enjoining us to arm ourselves in advance. \n[\u2026] Whereas health used to be something given to us  that only required repairs in an \nemergency, it now has to be constantly produced. 288  \n \nThis individual \u201cmanufacturing of health\u201d imperativ e thus functions at all levels, be it \nproduction, mediation or consumption. In parallel w ith the decentralisation of power \nalluded to above, it also opens the way for a certa in subjectivity in the design of health \nproducts \u2013the marketing and consumption of which no w increasingly involves emotions and \nexperience. This development is enabled by a distin ct shift in goals, away from health viewed \nas a medical-rational achievement to what is seen a s the result or connotation of health, i.e. \npersonal well-being. In this context, individuals a re bound to feel more concerned by an \nappeal to their subjective perception than to a heg emonic health doctrine, couched in \nobscure scientific or technical jargon \u2013a doctrine which as we just noted, no longer exists in a \nunified version. Commodified recombinance therefore  represents a dream tool for the \ninexhaustible marketing and consuming of health and  well-being: not only can products be \nmix\u2019n\u2019matched on a material level but, in the proce ss, experiential and emotional \ndimensions can be spliced into the offer, paving th e way for an almost endless hybridisation \nof healthy lifestyle possibilities.  \nA striking instance of this emotion-splicing proces s is a face cream manufactured by L\u2019Or\u00e9al \ncalled Happyderm 289 . The two main captions on the pack read \u201cExtra moisturising care for \nhappy skin\u201d  and \u201cPhyto-dorphines\u2122 boost the well-being of the skin\u201d .290  Besides more \ngeneral indications on the pack, there are two spec ific blurbs that explain the \u201chappiness\u201d \nconcept as it is understood for this product. The f irst blurb \u2013in question and answer format\u2013 \nasks \u201cWhat is happy skin?\u201d  before replying \u201cHappy skin is sufficiently provided with moisture,  \nsupple and soft. Your complexion is fresh and radia nt. [Your skin] is relaxed and glowing; it \nlooks good, as it does on holiday\u201d .291  The next blurb goes on to detail the significant s cientific \ndiscovery of a skin \u201chappiness molecule\u201d  that imitates the activity of the so-called \u03b2-\nendorphine. Other comments on the product state tha t it makes the skin \u201cglow and bubble \nwith happiness and signs of tiredness and stress di sappear\u201d , its \u201ceuphorising fragrance \nrevives the senses and ensures marvelous well-being \u201d , etc. 292  Significantly, marketing talk \n                                                 \n288  Beck, Ulrich & Beck-Gernsheim, Elisabeth, op. cit. , p. 140. \n289  A face cream manufactured and launched by L\u2019Or\u00e9al in the mid-2000s.  \n290  From the pack in 2006: \u201cExtra Feuchtigkeitspflege f\u00fcr gl\u00fcckliche Haut\u201d ; \u201cPhytodorphine\u2122 boosten das \nWohlgef\u00fchl der Haut\u201d .  \n291  Ibid.: \u201eWas ist gl\u00fcckliche Haut? Gl\u00fcckliche Haut ist ausre ichend mit Feuchtigkeit versorgt, geschmeidig und \nzart. Ihr Teint ist frisch und strahlend. Sie ist e ntspannt und voller Ausstrahlung, sieht gut aus, wi e w\u00e4hrend des \nUrlaubs.\u201c   \n292  Ibid.: \u201eSie strahlt, spr\u00fcht vor Gl\u00fcck und Anzeichnen von M udigkeit un Stress verschwinden [...]\u201c ; \u201eDer \neuphorisierende Duft belebt die Sinne und schenkt h errliches Wohlbefinden\u201c .  82 \n \nhere no longer revolves around environmental aggres sions, wrinkles, etc. as the main tenor \nof cosmetic rhetoric does in the period I have anal ysed. 293  Instead, a rather vague \u201cbusy \nlifestyle\u201d syndrome is the main threat to epidermic  well-being (and is therefore contrasted \nwith a \u201choliday\u201d look). The skin here is no longer perceived as a mere physical shell or \nindicator of age, but as a sensing, living being, c apable of emotion. And even if a certain type \nof scientific vulgarisation has not completely disa ppeared from cosmetic discourse, feelings \nare foregrounded as an essential component of the p roduct experience.   \nNevertheless, product manufacturers and service pro viders must make sure that they \nmaintain a certain distinction or symbolic cohesion  in their boundary-crossing since the ease \nof including emotional or experiential aspects in a n offer may imply that just about anything \ncan trigger emotion or experience \u2013hence a successf ul transaction and potential brand or \nservice loyalty. Actually, most experiential produc ts or services sold do not stand out thanks \nto their technologically (or other) innovative aspe cts. Rather, the clinch resides more in the \nparticular blend between product(s), knowledge and know-how that is on offer, in how this \nblend is symbolically anchored and in what strategi es are employed to market it. In a \ncommodified and recombined paradigm, producers and mediators must work harder at \ncreating new frames of semiotic reference \u2013which ar e continuously negotiated, \nappropriated or rejected by consumers in their ever yday routines. Using the example of the \nbath, Elizabeth Shove convincingly illustrates the complex, multi-factorial causes underlying \nthe semiotic and practical (in the sense of praxis ) transformation of already domesticated \nartefacts: \n \nThe reconfiguration of meaning is evidently importa nt when the transformation of practice is \nnot strongly related to technological development. Somewhat different concepts are \ntherefore required to make sense of situations in w hich already familiar tools and \ninfrastructures are put to different use or in whic h the social significance of practice is \nredefined. During the course of its long career, th e bath has for instance featured as a \nsymbol of social status, an instrument in the war a gainst germs and a site of luxuriating \nrelaxation. The material culture of the bathroom ar guably represents a fluid but none the \nless concrete expression of societal value systems.  Just as the meaning of the artifact has \nbeen rewritten over time, so has the practice and \u2018 purpose\u2019 of bathing. Rationales and \nlegitimizing discourses move in ways that are often  difficult to follow and that frequently \ninvoke complicated chains of scientific, moral and social judgement. Yet these shifting \ncontexts of social and cultural positioning are of immediate consequence for what people do \nand for how they understand and make sense of their  actions. 294  \n \nTo make this phenomenon even more tangible, I will provide another example drawn from \nthe HLT constellation: a brand of tea that was laun ched on the German market in 2002. 295  I \n                                                 \n293  As we shall see in Chapter 6 ( Cosmetics Case-Study ). \n294  Shove, Elizabeth, Comfort,  Cleanliness and Convenience: the social organizatio n of normality , Oxford & New \nYork: Berg, 2003, p.16. \n295  The company no longer quotes when the tea was intr oduced in its timeline: \nhttp://www.messmer.de/de/markenwelt/markengeschicht e/index.html  \u2013which was the case, when I \npreviously accessed their website in March 2006\u2013 bu t its launch can be reconstrued by looking at consu mer \ntest reports, as found here (it is also very enligh tening to witness the broad range of conclusions dr awn \u2013from \nenthusiastic to deprecating): \nhttp://www.ciao.de/Erfahrungsberichte/Mesmer_Ananda _Tee_Ginseng_Lychee__1060670 . Otherwise, similar \nconclusions can be reached for a number of other HL Ts \u2013such as the shower gel and the bath salts quote d at \nthe very beginning of Chapter 1 ( Introduction ). I have also provided many examples in various co nference \npapers over the past years. [websites accessed Aug.  2011] 83 \n \nhave chosen tea because a priori it is not a partic ularly revolutionary product and this \nparticular brand is readily available in a number o f local supermarkets. It therefore fittingly \nillustrates the kind of semiotic work necessary to style normalised or long-domesticated \nproducts into HLTs. Messmer\u2019s Ananda Tee Ginseng-Lychee  is part of a so-called Ayurveda \nassortment \u2013featuring two other varieties, and this  particular one is labelled \u201cbalancing-\nexotic\u201d .296  The caption on the pack reads as follows: \u201cIn Asian traditions, Ananda represents \nbliss. For centuries in India, meditation and a bal anced diet have paved the way towards this \nideal state. Messmer Ananda Tea combines Ginseng an d Lychee, making it into a balancing \nexotic blend. This tea enables you to counter stres s in a perfectly natural way.\u201d 297   \n \nFirst of all, it should be noted that technoscienti fic authority or rationales no longer seem to \nhold the upper hand. Instead, this type of product often appeals to historical, natural or \nmystical/supernatural dimensions, which may or may not be geographically contextualised. \nWhen they are, the geographical hence cultural cont extualisation is often very fuzzy \u2013to say \nthe least\u2013 and the connection between ingredients a nd their origins are usually very weak or \nsometimes even inaccurate. This example is a case i n point: Ananda is supposedly anchored \nin a mystical Indian context and lifestyle, 298  but ginseng as well as its medicinal use originate  \nin China and Korea 299  and the lychee fruit was originally native to sout h China 300  \u2013facts that \nseems to be confirmed by the green and white Tao si gn that is used to decorate the package. \nProducers thus freely weave heterogeneous \u201cexotic-A sian\u201d elements into a mythical-\nmystical canvas to support the declared effect of t he tea. 301  References are so curt as to \nfunction like a \u201ctoken\u201d or \u201cpedigree\u201d: here, nature , mysticism or tradition represent \nstandardised references that do not require further  explanations.   \n \nThe second aspect is that specific ingredients are highlighted that are not the essential \ncomponent of the product, i.e. we only find out abo ut the variety of tea used by examining \n                                                 \n296  \u201eausgleichend-exotisch\u201c , from the 2002 package.  \n297  Ibid.: \u201cAnanda steht in der asiatischen \u00dcberlieferung f\u00fcr die Gl\u00fcckseligkeit.

She concludes that the vanishing point of  oriental and exotic appropriation in \nthe field of wellness is \u201cder Machtanspruch, sich Zeichen des \u201cAnderen\u201d  einzuverleiben (p. 55).  84 \n \nthe small print under the Ingredients heading: \u201c green tea (60%), blackberry leaves, orange \nrind, plum fruit granules, flavouring (lychee), cho keberries, gingko leaves, ginseng root (2%), \nchrysanthemum leaves.\u201d 302  The list thus shows to what extent the material co mposition of \nthe product mirrors the symbolic recombinance in th e product description. Indeed it further \nblurs concrete and mythical-mystical geographical b oundaries: green tea (presumably from \nAsia or maybe Africa) as well as leaves and fruit f rom a number of European, North American \nand South East Asian shrubs and trees are blended t ogether into a globalising \u201cwell-being\u201d \nelixir. Significantly the referenced \u201clychee\u201d ingre dient turns out be just a flavouring! So much \nfor the \u201cperfectly natural way\u201d  to combat stress\u2026 \n \nFinally it should be stressed that no clear technic al or physiological explanations are \nprovided for the ingredients that are highlighted: vague adjectives, such as \u201cbalancing\u201d or \n\u201cenergizing\u201d, are just dropped. It is up to the con sumer to provide the missing links between \nan ingredient and its potential physical and/or psy cho-mystical effects, such as aura-\nenhancement, pleasure or harmony. Specific \u201chealth- inducing\u201d ingredients such as e.g. \n\u201cginseng\u201d in this case, or e.g. \u201caloe vera\u201d are dro pped as buzz-words in the description of \nmany HLTs. The former is often made to represent th e epitome of eastern longevity while \nthe latter is implicitly recognised as a post-indus trial panacea, providing anything from \nmoisturising to detoxicating features. One could th us appeal to \u201cBarthesian\u201d terminology \nand say that signifiers such as \u201cginseng\u201d or \u201caloe vera\u201d no longer directly point to denotative \nsignifieds \u2013the plants themselves or their biochemi cal properties\u2013 but to connotative \nsignifieds such as health, balance, purity, etc. 303    \nIn sum, the referential web surrounding HLTs is inc reasingly broad: the semiotics of these \nnew foodstuffs and cosmetics is often set free from  concrete physiological and technical \ncharacteristics to include associations with lifest yle, recreation, meditation and even a form \nof spiritual enlightenment. Moreover, technology is  naturalised through the dilation of \nconnotation strategies: it frequently merges with t radition, belief, instinct and intuition, thus \ncontributing to a new health myth in the Barthesian  sense.304  In fact, product discourse \ngenerally moves very swiftly from the factual (type  of ingredients) to the functional (effect \non the body) 305  to dwell at length on the sensual and experiential  \u2013in a transcendental curve. \nBasic human activities such as eating and drinking become holistic \u201cexperiential\u201d gateways \nto the consumer\u2019s psyche, overshadowing the physiol ogical and technological trajectories of \nthese processes. Ultimately, consumer subjectivity is the ingredient that makes the product \n                                                 \n302  Cf. 2002 package. \n303  Cf. e.g. Chandler, Daniel, Semiotics for Beginners: Glossary of Key-Terms , online: \nhttp://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem-gloss .html#D : \u201cDenotation: The term refers to the \nrelationship between the signifier and its signifie d. Denotation is routinely treated as the definitional, 'literal' , \n'obvious' or 'commonsense' meaning of a sign, but s emioticians tend to treat it as a signified about w hich there \nis a relatively broad  consensus . For Barthes, a denotative sign existed within wha t he called the  first  order of \nsignification. In this framework connotation is a f urther sign (or signs) deriving from the signifier of a denotative \nsign. However, no clear distinction can be made bet ween denotation and  connotation.\u201d  Cf. also the already \nquoted Chandler, Daniel, Semiotics for Beginners: Denotation, Connotation an d Myth , online: \nhttp://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem06.htm l . There Chandler provides a good analysis of \nBarthes\u2019 theoretical evolution regarding denotation , connotation and myth and their subsequent blurrin g from \na post-structuralist angle. Here, however, to simpl ify the argument, I retain a more structuralist def inition. \n[website accessed Aug. 2011] \n304  Cf. Barthes, Roland, op. cit. \n305  This step is however often extremely foreshortened  or even omitted. 85 \n \ncome alive, which is why producers must enrol consu mers\u2019 endorsement in the shape of \nbeliefs or at least a suspension of disbelief. As G erhard Schulze expresses it:  \n \nEconomically seen, it represents a total reversal f rom the traditional rationality of the user. If \nit was rational in the object-centred economy to mi strust the quality assurances of the \nproducer and to only consider an artefact as worthy  of being bought after a carefully critical \nappraisal, the contrary is now valid in the subject -oriented economy: it is rational to believe  \nthe effectiveness promises of the producer, because  one thereby increases the likelihood \nthat the promised effect will set in. 306  \n \nHence the experiential dimension of consumption can  be seen as the latest adjunct in \npotential consumption incentives. However, this dim ension does not negate or necessarily \ncontradict previous incentives. Rather it builds on  or even transcends the rationales put \nforth by economists (material needs, functional rat ionality, maximisation of utility), \nanthropologists, ethnologists and sociologists (soc ial distinction and identity needs or wants) \nas well as literary theorists (consumption as a/n \u2013 often non verbal- communicative \nfunction). 307  What the experiential priority does is to reinstat e a holistic body subjectivity \u2013\nthat is at once sensuous, pleasure-seeking and open  to novelty\u2013 as a central motor of \nconsumption. Consumers can thus be seen as constructivist users  who choose from a \nnumber of subjective realities in an experience eco nomy. Their health or well-being choices \nmake them into the co-producers of HLTs, since the experience of a technology is in evitably \nmediated by individually embodied subjectivities. \n \nJoy Annamma and Venkatesh Alladi neatly encapsulate  the challenges linked to this \ntransition by meditating on the origins and limitat ions of the \u201chomo economicus\u201d concept \nand how it is being transcended: \n \nThe Cartesian dualism of mind/body distinctions als o gave rise to other metaphors of the \nbody that privileged the mind over the body, such a s \u201chomoeconomicus\u201d. The use of such a \nmetaphor creates a particular textual reality which  appears to be fixed. Homoeconomicus \nforces us to think of human consumption behaviour a s primarily economic in character and \neliminates consideration of other aspects of consum ption, such as hedonism or symbolism. \n[\u2026] The use of such a metaphor based on rationality  brings to prominence the mind-body \ndualism that privileges the mind and cognitive acti vity over the body and emotional or \nphysical labor. As Hirschmann observes, from a marx ist and/or feminist  perspective, such \nideology is distorted and incomplete, because it ex cludes all other forms of social behavior \nother than contractual relationships. The rational economic model of consumption has now \ngiven way to more affective modes of consumption [. ..]. 308   \n \n                                                 \n306  Schulze, Gerhard, \u201cZeit der Wunder: auch der neue Modetrend Wellness ist Teil des Erlebnismarktes\u201d, Die \nZeit , 41, 1999, online version: http://www.zeit.de/1999/41/199941.kur.erlebnis_.xml : \u201e\u00d6konomisch gesehen, \ngilt hier eine v\u00f6llige Umkehr der traditionellen Ra tionalit\u00e4t des Verbrauchers.

Bingle, Gwen & Weber,  Heike, \nop. cit., especially section 2.1. \n308  Anamma, Joy & Alladi, Venkatesh, op. cit., p. 335.   86 \n \nIn this section, I hope to have shown the extent to  which emotional and experiential \ncommodification seem to be taking the lead over mor e straightforwardly economic \ncommodification strategies. I also hope that the us e and dicussion of the \u201crecombinance\u201d \nmetaphor has shed light on the elaboration of new t ypes of contructed rationalities drawing \nupon a variety of codes. Closely linked to the find ings of this section, the next section \nattempts to briefly outline a shift in the history of the mind-body relationship \u2013a shift that \nhas greatly contributed to the emergence of emotion al and experiential commodification, by \ncalling attention to and legitimising the body as a  valid source of cognition and \nconsciousness.  \n \nEmbodied consciousness \n \nNotre corps en tant qu\u2019il se meut lui-m\u00eame, c\u2019est-\u00e0 -dire en tant qu\u2019il est ins\u00e9parable d\u2019une vue \ndu monde et qu\u2019il est cette vue m\u00eame r\u00e9alis\u00e9e, est la condition de possibilit\u00e9, non seulement \nde la synth\u00e8se g\u00e9om\u00e9trique, mais encore de toutes l es op\u00e9rations expressives et de toutes les \nacquisitions qui constituent le monde culturel.  309   \n \nEtre une conscience ou plut\u00f4t \u00eatre une exp\u00e9rience , c\u2019est communiquer int\u00e9rieurement avec le \nmonde, le corps et les autres, \u00eatre avec eux au lie u d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 d\u2019eux. 310   \n \nI wonder what Maurice Merleau Ponty would have said , had he been confronted with the \nlatest generation of \u201cexperiential\u201d wellness produc ts\u2026 In my initial Introduction , I \nprovocatively asked what had happened to German con sumers: whether they had forsaken \ndiscriminating \u201cProtestant\u201d rationality for a softl y passive \u201cBuddhist\u201d path or had simply \nbecome the bewildered victims of crafty marketing g urus. 311  The irony of the question was \nprovoked by two strange captions found on wellness bathing products described as bridges \ntowards \u201ca holistic wellness experience for body, mind and soul\u201d  and \u201can aura of tranquillity \nand peace\u201d .312  Despite the irony, the question remained puzzling until I tackled the \n\u201cCommodification\u201d section. There, we saw that the c ontinued encroachment of \ncommodification on all aspects of everyday life req uired the annexation of experience and \nits prime medium, the body. The analysis of this ne w experiential ethos dominated by \ntranscultural recombinance demonstrated that \u201cProte stant\u201d rationality and \u201cBuddhist\u201d paths \nneed not contradict each other: sovereign consumers  can appeal to scientific rationality \nwhile at the same time consciously deciding to be s educed by much more fuzzy esoteric \nconcepts. 313   \n \nMy aim in this section is therefore to look beyond the latest commodification turn to see \nwhat kind of cultural hinterland has actually enabl ed and legitimated a shift in the \nperception of the body and its experiential primacy . Indeed, I contend that the proliferation \nof holistically designed HLTs owes as much, if not more, to shifting paradigms in the sciences \n                                                 \n309  Merleau-Ponty, Maurice, Ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nologie de la perception , Paris: Gallimard, 1945, p. 445:  \u201cOur body, in the \nsense that it is self-moving, hence that it is inse parable from a worldview and is itself the realisat ion of this \nview, is the condition for the possibility not only  of geometric synthesis but also of all expressive operations and \nall the acquisitions that constitute the cultural w orld.\u201d   \n310  Ibid. p. 113: \u201c Being a conscience or rather being an experience  is communicating internally with the world, \nthe body and others, being with them instead of bes ide them.\u201d  [emphasis in original] \n311  Cf.

There fore, the following discussion will take us \nalong the path from Cartesianism to cognitive scien ce(s), through phenomenology, \npsychophysiology and integrative medicine \u2013within a  reflexively modern context. Its aim is to \ndisplay the theoretical underpinnings that have fos tered a re-focusing on bodily, sensuous \nexperience as constitutive \u2013or rather a pre-conditi on\u2013 of a satisfying sense of selfhood, \nhence personal agency. Both \u201cUnder the sign of the body\u201d and \u201cTechnology\u201d have already \nset the stage for this discussion. In the former se ction, I hinted at the tension in the arts \nbetween the body perceived as sign and the body per ceived as \u201ccorps v\u00e9cu\u201d, and, in \nparticular how it threatened to undermine the entir e historical enterprise (i.e. through the \nindividual situatedness hence ambivalence of histor ical discourse and the difficulty of \ngrasping even unreliable signs of past \u201ccorps v\u00e9cus \u201d). And in the latter section, I showed that \ntechnology experientially merged with the body, thu s blurring the boundaries between \nculture and nature but also between subject and obj ect. These findings thus questioned the \nmodernist project and its hard and fast dichotomies . 314  Therefore, the last modernist \ndichotomy that I would like to tackle here is the m ind (soul)-body divide, a divide which the \ndiscourse on and around HLTs repeatedly attempts to  bridge, as in the two bathing examples \nI initially provided.    \n \nBeside the seminal influence of Christianity, Stefa n Haas briefly sums up the currents that \nhave proved the most influential on the cultivation  of the body-mind tension:  \n \nThis dichotomy can already be detected in Classical  Antiquity. But it is Cartesianism which \ntransformed this antagonism into the entirety of se cular reality and thus radically modified \nthe problem, since there is no superior saving prin ciple left in the earthly dimension. Kant \ndescribed the two worlds of which man partakes in t hat sense: through his embodiment, he \nis part of nature, but because of his faculty for p ure reasoning, he belongs to the moral \nworld. On the grounds of his  intelligibility, man can thus rise above his embodi ment and \nenslave himself to a self-chosen morality. 315  \n \nThus, Cartesianism should not be perceived as a cau se (as is often put forward) but rather as \na consequence of a divide crystallised earlier \u2013the  momentum of which can be seen as \nrecurring cyclically in the course of Classical Ant iquity and the history of Christianity, \nespecially Protestantism:  \n \n                                                 \n314  Cf. Ferguson, Harvie, op. cit.,  p. 5: \u201cAs a general characterization of reality, the Obje ct/Subject relation is \nspecific to Modernity; it is its self-definition an d its modality of existence. This distinction is re plicated over and \nover again in the specific practices that mark Mode rnity as a distinctive way of life: mind and body; use and \nexchange; appearance and reality, all more or less directly encode the distinction between Subject and  Object. \nIndeed, we might well be tempted to define Modernit y as a worldview and a related set of social practi ces for \nwhich the distinction between object and subject is  fundamental, as compared to the premodern or the \nnonmodern, which might be conceived as a worldview and related social practices for which such a disti nction \nhas little or no significance.\u201d \n315  Haas, Stefan, \u201eVom Ende des K\u00f6rpers in den Datenne tzen. Dekonstruktion eines postmodernen Mythos\u201c, \nK\u00f6rper mit Geschichte: Der Menschliche K\u00f6rper als O rt der Selbst- und Weltdeutung , op. cit., p. 99: \u201eDiese \nDichotomie von K\u00f6rper und Geist l\u00e4sst sich bereits in der Antike nachweisen. Aber erst der Cartesianis mus \nmacht aus dem Gegensatz die Gesamtheit der diesseit igen Wirklichkeit und modifiziert damit das Problem  \nradikal, indem es kein aufhebendes, \u00fcbergeordnetes weltliches Prinzip mehr gibt. In diesem Sinn beschr ieb Kant \nzwei Welten, in denen der Mensch lebe: vermittels s einer Leiblichkeit ist er Teil der Natur, durch sei ne F\u00e4higkeit \nzur reinen Vernunft geh\u00f6rt er zur moralischen Welt.  Der Mensch kann sich dabei aufgrund seiner Intelli gibilit\u00e4t \n\u00fcber seine Leiblichkeit stellen und sie der selbstg ew\u00e4hlten Sittlichkeit unterwerfen.\u201c  88 \n \n[\u2026] it is because reflection in our culture has bee n severed from its bodily life that the mind-\nbody problem has become a central topic for abstrac t reflection. Cartesian dualism is not so \nmuch one competing solution as it is the formulatio n of this problem. Reflection is taken to \nbe distinctly mental, and so the problem arises of how it could ever be linked to bodily life. 316    \n \nHowever, even if this Cartesian-Kantian framing dom inated the philosophical scene for so \nlong, a more discreet tradition managed to maintain  itself in parallel, \u201c[\u2026] a minor branch of \n\u2018philosophy\u2019 (materialism, ideology critique) or at  most a philosophy diverted toward politics, \neconomics, psychology: Helv\u00e9tius, Diderot, d\u2019Holbac h, La Mettrie, and ultimately even Marx, \nnot to mention the Nietzsche who devoured the id\u00e9ol ogues.\u201d 317  And it sought inspiration \nfrom Spinoza to Condillac\u2019s Trait\u00e9 des Sensations  [1754] \u201cfor whom no impression of the \nworld, could be born disembodied , because only the body could feel : \u2018penser et sentir sont la \nm\u00eame chose\u2019.\u201d 318  But it was only in the 20 th  century, once new ground had been broken by \nphysics, that a phenomenological approach to embodi ment truly gained scientific credibility \nwith Maurice Merleau-Ponty, via Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. Indeed, it is mainly \nthe former\u2019s contribution that paved the philosophi cal path that would inspire a more \ncohesive transdisciplinary development of the so-ca lled cognitive sciences (including \nneuroscience, cognitive psychology, linguistics, ar tificial intelligence and their association \nwith phenomenological schools of thought) expanding  and cross-breeding disciplines such as \nneurology, psychoanalysis and behaviourist experime ntal psychology, which until then had \nevolved in relative isolation. 319  \n \nMerleau-Ponty was particularly seminal because he \u201cproposed that analysis begin with the \npreobjective act of perception rather than with alr eady constituted objects. He recognized \nthat perception was always embedded in a cultural w orld, such that the preobjective in no \nway implies a \u201cpre-cultural\u201d. At the same time, he acknowledged that his own work did not \nelaborate the steps between perception and explicit  cultural and historical analysis. \u201d320  \nHowever, what he did develop was a convincing descr iption of the two poles of \nembodiment: \u201cit encompasses both the body as a lived, experient ial structure and the body \nas the context or milieu of cognitive mechanisms.\u201d 321  My introductory quote thus \nconvincingly illustrates these two aspects. Merleau -Ponty envisions the body as autokinetic, \na characteristic that generates the autopoietic pro cess of experience: the body\u2019s movement \ninto the world generates sensuous data that contrib utes to a worldview that is both literal \nand metaphorical, without which consciousness, henc e culture, is virtually unthinkable. But \nit is situated interaction or exchange with the wor ld, the body and others that enables \nsubjective experience \u2013in sum, the constitution of a sense of selfhood. This position then \nseems to suggest that the presence of culture anted ates the experience of the subject in the \nworld or at least emerges concurrently \u201cbecause it cannot be consciousness without playing  \nupon significances given either in the absolute pas t of nature or in its own personal past, and \n                                                 \n316  Varela, Francisco J., Thompson, Evan & Rosch, Elea nor, The Embodied Mind: Cognitive and Human \nExperience .

Indeed, this  first step does not require finding out if the \n(natural or cultural) world actually does exist out side of an individual perspective (hence \npotentially has a history) or establishing a diachr onically unfolding sense of self, or even \nascertaining the generality of experience \u2013all of w hich can be postponed to a subsequent \nphase. What is central here is that \u201c[w]hen the body is recognized for what it is in \nexperiential terms, not as an object but as a subje ct, the mind-body distinction becomes \nmuch more uncertain.\u201d 324  In an increasingly secularised and disenchanted 20th  century, it \nmeant that the Cartesian \u201cin the beginning there wa s Reason\u201d \u2013which had replaced the \ntheistic \u201cin the beginning there was God\u201d\u2013 was grad ually replaced by \u201cin the beginning there \nwas the Body\u201d. This substitution did not necessaril y seal or signify the death of God or of \nReason, but what it did do is subordinate the exper ience of these dimensions to the \n\u201csubjectivity\u201d of the body. It also paved the way f or more holistic, Eastern or \u201caboriginal\u201d \nphilosophical and mystical traditions to gain a foo thold in Western thought \u2013traditions which \ninstead of banning the body outside the spheres of knowledge and spirituality have long \nused it as a bridge to explore or deconstruct these  spheres. I am thinking here of a number \nof Hindu and Buddhist schools of thought not to men tion Turkish Sufism, as well as many \nshamanic teachings and practices. 325   \n \nThis body slant represented nothing short of a para digm revolution in both the \u201cnatural\u201d and \nthe \u201chuman\u201d sciences. In historical-philosophical t erms, it might have appeared like a step \nback into a pre-Cartesian worldview (or the mainstr eaming of a marginal current) but it took \nplace in a world that had drawn and still draws hug e \u201cadvantages\u201d from the Cartesian \n                                                 \n322  Merleau-Ponty, Maurice, Phenomenology of Perception , London & New York: Routledge 1962 [originally \npublished in French in 1945], p. 158.

Sonu Shamdasani, Olten: Walter, 1998. 90 \n \ndichotomies of mind vs. body, object vs. subject, c ulture vs. nature, etc. Indeed, these \ndichotomies not only enabled, they legitimized \u201cobj ective\u201d scientific research and \ntechnological development as hegemonic practices. H ence, the change of paradigm towards \nthe primacy of the body meant (and still means!) no thing less than footnoting every \nexperiment, every analysis, every result, every mod el or theory with an asterisk conveying \nthe sense of a bodily bias, of the messy convergenc e of subject and object, mind and body, \nculture and nature \u2013the clear boundaries of which a re now irretrievably lost. In sum, this \nshift confronted and still confronts all and every form of knowledge to its in-corporated  \nsituatedness or relativity. Shaun Gallagher radical ly contends that:   \n \n[\u2026] nothing about human experience remains untouche d by human embodiment: from the \nbasic perceptual and emotional processes that are a lready at work in infancy, to a \nsophisticated interaction with other people; from t he acquisition and creative use of \nlanguage, to higher cognitive faculties involving j udgment and metaphor; from the exercise \nof free will in intentional action, to the creation  of cultural artefacts that provide for further \nhuman affordances. 326   \n \nBut, even before embodiment flavours human experien ce in a wider cultural realm, its own \n\u201cinner\u201d articulation may prove problematic. Gallagh er, a philosopher specialised in \nphenomenology and cognitive science, discusses a se ries of troubling case-studies on \nneonate imitation, phantoms in the case of congenit al absence of limbs, unilateral neglect, \nthe loss of proprioception (registration of own sel f-movement) and the tactile sense, \nschizophrenic manifestations, etc. 327  All these studies seem to point towards the fact t hat \nembodiment crucially conditions the sense of selfho od (and its boundaries), indeed that \nselfhood is first and foremost embodied. 328  They also confirm the validity of articulating \nembodiment into two distinct determinants \u2013body ima ge, that \u201cconsists of a system of \nperceptions, attitudes, and beliefs pertaining to o ne\u2019s own body\u201d  and body schema, \u201ca \nsystem of sensory-motor capacities that function wi thout awareness or the necessity of \nperceptual monitoring\u201d 329 \u2013 since in the cases examined, one witnesses either a  co-operation \nor a dissociation of these determinants.   \n \nFor example, the loss of proprioception, which affe cts the optimal functioning of the body \nschema, means that the individual has to consciousl y control muscles and focus her/his \nattention to accomplish even the most mundane tasks , such as to pick up a glass and drink \nfrom it. 330  The body image function thus has to compensate for  an ailing body schema \n                                                 \n326  Gallagher, Shaun, How the Body Shapes the Mind , Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2005, p. 248. \n327  Thus building on the pioneer work of Merleau-Ponty  but also on that of a number of cognitive scientis ts \nsuch as the neurologist Oliver Sacks, whose brillia nt vulgarisations of neurological malfunctions (dra wn from \npatient histories) were probably the first to highl ight the ground-breaking importance of cognitive sc ience for a \nbroader public, cf. especially:  Sacks, Oliver, The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat , New York: Simon & \nSchuster, 1998 [first published in 1985]. \n328  Gallagher, Shaun, op. cit, p. 3: \u201cThe human body, and the way it structures human ex perience, also shapes \nthe human experience of self, and perhaps the very possibility of developing a sense of self. If the s elf is \nanything more than this, it is nonetheless and firs t of all this, an embodied self.\u201d  \n329  Ibid., p. 24 \n330  Ibid., p. 26: \u201cMovements controlled by a body schema can be preci sely shaped by the intentional experience \nor goal-directed behaviour of the subject. If I rea ch for a glass of water with the intention of drink ing from it, my \nhand, completely outside my awareness, shapes itsel f in a precise way for picking up the glass. It tak es on a \ncertain form in conformity with my intention. It is  important to note that although a body schema is n ot itself a 91 \n \nfunction. In a \u201chealthy\u201d subject, these two dimensi ons continuously and seamlessly \ncomplement and feed into each other and it is usual ly only in the case of a (temporary) \ndisturbance in one or the other realm that the arti culation becomes obvious to individuals, \nor at least their environment. Indeed, the body ima ge 331  consciously and unconsciously \ninfluences the body schema 332  just as disturbances in the body schema more or le ss \nconsciously constrain body image. 333  Thus, even if this articulation is redolent of a s ubject-\nobject dyad, within lived experience it can be deco nstructed as a single co-dependent \nprocess. And while bodily awareness is often fragme nted and fluctuates greatly in the course \nof experience, it is always close to the surface of  human experience, since perception is \nusually a \u201cplenary gestalt\u201d , involving and \u201cstructured by all the senses\u201d .334  Gallagher thus \npointedly reframes the question of embodied conscio usness:  \n \nTo ask about the prenoetic effects of embodiment is  to ask about what happens behind the \nscenes of consciousness, and about how the body ant icipates and sets the stage for \nconsciousness. More precisely, the question in this  case is not about the apparent structure  \nof consciousness, but about the structuring  of consciousness, and the role that embodiment \nplays in the structuring process. How does the fact  of embodiment, the fact that \nconsciousness is embodied, affect , and perhaps effect , intentional experience? 335  \n \nThis is a question that cognitive science is only b eginning to tackle, with the help of the case-\nstudies mentioned above. It is also a question that  more practically-oriented scientists are \ntrying to broach, albeit from another angle, that o f decision-making, especially as it relates \nto neuromarketing. In the U.S., the technical oppor tunities offered by fMRI [functional \nmagnetic resonance imaging] seem to allow for a con vergence of research at a number of \ninstitutions such as Princeton, Caltech or the Brig ht House Institute for Thought Sciences in \nAtlanta. fMRI technology has enabled researchers fr om these very diverse institutions to \nvisualise what areas of the brain are stimulated by  certain socio-economic experiments, be it \nbrand identification, the relation between rational  and emotional investment in a product, \nthe readiness to invest according to trust or to sp end money for a very special gratification, \n                                                                                                                                                         \nform of consciousness, or in any way a cognitive op eration, it can enter into and support (or in some cases \nundermine) intentional activity, including cognitio n.\u201d \n331  Together with other researchers, Gallagher adopts a subdivision of body image into three components : \u201c1. \nBody percept: the subject\u2019s perceptual experience o f his/her own body. 2. Body concept: the subject\u2019s \nconceptual understanding (including folk and/or sci entific knowledge) of the body in general; and 3. B ody \naffect: the subject\u2019s emotional attitude toward his /her own body. Although (2) and (3) do not necessar ily \ninvolve an occurrent conscious awareness, they are maintained as sets of beliefs, attitudes, or dispos itions, and \nin that sense form part of an intentional system.\u201d , Ibid., p. 25.  \n332  E.g. if over a long period, I am convinced that my  body is huge, consciously ample \u201cnavigation\u201d movem ents \nmay become inscribed in my body schema and I will t hereafter automatically and unconsciously avoid \nconstricted spaces. \n333  E.g. a heart attack or a partial neural paralysis will no doubt contribute to my perceiving, monitori ng and \ncaring for my body in a different way. \n334  Cf. Ihde, Don, op. cit., p. 38: \u201cIn actual experience there is a constancy of what I call whole-body perception, \nin the sense that our perceptions occur as a plenar y gestalt in relation to an experienced environment . We \ninteract with the world around us. It is also the c laim here that our whole-body perceptions are senso rily \nsynthesized in our interactions with a \u201cworld\u201d. Unl ike the older traditions of discrete and separable sense, \nphenomenology holds that I never have a simple or i solated visual experience. My experience of some ob ject \nthat is seen is simultaneously and constantly also an experience that is structured by all the senses. \u201d  \n335  Gallagher, Shaun, op. cit, p. 2.   92 \n \netc. 336  The design of all these experiments rests on the f act that, according to the stimulation \nprovided, fMRI tracks brain function indirectly, by  measuring blood flow (which signifies that \nneurons have just been fired in specific areas of t he brain). Results until now seem to point \nto the fact that neither \u201cpure reason\u201d nor \u201cpure em otion\u201d dominate economic choices but \nthat many other fuzzier, experiential aspects facto r into decision making, such as \nidentification potential, trust, etc.  \n \nPerhaps the most disconcerting experiment was a sci entific remake by Read Montague at \nthe Baylor College of Medicine of the Coke-Pepsi  challenges featured in commercials aired in \nthe 1970s and 80s. 337  The findings were particularly striking: when test  subjects were blind \ntested, Pepsi came out the distinct favourite (corr elated by heightened activity in the so-\ncalled ventral putamen, the reward centre of the br ain) but when, at the outset, subjects \nwere told which samples were Coke and which Pepsi, Coke came out first and the brain \nactivity of subjects actually changed. The area the n highlighted was that of the medial \nprefrontal cortex, an area of the brain that govern s high-level cognitive activity and also \u2013\nsome scientists posit\u2013 the area associated with a s ense of self, hence identification. 338  \nTherefore, the brand and its associations seemed to  override the pure reward sensation.  \n \nEven if this discovery still cannot be labelled as the discovery of the long sought after \u201cbuy-\nbutton\u201d in the brain, it nevertheless has important  implications not only for neuromarketing, \nbut for cognitive science in general and phenomenol ogical preoccupations in particular. \nIndeed, this is where intersubjectivity or culture comes back into the picture \u2013even if one \ncould argue that the design of the second part of t he experiment may have in fact just \nelicited a conditioned brand identification reflex,  not so distant from its simpler Pavlovian \ncousin. Nevertheless, the point is that human exper ience never happens in a vacuum (even \nwhen enacted within an experimental space). In fact , the distinction delineated above \nbetween schema and image (in terms of body percepti on) can be revived here: Pepsi \nseemed to appeal to the \u201cschema\u201d aspect of percepti on \u2013in a sense the sensory-motor \npreference\u2013 whereas Coke seemed to engage more stro ngly with the \u201cimage\u201d understanding \n(reflecting an extant system  of perceptions, attitudes and beliefs). Consciousn ess \u2013or \nmeaning-building\u2013 thus seems to be rooted in the bo dy but constantly negotiated and  \n\u201cexperienced within a domain of consensual action a nd cultural history\u201d . 339  In the words of \nMark Johnson:  \n \nMeaning includes patterns of embodied experience an d pre-conceptual structures of our \nsensibility (i.e., our mode of perception, or orien ting ourselves, and of interacting with other \nobjects, events, or persons). These embodied patter ns do not remain private or peculiar to \nthe person who experiences them.

They become shared cultural modes of  experience and help to determine the \nnature of our meaningful, coherent understanding of  our \u201cworld\u201d. 340   \n \nWhat this implies for cognitive research is that \u201cworld and perceiver specify each other\u201d .341  \nThus, the interesting twist that phenomenology brin gs to the study of HLTs is that the latter \nreunite at least two perceptive modes because they are geared towards the experiencing of \none\u2019s own body but within a collective body paradig m. Thomas Csordas sheds an interesting \nlight on this phenomenon with his concept of \u201csomatic modes of attention\u201d . Based on \nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s insight whereby objects are constit uted out of an indeterminate horizon by \nour perceptive attention, he explores the moment wh en the perceiver actually focuses on \nher/his own body, the moment when the body becomes at once subject and object:  \n \nSomatic modes of attention are culturally elaborate d ways of attending to and with one\u2019s \nbody in surroundings that include the embodied pres ence of others. Because attention \nimplies both sensory engagement and an object, we m ust emphasize that our working \ndefinition refers both to attending \u201cwith\u201d and atte nding \u201cto\u201d the body. To a certain extent it \nmust  be both. To attend to a bodily sensation is not to  attend to the body as an isolated \nobject, but to attend to the body\u2019s situation in th e world. The sensation engages something \nin the world because the body is \u201calways already in  the world\u201d. Attention to  a bodily \nsensation can thus become a mode of attending to th e intersubjective milieu that gives rise \nto that sensation. 342   \n \nWhile Csordas undertakes an anthropological analysi s of charismatic Christian and Navajo \nhealing that involves the embodied presence of othe rs, his analysis remains valid for the \nappropriation of HLTs, which is often a private act . It remains valid because, by buying (into) \nHLTs, consumers inscribe their bodies into a forest ructured experiential realm. Indeed, the \ngeneric design of HLTs presupposes a common \u201cembodi edness\u201d that can then (potentially) \nbe assimilated into a subjective realm. HLTs thus r epresent a novel \u201csomatic mode of \nattention\u201d , embedded in a conscious cultural process that pos its the body\u2019s need for positive \nexperiential and healthful attention: \n \n[\u2026] the ways we attend to and with our bodies, and even the possibility of attending, are \nneither arbitrary nor biologically determined, but are culturally constituted. Leenhardt\u2019s \n(1979) classic study of the Canaques of New Caledon ia described not only a way of \nconceptualizing the body radically distinct from ou r own, but the exclusion of the body per se \nas an object of consciousness until the people were  introduced by missionaries to the \nobjectified body of Christian culture. This suggest s that neither attending to nor attending \nwith the body can be taken for granted, but must be  formulated as culturally constituted \nsomatic modes of attention. 343   \n \nThe Canaque example immediately brings to mind the fact that perhaps the most \nemblematic and widespread somatic mode of attention  in the West has for centuries been \nmedicine and the various ways in which it has objec tified the body across traditions. The \nadvent of so-called conventional medicine or modern  Western \u201cscientific\u201d medicine in the \ncourse of the 19 th  century \u2013linked to the impacts of modern physiolog y and bacteriology\u2013 \n                                                 \n340  Johnson, Mark, The Body in the Mind: the bodily basis of imaginati on, reason and meaning , Chicago: \nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1987, p. 175.  \n341  Varela, Francisco J. & al., op. cit., p. 172. \n342  Csordas, Thomas J., op. cit., p. 245. \n343  Ibid., p. 246.   94 \n \nhas especially crystallised this perspective. Where as the Classical paradigm (i.e. the \nHippocratic and Galenic traditions) already separat ed the body into soul and mind \ncomponents, it still paid attention to the individu al person, her/his global \u201cecological \nphysiology\u201d and a dynamic \u201cnatural\u201d equilibrium. In  contrast, conventional medicine puts \nmore emphasis on a \u201cuniversal\u201d body potentially red ucible to physics and chemistry, i.e. a \nparticular physiological model that distinguishes t he normal  from the diseased or deviant. 344   \n \nVolker Rittner neatly retraces the success of this so-called somatic model  (starting in the 19 th  \ncentury), emphasising its relationship with infecti ous diseases. In this model, illnesses are \nprimarily perceived as natural phenomena. Hence, th ey should first be described rationally \nand unsentimentally. Second, the methods used to tr eat them are only effective if the body \nwith its bio-chemo-physical characteristics is sepa rated from the personae of patients \u2013who \nactually represent more of a disturbance since they  cannot even be relied upon to \nadequately describe their symptoms. Thirdly and fin ally, this implies that the history of the \nillness overshadows or even occults that of the pat ient. 345  As a result, the somatic model has \ndrastic consequences for the identity and agency of  patients. They are made to feel ignorant \nabout their bodies and when facing the doctor can o nly understand them in terms of a \ndefective mechanism, i.e. \u201can inconvenient dysfunction, an annoying interrupt ion. The \nseparation of body and self is a precondition for t he functioning of the medical enterprise. \nWhen the body is ill it is brought like a car to th e workshop and its inevitable owner is not \ntaken seriously.\u201d 346   \n \nWhile this is not the place to further pursue even a compact history of somatic medicine and \nits alternative or complementary competitors, suffi ce it to say that the increasing credibility \nof phenomenology and its impacts on the cognitive s ciences in the 20 th  century has no doubt \npaved the way towards, if not a really holistic app roach to treatment in conventional \nmedicine, at least to the recognition that there ar e bridges between mental and \nphysiological states. Psychosomatic medicine, psych iatry and psychoanalysis 347  have long \nrecognised the links between mental states and phys ical symptoms. But newer disciplines \nsuch as psychophysiology, 348  the cognitive neurosciences, and the biofeedback t echnologies \n                                                 \n344  Cf.

It could then be sho wn that repeated exposure to certain \nstressors would reinforce personal responses in spe cific parts of the body, thus gradually \ncontributing to the development of so-called lifest yle or civilisation diseases such as \ncoronary heart diseases, cancer, migraines, asthma,  ulcers and related digestive disorders. 351  \n \nThe fact that so-called \u201clifestyle\u201d or \u201ccivilisatio n\u201d diseases are the leading causes of death in \nthe West 352  means that purely mechanistic medical intervention s are bound to not prove \nvery effective since these diseases are essentially  multi-causal: \n                                                                                                                                                         \nhttp://sci2s.ugr.es/publications/ficheros/Psychophy siology-2011.pdf ).

This arch itecture has to be expressed in an algorithm explai ning how \nthe structures and processes may be transformed fro m one level of analysis to another, from a psycholo gical to \na physiological level. Such a strategy, thus, seeks  to understand not only how the architecture of the  mind \ninteracts with structures and processes in the peri pheral physiology and in the brain, but also how th e mind-\ncode is transformed into behavior.\u201d Hugdahl, Kenneth, Psychophysiology , Cambridge & London: Harvard \nUniversity Press, 2001, p. 28.

In 2009, the Federal Statistical \nOffice in Germany (Statistisches Bundesamt Deutschl and) lists the following top-ten leading causes of death: \n\u201echronische isch\u00e4mische Herzkrankheit; akuter Myoka rdinfarkt; Herzinsuffizienz; b\u00f6sartige Neubildung d er \nBronchien und der Lunge; Schlaganfall (nicht als Bl utung oder Infarkt bezeichnet); sonstige chronische  \nobstruktive Lungenkrankheit; Pneumonie (Erreger nic ht n\u00e4her bezeichnet); Hypertensive Herzkrankheit; \nb\u00f6sartige Neubildung des Dickdarmes; b\u00f6sartige Neub ildung der Brustdr\u00fcse (Mamma)\u201c .

Thus, coronary heart \ndiseases, strokes, lung, intestine and breast cance r and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the  main \ncauses of death, leaving only pneumonia as a potent ially \u201cinfectious\u201d disease. To a large extent, thes e figures 96 \n \n \nThe disease model does not transfer well to conditi ons such as essential hypertension (high \nblood pressure) and coronary heart disease [\u2026]. The re is a tendency to look for a discrete \ncause, for something like the bacterial agent of an  infectious disease. None of the major \ndisorders discussed in this textbook can be underst ood in terms of single, discrete causes. For \nexample, the long list of contributors to essential  hypertension may include diet, smoking, \nlack of exercise, personality characteristics, and stress. There is a hereditary component. The \nrisk of hypertension is related to age, race, gende r, and geography. 353  \n \nMedical orientations such as psychosocial or behavi oural medicine have thus begun working \non a more integrative, synthetic approach to treatm ent and healing by laying a lot more \nemphasis on discussing the anamnesis of the disease  with their patients, questioning \nnutritional and sports habits, emotional patterns a nd even spiritual options \u2013be it in term of \nwork-life balance, family and partner support, pers onal values, meditation, etc. The body in \nthis \u201cnew\u201d type of discourse is envisioned not only  as a passive repository of encoded \ngenetic, or more generally biological knowledge but  as a living, cognizant, reactive and \nproactive being. It has clearly acquired a genuine subject position both grammatically and \nfactually: \n \nBodily regulation is possible only if the body has a reasonable amount of control over its \nexternal environment. The world outside the body, f or instance, must move at a pace that is \nin tune with the body\u2019s capabilities; it must be to  some degree, predictable, intelligible, etc. \nThe body must also be able to regulate its internal  environment. It must be able to recognize \nand monitor information about itself (e.g., pain), and be able to mobilize and defend itself \nagainst environmental stressors. 354   \n \nAs in the case of phenomenology that goes back to p re-Cartesian traditions or traditions that \nsurvived only marginally during the Cartesian parad igm, this type of holistic medical \napproach represents an implicit acknowledgement of a Hippocratic or Galenic heritage and it \nheavily draws on insights that have long been champ ioned by complementary and \nalternative medical practices. 355  However slow and sometimes grudging, this ideologi cal turn \n                                                                                                                                                         \ncorrelate with those provided by e.g. the Austrian Bundesantalt Statistik: \nhttp://www.statistik.at/web_en/statistics/health/ca uses_of_death/causes_of_death_at_a_glance/index.htm l  \n(figures for 2009); by the Swiss Bundesamt f\u00fcr Stat istik: \nhttp://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/ 14/02/04/key/01.html  (figures for 2008) , by the UK \nOffice for National Statistics: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/STATBASE/ssdataset.asp ?vlnk=9785  (figures for \n2007 can be downloaded from here in Excel or CSV ve rsions); by the French Institut National de la Stat istique et \ndes Etudes Economiques: http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?ref_id=na tfps06205  (figures for 2008); \nand by the American Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, cf. \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm  (figures for 2007).

Moreo ver, in the context of multi-factorial diseases, th e \nburden of \u201escientific proof\u201c becomes almost unbeara ble, because of the constraints it places on clinic al trial \ndesign (e.g. the necessity of several control group s, the time factor since the evolution of civilisat ion diseases is \noften very long-winded and may \u201eoutlive\u201c the existe nce of research teams and funding, etc.). 97 \n \nthus recognises that not just body \u201cmechanics\u201d but the whole person, her/his lifestyle and \nenvironment 356  must come back into the bigger medical picture:   \n \nFor bodily \u201cregulation\u201d the mind actively collabora tes with physiological processes. The true \nmeaning of \u201cpsychosomatic\u201d here then is not the sim plistic idea of control by the mind \n\u201cover\u201d the body, but is rather an interactive proce ss, psyche and soma influencing each \nother. 357  \n \nUnfortunately, this turn has not proved as radical as the phenomenological revolution in \nother sciences. The specific \u201ccorps v\u00e9cu\u201d of patien ts may be increasingly taken into account \nin the medical equation but the scientific expertis e model \u2013despite having experienced a \nnumber of setbacks\u2013 remains extremely powerful, be it just symbolically. 358  Moreover, \npromising branches such as gene therapy or mainstre am practices such as evidence-based \nmedicine 359  retain a very positivistic, object-centred perspec tive on the body. Nevertheless, \nall these body trends, from phenomenology to cognit ive science, through psychophysiology \nand integrative medicine, have left their mark upon  the cultural substratum on which the \nmarketing and appropriation of HLTs could grow. Obv iously, the embodied mind concept as \ndeveloped around HLTs does not display the sophisti cation of phenomenological theories or \ncognitive experiments since HLTs are designed for l ay health consumers who are \nnevertheless perceived as knowledgeable and autonom ous enough to invest in a number of \nrelatively pleasurable preventive measures.  \n \nThis empowerment appears increasingly necessary in societies stuck between the necessity \nof both text and body and the nostalgia for lost te xtual and/or bodily faith inherent to \npostmodernism (as already hinted at in the \u201cUnder t he sign of the body\u201d  section):  \n \n[\u2026] a double failure is given: a failure to produce  a discourse on the body, also the failure not \nto produce discourse on it. A double bind, a psycho sis. I have finished talking about the body, \nand I have not yet begun. I will never stop talking  about it, and this body from which I speak \nwill never be able to speak, neither about itself n or about me. It will never experience \nspeech\u2019s jouissance , and speech will never enjoy it. 360   \n                                                 \n356  In this respect Kathleen F.

Th e \npilgrimage to integrative medicine, to wellness, ha s just begun. [...] The birth of integrative medici ne will force \nthe medical establishment to form previously unhear d of alliances with practitioners once shunned by W estern \nmedicine. Transforming the course of our nation\u2019s c urative path, our sick care system will become obso lete. \nNew strategies, blending the spiritual, emotional a nd natural with high-tech procedures, will evolve. Although it \nmay seem overwhelming, this change is close at hand .\u201d  But it remains interesting because it prophesies f or the \nmedical establishment what has already long taken p lace in the realm of HLTs and their commodification .  \n357  Cf.

The s elf is also under attack from the various \nhard sciences, which claim to be able to explain ph enomena normally aligned with the self in \npurely electro-chemical terms: moods, emotions, act ions, temperament--everything can be \nexplained in terms of biology. The postmodern body is hollow in the sense that it \"contains\" \nnothing which transcends the material world. 361  \n \nHowever, Dieter Mersch contends that we are in fact  pursuing the Idealism dream in a \ntechnological guise, through the \u201ctechnologisation of the bios\u201d , but that this dream of a \nphilosophy or technology forever rid of the impurit y of body, hence matter, is absurd. 362  He \nthen shows how the \u201cperformative\u201d undermines the co nditions of this idealism and \nmathematical constructivism: \n \nThe fact that the performative cannot be renounced hints to the fact that something \nprecedes the mediatisation and technologisations, s omething that comes before  any design, \nconstruction or invention, something, which like a first gesture has always been already \n\u201cthere\u201d: the placing of their ex-sistence . It \u201cgives\u201d them being. Certainly, there is no pre sence, \nno body, no performativity without the medium \u2013 but no sign, no embodiment and no \nmedium is ever the \u201ccatalyst\u201d of its own happening .363  \n \nSo here we are, back to the elusive body medium \u2013bo th the shifty (empty?) performative \nmedium as well as the potential transcendental chan nel communicating with the spirit\u2013 that \nnevertheless remains our only rampart against, if n ot the post-modern angst, at least late \nmodern or reflexive modern insecurities. Ulrich Bec k, Elizabeth Beck-Gernsheim, Anthony \nGiddens and Scott Lash are some of the most promine nt sociologists to have analysed and \ndescribed what was perhaps too rashly labelled as p ost-modernity, in terms of late or \nreflexive modernity and its retinue of increasing i ndividualisation, uncertainty and risk. 364  \n                                                 \n361  Sheridan, David M, The Rhetoric of Surface and Dep th: a hypertext, ReSoundings , volume 2, issue 2, Summer \n1998, SN 91.

It is  performed in various geographical \ndimensions: transnational, national and local. Actu ally, the above-mentioned researchers \nsee one of the most meaningful triggers of this gra dual shift as the gradual dissolution of \ntraditional nation-bound identities and activities in favour of sweeping, economically \ninduced, globalising trends. Another extremely sign ificant accelerator is without doubt the \nambivalent status of technology, as discussed in th e \u201cTechnology\u201d section \u2013especially with \nrespect to its unforeseen side-effects. 365  In this increasingly shifting, disenchanted paradi gm, \nthe body and its health acquire a new dimension, \u201ca  transcendental meaning\u201d without which \n\u201ceverything else is nothing\u201d:   \n \nHealth as a secular expectation of salvation and he alth as pressure to perform in \nindividualized market society, are two of the drivi ng forces behind the rise of the \u2018health \nproject\u2019. The characteristic striving for health in  the modern world \u2013 for what critics describe \nas a cult fetish or a phantom \u2013 is thus not merely an expression of personal inclinations, \ncompulsions or neuroses. Rather, it is part of the global project of modernity, of the new \nmalleability of life with all its opportunities, ch ecks and pressures. 366  \n \nHegemonic globalisation and technologisation have t hus generated new organisational \nforms while simultaneously contributing to the obso lescence, erosion or re-structuring of \nmany traditional arrangements. In this context, ind ividuals are confronted with many more \n\u201clife management\u201d choices than ever before: almost anything is possible but hardly anything \nis really lasting or reassuring \u2013be it professional  choices, romantic and family involvements \nor financial investments. In parallel, sources of g uidance are so manifold, ubiquitous and \ncontradictory that they represent more of a confusi ng factor than an adjuvant. But at the \nsame time, there is increased social pressure to se ek achievement and self-fulfilment. Thus, \nas we already noted it in Chapter 1 ( Introduction ), the body is often paradoxically viewed as \nboth a refuge against the uncertainties escaping in dividual control and one of the uncertain \nmeans to attain self-actualisation. The body and it s health have in fact became the central \nicon of reflexive modernisation since more than any  other entity, it blurs and problematises \nboundaries and taken-for-granted assumptions, throu gh its irreducibility to either nature or \ntechnology, object or subject, matter or spirit.   \n \nThus, in my dissertation, embodied consciousness  is used to refer to the paradigm of the \nholistic body, viewed not only as a system of inter dependent physiological functions but as \nan experiential and potentially transcendental enti ty, i.e. inseparably bound to emotional, \nmental and even spiritual dimensions. HLTs reflect this vision in that they span anything from \nfitness workouts, natural cosmetics or functional f oods to sensuous massage, mental and \nemotional stress relief, and spiritual connection \u2013 often in packages or interdependent \nconstellations. In this realm, the body is thus no longer a given, but a space and  a medium \nfor the creation, development and preservation of t he self: it may in fact represent our only \n\u201creliable\u201d sense of selfhood. Linked to the primacy  of experience,  embodied consciousness  \nalso marks a shift in authoritative knowledge: we a re moving away from a direct, exogenous \n\u201cexpertise model\u201d to what I would describe as an as sisted, endogenous \u201cbody know-how\u201d. \nIn this context, consumers are increasingly suppose d to know what their bodies want while \n                                                 \n365  Cf. Beck, Ulrich, Risikogesellschaft: auf dem Weg in eine andere Mode rne , op. cit. \n366  Beck, Ulrich & Beck-Gernsheim, Elisabeth, op. cit. , p.141 100 \n \nproducers and mediators represent the midwives in t his process, \u201cgently\u201d suggesting \nproducts, processes, services, strategies to \u201chelp\u201d  consumers birth, reinforce or simply cater \nto their embodied consciousness. And since the rule  of the cogito has been definitively \nchallenged by the corps v\u00e9cu,  a strong embodied subjectivity can be made to embr ace \ndimensions that a rationalising consciousness might  dismiss as esoteric drivel. Hence, within \nthe logic of subjective body needs, it suddenly mak es sense to expend huge amounts of \nmoney, time and effort to manage the body-self in a ll the variety of its incarnate and more \nethereal manifestations.  \n \nTherefore, a quick excursion along the shelves of c ontemporary German supermarkets (or a \nsurvey of health-related services) reveals that, wh ile it has not completely died out, the \npositivist tradition that confidently bequeathed us  the likes of the 1950s radioactive face \nmask I mentioned in my Introduction  is currently overwhelmed by a range of \u201csupernatur al\u201d \nproducts and services. At first glance, they promis e to provide consumers with the best of \nlate modernity\u2019s schizophrenic division of labour \u2013  i.e. high-tech expertise and security \ncombined with natural care. But they do more than t hat: they overlap \u201chorizontally\u201d in the \nsense that food, cosmetics, health supplements, (ne wer and older) movement traditions as \nwell alternative health practices are perceived as increasingly co-dependent in the design of \na healthy body. And they overlap \u201cvertically\u201d: as i n my initial \u201cbathing\u201d examples, beyond \ncosmetic performance (i.e. cleansing or purifying),  these products are increasingly seen as \ninfluencing emotional or mental resilience. Finally , some of them are even designed to \ninfluence spiritual awareness: they promise to awak en the \u201cBuddha on the Brain\u201d 367  \u2013but \nwithout the strenuous meditation practice...  \n \nThese developments could well be linked to the rema rks made by economist Robert Fogel in \nan article entitled \u201cCatching up with the economy\u201d .368  His main postulate is that economics \nas a discipline is lagging behind the economy becau se it does not sufficiently take into \naccount what he calls \u201ctechnophysio evolution\u201d  that is the \u201caccelerating rate of technological \nchange\u201d  and \u201cthe implications of this acceleration for the rest ructuring of the economy, and \nits transforming effect on human beings\u201d .369  Among other things, this has a tremendous \nimpact on the evolution of what Fogel calls the \u201cno n-market\u201d or leisure sector (or even \n                                                 \n367  The expression stems from John Geirland in his art icle \u201cBuddha on the Brain: The hot new frontier of \nneuroscience: meditation! (Just ask the Dalai Lama. )\u201d, Wired , Issue 14.02, February 2006, online: \nhttp://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.02/dalai.html  In it, the author discusses the controversies \nsurrounding the research conducted by Richard David son at the Waisman Laboratory for Brain Imaging and  \nBehavior in Madison (WI), USA, where Buddhist monks  vs. a control group of college students \u2013all under  EEG\u2013 \nwere asked to meditate on \u201cunconditional loving-kindness and compassion\u201d . The former then \u201cproduced \ngamma waves that were 30 times as strong as the stu dents'. In addition, larger areas of the meditators ' brains \nwere active, particularly in the left prefrontal co rtex, the part of the brain responsible for positiv e emotions\u201d . \nThis research was seen as shedding important light \u201con the ability to change brain function through tr aining\u201d by \nincreasing neural connections despite ageing factor s.\u201d  [\u2026] \u201cBut Davidson saw something more. The monks had \nresponded to the request to meditate on compassion by generating remarkable brain waves. Perhaps these  \nsignals indicated that the meditators had attained an intensely compassionate state of mind. If so, th en maybe \ncompassion could be exercised like a muscle; with t he right training, people could bulk up their empat hy. And if \nmeditation could enhance the brain's ability to pro duce \"attention and affective processes\" - emotions , in the \ntechnical language of Davidson's study - it might a lso be used to modify maladaptive emotional respons es like \ndepression.\u201d  [website accessed Aug. 2011]  \n368  Fogel, Robert W., \u201cCatching up with the Economy\u201d, The American Economic Review , Vol. 89, No. 1, March \n1999, pp. 1-21. \n369  Ibid., pp. 2 & 1. 101 \n \nvolwork as opposed to earnwork) that has grown at a n amazing pace from the 18 th  century \nonwards. Another aspect affected by these changes a re aging and morbidity factors which \nFogel argues would be better captured by \u201cshifting to life-cycle data sets for successive \ncohorts and to intergenerational data sets\u201d  instead of \u201ccross sectional data sets\u201d .370  Finally \nFogel makes a case for the inclusion of a momentous  neglect:  \n \nThe final section points to the impact of cultural lag in the treatment of material inequality, \nand the neglect of the more severe problem of spiri tual inequality. I use the word spiritual \nnot in its religious sense but as a reference to co mmodities that lack material form. Spiritual \nor immaterial commodities make up most of the consu mption in the United States and other \nrich countries today. 371   \n \nHe shows that perceived diachronically, self-realis ation is a pursuit that has become \nincreasingly democratised in rich nations since, co mpared to the previous century, the \npoverty line has significantly dropped in terms of real income. Although Fogel mainly focuses \non moral and intellectual/cultural components such as upbringing or education when \nreferring to \u201cspiritual\u201d commodities, I feel his an alysis sheds an interesting light on the \nfunction of HLTs. These technologies, while often r etaining a fair degree of materiality, are \ncrossbred with spiritual (here in the sense of tran scendent or more holistic) clues if not \ndownright values \u2013thus maybe also mirroring a growi ng need to counterbalance or at least \nattenuate the stringent demands of \u201ctechnophysio ev olution\u201d. \n \nThus, the aim of this section was to explore how HL Ts and their strange recombinant \ncommodification have been fostered by a revolution of cultural values centred on the body. \nWe thus examined how parallel, often cross-fertiliz ing research in the humanities as well as \nin the \u201chard\u201d and \u201csofter\u201d sciences contributed to usher in an era of renewed attention to \nthe role of the body \u2013especially in the generation of perception, cognition, experience and \nconsciousness. We noted that this research called i nto question the modernist body/mind \ndivide, and ultimately reinstated the body as a cen tral (if often unreliable) locus of \n\u201cselfhood\u201d production. Simultaneously, we witnessed  the impact that this change of \nparadigm had for the legitimisation of HLTs, throug h the transfer of authority and knowledge \nto embodied consciousness.  \n \nAs stated in my initial Gilles Deleuze epigraph \u2013\u201c Believing is no longer believing in another \nworld, in a transformed world. It is only believing  in the body, it is restituting discourse to the \nbody and therefore, attaining the body before disco urse, before words\u201d \u2013 this form of \nconsciousness requires believing in the body as a \u201c body\u201d of knowledge and authority which \nprecludes or transcends discourse. Ironically howev er \u2013as we saw\u2013 the very possibility of this \nbelief is generated and structured by the cultural discourses that re-enthroned the body. \nThis then is the strange status of this new ideolog y: a body perceived as an ultimate \nontological refuge in an environment where scientif ic, moral and religious certainties have \nbeen greatly discredited, but a refuge still riddle d with the contradictions that contributed to \nits creation.   \n \nThe next chapter will provide us with a historical perspective on the roots and the evolution \nof the fitness and wellness ideologies that feed in to my HLT concept.  \n                                                 \n370  Ibid., p. 7. \n371  Ibid., p. 1.  102 \n \nCHAPTER 4  \nA NEW FORM OF LIFESTYLE DISCRIMINATION? MAKING SENS E OF FITNESS \nAND WELLNESS IN A HISTORICAL CONTEXT \n \nConcentrated on the job \u2013 full of energy for a hobb y, taxofit Vitamin E . Whoever wants to \nmove on, to achieve more, both in their job and dur ing leisure, requires taxofit Vitamin E . \nHighly dosed vitamin E activates your cells. It imp roves the absorption of oxygen and thus \nincreases your bodily and mental performance, provi ding strength, energy and stamina as \nwell as preserving sexual potency .372  \n \nIntroduction 373  \nAn enduring ad for taxofit Vitamin E  \u2013first launched in 1985\u2013 aptly illustrates how the  fitness \nethic permeates both the work and leisure realms. T he above-quoted caption accompanies \ntwo snapshots: the first one shows an elegant woman  sitting at a desk in a professional \nenvironment holding a marker over a pile of papers.  Her serious gaze is intently fixed on an \ninterlocutor behind the photographer; her half open  mouth suggests that she is busy \ndiscussing something. The second one displays the s ame woman clad in a white martial arts \nuniform. The photographer has just caught her leapi ng in the air, one fist punching forward \nwhile the other arm is balanced behind her. Her hai r is brushed up by the motion and her \nmouth is wide open suggesting that she is shouting.  Clearly, the woman is supposed to be \njust as competitive at work as in her free time: co ncentration and energy are just two faces \nof the same performance coin. Indeed, qualities suc h as self-discipline, motivation, \nperseverance, precision, etc. are seen to power bot h realms with equal intensity. With the \nadvent of wellness, this blurring of boundaries bet ween work and leisure carries on but in \nsofter, subtler ways. \n  \nTherefore, my ambition in this chapter is neither t o provide a linear history of health \npromotion, prevention and associated healthy lifest yle technologies (HLTs), nor is it to build \na coherently global historical framework or even co mpile an exhaustive catalogue of \npotential historical roots and offshoots. 374  An entirely different, much more source-intensive \ndiachronic inquiry would be necessary to fulfil the se goals \u2013thus side-tracking my original \nintent. Instead, in the spirit of the eclectic ques tioning characterising my theoretical section, \nI want to investigate the implications of the healt h ethics mind-split that revolves around \ndisciplining vs. gently caring for the body \u2013be it at work or outside. Concretely, before \nsketching an idiosyncratic historical backdrop of t hese two often intertwined ideologies, I \n                                                 \n372  Bunte , Heft 16, 1985. The ad appears several times durin g that year and thereafter, over a ten-year span at  \nleast. \n373  An article I published in 2005 has provided the ba sic articulations and many of the seminal ideas for  this \nchapter. I quote extensively \u2013sometimes literally\u2013 from it here without footnoting each instance becau se it \nwould represent many more footnotes in an already f ootnote-heavy narrative and because I like to think  that \nmy research has matured considerably since then. Cf . Bingle, Gwen, \u201cWorking out for well-being: how fi tness \nand wellness have reframed the paradoxes of body le isure\u201d, Manufacturing Leisure , Helsinki: National \nConsumer Research Centre, online publication, pp. 2 35-255: \nhttp://www.kuluttajatutkimuskeskus.fi/files/4717/20 05_01_publications_manufacturingleisure.pdf . [website \naccessed Aug. 2011]  \n374  However, in the \u201eTime frame: why focus on the \u2018lat e twentieth century?\u2019\u201d section of Chapter 2 \n(Methodology), I have already provided a few semina l roots and offshoots in order to justify my focus on the \nlate 20 th  century.  103 \n \nfirst tackle the role-model function and genealogy of modern health and beauty \u201capostles\u201d \nas well as the development of a late modern form of  internalised lifestyle discrimination.   \n \nHealthy heralds of self-enterprise \n \nChristine Kaufmann found herself ugly. She was afra id and insecure. Until she discovered \nhealthy eating. The actress has now published a boo k about her path to beauty and self-\nconfidence. 375  \n \nOver five pages, \u201cShe eats her way into happiness\u201d  a 1989 article in Bunte  (a popular \ncelebrities magazine) features the new lifestyle of  Christine Kaufmann, a 40-year old actress \nwho has just written a book entitled \u201cBody Harmony\u201d .376  Even though the trajectory of the \nugly and fearful duckling to the beautiful and inde pendent swan does not just rely on food, \nfood represents a lead that is subsequently exploit ed to broaden the perspective to holistic \nliving. The epiphany style of this narrative is not  altogether a novelty: during the confusing \nperiods when new technologies or newly articulated (body) ideologies are being introduced \nand consolidated, the agency of lead-consumers ofte n plays a key-role in enabling the \nconcrete translation of abstract notions and the ap propriation of unfamiliar products into \neveryday life. Indeed, before-and-after stories rec ounting the transition from a state of \nbodily, emotional, or spiritual misery to a state o f blessed enlightenment boast a long-\nestablished tradition: from Saint Paul, through Pas cal to Mary Baker Eddy, they draw on \nstrong (para-)religious or philosophical traditions . But in the late 19 th  and early 20 th  century \nin Germany (and elsewhere), they became an establis hed if still marginal genre amongst so-\ncalled \u201clife reformers\u201d, such as e.g. Louis Kuhne:  \n \nBecause these individuals\u2019 lives and thinking were organized entirely around the poles of \n\u201chealth\u201d and \u201cillness\u201d, they perhaps considered the  story of their own suffering to be a \nmatter of interest to the public and, thus, repress ed feelings of shame that prevented others \nfrom sharing such stories with a wider audience. Th e public representation of one\u2019s suffering \nwas, however, also a means for the authors to reass ure themselves that their suffering was \nnow firmly in the past and that they had found the high road to health, happiness, and \nbeauty, as they revealed to their readers. Seen in this light, these stories dramatized failure \nin order to demonstrate the ultimate success of the ir authors and the success that converts \nto life reform could expect. 377   \n \nHowever, what is truly new in the case of Christine  Kaufmann is the avowedly aesthetic and \nemotional challenge faced by the actress. Indeed, s he has neither recovered from cancer nor \novercome godlessness but accessed a means to positi vely assert her identity as a \nharmoniously secure person. Food and associated HLT s have become key-components of a \n                                                 \n375  Lammert, Heidemarie, \u201cSie i\u00dft sich gl\u00fccklich\u201c, Bunte , Heft 18, April 25 th , 1985, p.128: \u201eChristine Kaufmann \nfand sich selbst h\u00e4sslich, Sie hatte Angst und war unsicher.

In this s ection of his book, Hau discusses the autobiographi es of \nprominent and less prominent life reformers such as  Louis Kuhne, a 19 th  century German health entrepreneur \n[1835\u20131901], who in 1898 published a book entitled \u201cThe New Healing Science\u201d which enjoyed a considera ble \nresonance amongst health aficionados of the period.  104 \n \nholistic makeover. No doubt, the most interesting p art of the article is a sort of photo-\nnovella over two pages that features six photograph s with captions illustrating high-points in \nChristine\u2019s daily routine, such as exercising, buyi ng and preparing healthy food, grooming \nand enjoying a relaxing evening with friends. 378   \n \nIn the first photograph, she is pictured on her bed room floor, wearing a leotard and leggings \nand squatting on two hands and one knee, the other leg projecting up and backwards. The \ntext reads: \u201c 1. The morning begins with gymnastics. Christine Ka ufmann exercises every day. \nBut only as long as she feels like it. Any constrai nt is the enemy of beauty and inner harmony. \nGymnastics are important for the skin and the metab olism.\u201d 379  Beyond functional aspects, it \nis suggested that gymnastics represents the first s tep in a sophisticated holistic routine. \nChristine is described as a disciplined person but with an ear attuned to her inner needs.  \n \nThe second picture shows the actress clad in a loos e-fitting night gown and bathrobe \u2013her \nhair hardly ruffled\u2013 towering above a table where a  fruit basket is prominently displayed as \nwell as various bowls containing healthy-looking fo ods. The photograph catches her in the \nact of pouring milk on her cereals and the text run s thus: \u201c2. Breakfast determines the day\u2019s \nwell-being. The smaller and healthier the morning m eal, the better one feels. Christine \nKaufmann eats yogurt with brewer\u2019s yeast and fruit and she also takes vitamin and mineral \npills.\u201d 380  The importance of healthy eating is stressed here for the second time in the article. \nBut, apparently, healthy natural foods do not suffi ce: they have to be supplemented with \nindustrially produced micro-nutrients.  \n \nChristine is then shown riding on her bike \u2013 elegan tly dressed in a rain coat, high-heeled \ntight-fitting boots and sunglasses \u2013 alongside a ri ver and against an urban landscape. The \ncommentary reads: \u201c3. Christine Kaufmann mostly commutes by bike \u2013 si nce she doesn\u2019t own \na car. She even takes her bike when travelling. Bic ycling stimulates circulation, has a \npreventive effect against orange skin. Moroever, it  makes one independent.\u201d 381  This third \ncharacteristic of the actress\u2019s everyday life once again foregrounds sports as a health and \nbeauty-enhancer, highlighting the fight against ora nge skin \u2013the great enemy of the \nsedentary age. The caption somewhat surprisingly en ds with a reference to one of the early \nmotifs associated with women and bicycling: it is o bviously important to portray Christine as \nfully mastering not only her health rationales but also as independently governing all the \naspects of her life. 382   \n \nThe next photograph depicts the actress \u2013dressed st ylishly and sporting a hat\u2013 holding a \nwicker shopping basket and peering at goods over a counter in what looks like a cross \nbetween an indoor market and a supermarket. The acc ompanying text declares: \u201c4. Just as \n                                                 \n378  Lammert, Heidemarie, op. cit., pp. 130-131. \n379  Ibid., p. 130: \u201eDer Morgen begint mit Gymnastik. Christine Kaufman n turnt t\u00e4glich. Aber nur solange sie Lust \ndazu hat. Jeder Zwang ist der Feind von Sch\u00f6nheit u nd innerer Harmonie.

Ch ristine Kaufmann not only patronises \nhealth food stores, but also goes to weekly markets  and supermarkets. The decisive aspect \nhere is the quality and not the quantity of goods.\u201d383  Thus, according to Christine, everyday \nlife tasks do not necessarily exude boredom: instea d, they should be infused with a \nhedonistic ethic. Moreover, it is precisely in a ro utine task such as shopping that the agency \nof the discriminating individual is the most decisi ve: consumers here are depicted as \nwielding the power to pick and mix goods in order t o satisfy their own health imperatives \u2013\nwithout slavishly abiding with health food.  \n \nThe following snapshot offers an intimate peak into  the actress\u2019s bathroom. She is shown \nsporting wet hair, sitting in a sea of foam her han ds coyly turning her face towards the \nphotographer \u2013 a plant, a towel and a cocktail glas s are her only props along with the bath \ntub. \u201c 5. This is the beauty care routine after work is ov er: a bath to relax. The skin is \nexfoliated with a special sponge. The face is nurtu red with natural cosmetics. This is a daily \nprogramme for Kaufmann.\u201d 384  is the text inserted in the picture. Hygiene and c osmetic care \nare the next stage in Christine\u2019s routine. But havi ng a bath is not just instrumental to \nbeautifying and caring, it primarily serves a more holistic purpose, the need for recreation \nand enjoyment. In the actress\u2019s life, however, even  relaxation has a programmatic drift to it. \n \nFinally, Christine is shown socialising. The settin g is elegant, a nicely laid table with candles, \nflowers and wine, presumably in a restaurant (but u ncharacteristic enough to also be a \nprivate home). A group of people are eating and tal king around the table. The photographer \nhas just caught the actress smiling mischievously, as her neighbour, an elegant man, turns to \nembrace her closely or whisper something in her ear . The last blurb hammers it in: \u201c 6. An \nevening with friends makes one happy \u2013 and beautifu l. Here again for Christine Kaufmann, \nthe pleasure principle is valid: one can also get c arried away from time to time. In the \nevenings, she dissociates her food intake, choosing  between protein and carbohydrates.\u201d 385  \nHappiness here is also seen as the fruit of a posit ive environment and as an important \nbeauty catalyser. But even in this relaxed context,  control is never far below the surface: \nsinning may be allowed but always within a very res tricted framework.  \n \nThe actress\u2019s free time thus seems to be mainly tak en up with the streamlining of both her \nbody and emotions, in a constant attempt to attain a balance between the two. This state of \nmind is reinforced by three small slogans emblazone d on diagonal banners on the top right \nhand corner of each double page: \u201c1. The biggest enemy of beauty is laziness\u201d ; \u201c2. All sins \nare allowed but not everyday\u201d and \u201c3. The best make-up comes from the soul\u201d .386  \nInterestingly enough, the slogans are couched in ca techistic terms, which point to the fact \nthat both body-work and body-leisure have attained the status of a new all-absorbing \n                                                 \n383 : Lammert, Heidemarie, op. cit., p. 130: \u201eDas Einkaufen soll wie das Essen lustvoll bleiben.  Chrisitne \nKaufmann gehst nicht nur in Reformh\u00e4user, sondern a uch auf Wochen- und Superm\u00e4rkte. Ganz entscheidend \ndabei ist die Qualit\u00e4t, nicht die Quantit\u00e4t der War e.\u201c  \n384  Ibid., p. 130: \u201eDas ist die Sch\u00f6nheitspflege nach gtaner Arbeit: e in Vollbad zur Entspannung.

F\u00fcr Christine Kaufmann gilt auch hier das \nLustprinzip: Man darf auch mal \u00fcber die Str\u00e4nge sch lagen. Abends achtet sie auf Trennkost \u2013 nur Eiwei\u00df  oder \nnur Kohlehydrate.\u201c  \n386  Ibid. p. 129: \u201eDer gr\u00f6sste Feind der Sch\u00f6nheit ist die Faulheit\u201d , p. 131; \u201eAlle S\u00fcnde sind erlaubt aber nicht \nt\u00e4glich\u201c ; p. 132: \u201eDas beste Make-up kommt aus der Seele\u201c . 106 \n \nreligion (or at least a serious ontological quest),  and that this type of health narrative is still \nstrongly connected to the spiritual and philosophic al traditions I mentioned earlier on.   \n \nJust as when resorting to advertising as a source, one can argue that this type of feature \narticle presents an extremely stilised (in this cas e one could even say staged hence distorted) \nvision into the reality of everyday life. Indeed, C hristine\u2019s routine is the object of a clever \nmise-en-sc\u00e8ne, first portraying her as a sexy princ ess picking at her salad in a theatre on the \ntitle photograph, before photogenically displaying her in harmoniously controlled settings. \nThus the seemingly voyeuristic peak afforded into t he actress\u2019s life appears not only \nconsenting but even actively co-engineered as a con scious self-entrepreneurship move \u2013\nsince beyond her lead-consumer status as a celebrit y, Christine has also just authored a book \non holistic living.    \n \nNevertheless, beyond the apparent physical perfecti on of the role-model, beyond the \npedagogical tone of the article and its programmati c caricature of a healthy everyday life, I \ncontend that it offers a privileged vista into some  of the crucial tensions of the period. To my \nmind, it is not so much the exact components of thi s particular lifestyle that are primarily \ninteresting. Rather, it is the oppositions or incon sistencies in the expos\u00e9 of the lifestyle that \nare the most revealing. In Christine Kaufmann\u2019s cas e, one senses that the management of \nher everyday life and by extension her persona, piv ots on the difficult negotiation of a \nnumber of interlinked dichotomies: work and leisure , order and freedom, regularity and \nexception, pleasure and rationality, nature and tec hnology, emotion and control, matter and \nspirit and last but not least: fitness and wellness . These dichotomies are alternately blurred \nand reinforced throughout the article. For instance , the professional and private domains are \nstrictly separated visually. However, in the work r ealm, Christine is not presented on stage \nbut taking a lunch break. In contrast, the snapshot s from the leisure realm mostly show her \nperforming banal, routine and repetitive tasks that  engross a lot of her energy and attention.  \n \nChristine\u2019s emblematic lifestyle is but one instanc e of a trend that has gathered impetus to \nthis day. Nowadays, global heroines and heroes \u2013be it in show-business, fashion, politics or \nbusiness\u2013 are regularly marketed as identification figures or role models, not just in terms of \ndress or general lifestyle but increasingly as heal thy icons:  \n \nLeisure is not a cure-all but once people have acce ss to the best medical attention, and when \nthey have achieved benign working and living condit ions, their lifestyles are likely to become \nmajor discriminators of health status. People in th ese conditions seem aware of this. The \npursuit of health has become a prominent lifestyle goal among sections of the upper middle \nclasses (see Savage et al., 1992). They are less li kely to be victims of a postmodern insecurity \n(see chapter 8) than people who simply realize that  how they spend their leisure can affect \ntheir health, and that lifestyle factors are health  determinants over which they can exercise \ndirect and immediate control. 387  \n \nA particularly interesting example of this shift wa s the health odyssey of Joschka Fischer, the \nForeign Minister and Vice Chancellor of Germany fro m 1998 to 2005, who launched his own \nphysical fitness \u201cgospel\u201d, 388  documenting his struggle to shed weight and become  fit \n                                                 \n387  Roberts, Kenneth, Leisure in Contemporary Society . Wallingford & New York: CABI Publishing, 1999, p.  12. \n388  Fischer, Joschka, Mein langer Lauf zu mir selbst, K\u00f6ln: Kiepenheuer und Witsch, 1999. For a brief ove rview of \nhis fitness tribulations, cf. e.g. Kunz, Martin, \u201cD er Jo-Jo-Joschka\u201d, Focus  Magazin , 17.05.2004, online version: \nhttp://www.focus.de/kultur/leben/fitness-der-jo-jo- joschka_aid_200934.html . Echoing its title, the article 107 \n \nbetween 1996 and 1998. His story is also framed as a \u201cbefore-after\u201d narrative articulated \naround what most people would describe as a mid-lif e crisis (involving a marital fiasco and a \ndeep sense of personal failure). Moreover, it is em blematic of a marked change in celebrity \ncult: even for men in the late 20 th  century, artistic, political or economic success a nd \nrespectability are no longer measured in terms of p rosperous-looking bellies maintained by \npartaking in Trimalchio-style banquets and swilling  gallons of claret. Instead, excess flab and \na poor condition have become the signs of a lack of  self-control, which is seen as reflecting \nlimited efficiency in the professional sphere.   \n \nWhereas prior religious, philosophical or healthful  enlightenment remained the province of a \nfew exceptionally questioning (or exceptionally unw ell) and often charismatic individuals, \nthe type of individuation challenge taken up by Chr istine Kaufmann or Joschka Fischer is no \nlonger strictly limited to a marginal or elitist la yer of society. And in Kaufmann\u2019s case the \nyardstick is not a prevalent notion of desirable sp iritual development or bodily health, it is a \nhighly internalised and subjective marker since the  emphasis is on feeling well, beautiful or \nmore confident. So even if the goal is individual d evelopment and even if there is an obvious \ntrickle-down effect from lead- to anonymous consume rs, the trajectory is one that can and \nshould be emulated by the majority \u2013especially sinc e HLTs are more readily available for \nappropriation than arcane religious or philosophica l revelations. Thus, this \u201csubjective \nconsumption turn\u201d means that health and beauty comp etence is no longer the exclusive \nprovince of marginal eccentrics, austere reformers,  highly-trained experts or glamorous \ncelebrities. 389  Especially with the advent of Web 2.0, a whole new  generation of relatively \nanonymous health \u201cengineers\u201d has emerged \u2013their fol lowing largely a function of their self-\npresentation skills. 390  This shift can be traced back to the 1980s zeitgei st that promoted the \nchallenge of pursuing positive personal autonomy: \n \nThe cult of performance takes off in the course of the 1980s by means of three shifts. Sports \nchampions have become symbols of social excellence,  whereas they used to be the sign of \npopular backwardness. Consumption has become a moto r of self-realisation, whereas \npreviously it used to imply alienation and passivit y. The company director has become a role \nmodel, whereas he used to be the emblem of the empl oyer\u2019s domination over the worker. \nThis cult thus inaugurated new mythologies enabling  everyone to adapt to a major \ntransformation: the decline of discipline in favour  of autonomy. Personal fulfilment and \nindividual initiative are the two facets of this ne w rule of the social game. 391    \n                                                                                                                                                         \nconcludes that this transformation may have been ju st a phase in Fischer\u2019s eventful life since his cur rent \ngenerous girth seems to testify to the fact that he  has less time for sports due to his busy schedule,  has \nremarried and rediscovered gastronomic pleasures.

La \nconsommation est un vecteur de r\u00e9alisation personne lle alors qu'elle connotait auparavant l'ali\u00e9nation  et la \npassivit\u00e9. Le chef d'entreprise est devenu un mod\u00e8l e de conduite alors qu'il \u00e9tait l'embl\u00e8me de la dom ination du \npatron sur l'ouvrier. Ce culte inaugurait ainsi de nouvelles mythologies permettant \u00e0 chacun de s'adap ter \u00e0 une 108 \n \n \nNevertheless, even though autonomy seems to be the hallmark of late modern \nperformance, discipline has not really vanished fro m the scene but has been internalised in \norder to attain a socially acceptable or desirable version of autonomy. The above quote \nactually betrays this normalised internalisation: t he sports champion is no longer a wonder \nor a freak of nature but a successfully disciplined  Joe Bloggs \u2013just as an actress no longer \nrepresents either a lowlife or an ethereal idol but  a hard-working if talented individual. \nSimilarly, consumption is no longer perceived as so mething that dominates consumers but a \ndimension that the latter should aptly enrol in ord er to design their identities. Finally, the \nlast statement emphasises the fact that, beyond suc cessfully managing other people, the \nmanager has become a positive emblem of self-manage ment. In all these examples, success \nor fulfilment is no longer a matter of fate but of sustained personal effort guided by subtle \nnormative imperatives, even if the setting may appe ar easy-going or spontaneous: \n \nWhatever the domain considered (corporation, school , family), the rules of the world have \nchanged. They are no longer obedience, discipline o r moral conformity but flexibility, change, \nspeed of reaction, etc. Self-mastery, psychological  and emotional suppleness, action \npotential mean that everyone must endure the burden  of permanently adapting to a world \nthat is precisely losing its permanence, an instabl e, temporary world, characterised by flux \nand see-saw trajectories. The readability of the so cial and political game has become blurred. \nThese institutional transformations give the impres sion that everyone, even the most \nhumble and fragile must bear the burden of choosing  and deciding everything.  392   \n \nSimilarly, whereas the body long appeared to be a m atter of fate \u2013be it God- or Nature-given \nthus, to a large extent, monolithic and untouchable \u2013 the burden of (re-)designing it seems to \nhave befallen even the most humble and fragile of u s. 393     \n \nDon\u2019t you want a healthy body? \n \nIs there a new form of eugenics?

Far from it. The new eugenics is a \ncommercial eugenics. It is market steered. It is ba nal. It is friendly.

Because the return \non investment (ROI) is nothing short of remarkable.  For every dollar invested in \ncomprehensive prevention and health promotion progr ams, these companies are saving $3-8 \nin the form of reduced health costs and gains in pr oductivity from lower absenteeism and \npresenteeism. The key to the success of all these p rograms is their voluntary nature and the \nincentives built-in to the process to motivate empl oyees to become involved in changing \nlifestyle and becoming healthier. It should be made  clear that a prevention and health \npromotion initiative is not to be  regarded as a replacement for existing government h ealth \ncare coverage, but, rather, a complement, a way of assisting workers to become healthier \nand lead more productive and happier lives. 396  \n \n                                                 \n394  As quoted in German in der [im]perfekte mensch: vom recht auf unvollkommen heit , Ein Rundgang durch die \nAusstellung im Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin, s. l.:  Stiftung Deutsches Hygiene-Museum; Deutsche \nBehindertenhilfe \u2013 Aktion Mensch e.V., 2002, p. 116 : \u201eGibt es eine neue Form der Eugenik?

And \nmore clearly than the biotechnology quote, it clear ly emphasises the extremely attractive \nfinancial incentive for companies who decide to ado pt preventive measures for their \nemployees. 397  Strikingly, as we shall see in the course of this chapter, this wholesale, almost \nunquestioning embrace of fitness and wellness strat egies has become an increasingly \nmainstream attitude that has spread well beyond the  corporate world to include national as \nwell as international governmental policies not to mention an increasingly individualised \nappropriation. Thus, I did not select Rifkin\u2019s init ial statement because I intend to discuss \nbiotechnologies and/or the reproductive perspective s they offer. Instead, just as \nbiotechnologies hold the potential to customise the  \u201cdesign\u201d of babies, fitness and wellness \nare ideologies that may lead to the instrumentalisa tion of consumers\u2019 relationships with \ntheir bodies. 398  In other words, what I am particularly concerned a bout here is not eugenics \nin the historical sense but a new, no less potent f orm of lifestyle discrimination that operates \nboth in the professional and personal spheres. Comp ared to a long-term transgenerational  \nrace improvement project 399 , this form of lifestyle discrimination represents an \nintragenerationally  normative approach to health and beauty optimisati on, which pitches \ncontemporary bodies against each other \u2013in the spir it of \u201cthe self-actualisation of the \nfittest\u201d. Herv\u00e9 Juvin, a French economist and essay ist, aptly describes the transition between \nthese two paradigms:   \n \nMost people were intent upon \u201cleaving something beh ind\u201d. Today it is the contrary: my only \ntrue capital, my legacy, is my body, the time and t he experiences I am entitled to. Before, I \n                                                 \n397  Not so long ago, I discovered a good example of th is financial incentive during a short holiday in th e French-\nspeaking part of Switzerland. An article in a local  weekly entitled \u201cHow Micarna halved its absenteeis m\u201d details \nhow the meat-packing plant belonging to the largest  Swiss supermarket chain, Migros, managed to reduce  its \nrate of absenteeism from 8.5% to 3.9% by means of a  series of measures that can no doubt be ascribed t o a \nwellness ideology. The strategies embraced range fr om the reintroduction of gymnastics, to the financi al \nparticipation of the company in fitness club fees, free tea and fruit, table football in the group\u2019s c afeterias, job \nrotation to avoid monotony, not to mention a weekly  massage session. Moreover, when employees are ill,  \ntheir bosses must maintain regular contact and faci litate subsequent reinsertion. These efforts have e arned the \ncompany the privilege of being labeled \u201cFriendly Wo rk Space\u201d after having been hotly criticised in the  early \n2000s for offering particularly bad working conditi ons.  However, these measures are not just part of an image-\nrevamping strategy since every percent of absenteei sm avoided represents a saving of 2 million Swiss F rancs \nfor the company, with an ROI rate of approx. 1:3.

Today\u2019s fitness ideology is \ncharacterized by \u201cjoy through power\u201d, e.g., in body -building. People who do not fit the \ncurrent fitness and body ideals, that is being fit,  beautiful and muscular (muscular and thin \nfor females) become marginalized. They become secon d class citizens, whose \naccomplishments do not get the same recognition (e. g. being selected for a job) [...]. 401  \n \nThis state of affairs is particularly arresting in the U.S. where health insurance plans are \nusually private \u2013in contrast with Germany\u2019s still d ominant \u201cstatutory health insurance\u201d \n[gesetzliche Krankenversicherung] or the British \u201cN ational Health Service\u201d\u2013 and thus bound \nto corporate \u201cgoodwill\u201d.

In other words, I seek to investigate how, in contrast \nwith rabid nation-building political endeavours, th e pursuit of a certain brand of beauty and \nhealth is now increasingly perceived as a very posi tive individual investment \u2013and this \ndespite (or because of?) its being quietly steered and contained by globalised corporations \nand co-opted international institutions. 404  Thereby, I hope to demonstrate how fitness and \nwellness have enabled a cultural shift from commodi ties and services considered as tools \ntowards health prevention, promotion or enhancement  to HLTs that blur the boundaries \nbetween work and leisure.  \n \nFrom the Bikini Girls to Jane Fonda \nA preoccupation with a normatively harmonious and p roductive embodiment is clearly not \nthe exclusive preserve of our contemporary and/or w estern societies.

Obedience to these norms is rewarded b y the sense of belonging to a \u2018superior\u2019 group. \u2018Th e body\u2019 is \na value that simultaneously identifies one with a g roup while distinguishing him/her. This \u2018body\u2019 whic h is \nworked out, sculpted, chiseled, defined today const itutes a sign of a certain human virtue. Under the morality of \n\u2018good shape\u2019 and \u2018fitness,\u2019 working the body is an act pregnant with signification. \u2018The body,\u2019 more t han the \nclothes, becomes a symbol which consecrates and mak es visible differences among social groups. It embo dies \nand synthesizes three interrelated concepts: 1) the  body as an insignia (or emblem) of the effort each  one has \nmade to control, imprison, and domesticate the body  in order to achieve \u2018good shape\u2019; 2) the body as a  fashion \nicon (or brand), which symbolizes the superiority o f those who possess it; and 3) the body as a prize (medal), \ndeservedly earned by those who were able to achieve  a more \u2018civilized\u2019 physique through their hard wor k and \nsacrifice.\u201d Cf.

Bu t since my aims and my \nexpertise are mostly centred on the 20 th  century, I do not want to stretch either by going too \nfar back. However, at this point, it may be useful to remember that phenomena that appear \ncontemporary such as jogging, weight-lifting, stret ching, face masks, acupressure or \n(essential) oil massage, boast well-documented root s that stretch far back into Antiquity and \nbeyond, from e.g. Greek and Roman to Egyptian, Midd le-Eastern, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, \nMiddle- or South American civilisations to so-calle d \u201caboriginal\u201d societies all over the globe. \nParticularly striking illustrations for our modern sensibility are for instance some of the \u201cVilla \ndel Casale\u201d mosaics (dating back to ~300 AD) in Pia zza Armerina, Sicily. Among other \nrepresentations, the so-called \u201cRoom with Girls in Bikini\u201d displays a series of women clad in \nsexy bikinis and engaged in e.g. weight-lifting, di scus-throwing or running. Despite the fact \nthat the women\u2019s figures may not quite embody our c urrent perfectly streamlined slimness \nand fitness ideals, as heralded by the likes of Jan e Fonda in the 1980s, they nevertheless \nbear witness to the early intrusion of technology i n the actively conscious design of healthy, \nattractive and high-performance bodies.  406   \n \nAt the other end of the historical spectrum, Jane F onda, is a particularly emblematic figure \nfor the new generation of health entrepreneurs. If she was initially primarily known as an \nactress, top-model, and a political \u2013especially fem inist\u2013 activist, she also gained a non \nnegligible appeal as a fitness guru. The significan ce of the latter role increased to such an \nextent in the course of the 1980s that it almost ov ershadowed her other activities. 407  Her \npassion for aerobics, which she took up after havin g to give up ballet due to a foot injury, \nwas disseminated via a number of workout videos and  she shared her views on healthy \neating, health, relationships etc. through a number  of books. Indeed, to this day, her \nconfident self-entrepreneurship is reflected in the  store section of her official website \noffering products such as T-shirts, mugs, and fitne ss DVDs. 408   \n \nMarried to mechanics: a story of embodied seduction  and resistance  \n                                                 \n405  Cf. my discussion of Marcel Mauss in Chapter 3 ( Theory ).  \n406  For photographic reproductions or added explanatio ns and details, cf. e.g.: \nhttp://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Villa_Romana_Del_ Casale_Bikini_All_Girls.jpg  or \nhttp://whc.unesco.org/en/list/832  .

Exercise and fitness also provi ded a \nnon-political avenue of participation in the women\u2019 s movement, creating opportunities of (literal) \nempowerment, without the often complex identity of a politically active feminist.\u201d Cf. Maguire, Jennifer Smith, \nop. cit., p. 55. However, this form of empowerment should be critically assessed since just as other f itness \npractices, \u201caerobics is oriented towards the prevailing slende rness and beauty ideals and furthers a one-\ndimensional corporeality based on appearance\u201d  even if for women \u201c[a]erobics seems to definitely be a source of \nself-confidence and self-esteem\u201d .

[website accessed Aug. 2011] 114 \n \nSo what distinguishes early body-design endeavours from the ones propounded by e.g. Jane \nFonda in the fitness age? I would like to argue tha t a seminal influence in the philosophies \nunderlying appropriate body management is the histo rical transition from what one could \ndescribe as \u201cbodies using technology\u201d to \u201ctechnolog y using bodies\u201d, in other words the long-\ndrawn impact of the industrial revolution: \n \nFrom its very inception, the history of industrial societies was a history of the human body. \nFrom the early 19 th  century already, physicians, hygienists and social  reformers were well \naware of the impacts of modern \u201coccupations\u201d, indus trial work conditions and the process of \nurbanisation on the bodies of both workers and city  dwellers. 409  \n \nThe impact of the industrial revolution was not onl y felt on the shaping of the body at work \nor on bodies wending their way through urban landsc apes but it also crucially catalysed a \nmore precise delineation between work and leisure s ince leisure was conceptualised as the \nprivileged arena to recuperate from the strain and vicissitudes encountered both at work \nand in the city. As we shall see in the following s ections, the definition of the \u201cwork-leisure\u201d \ncounterpoint represents one of the greatest landmar ks in the development of our \ncontemporary understanding of well-being. As Kennet h Roberts puts it:  \n \nOur leisure is a product, first and foremost, of th e modern organization of work. Some work \nhas not been modernized; housework is an example. B ut in all modern societies work is \nordinarily taken to mean paid work, and most paid w ork is modernized, meaning here that it \nis compartmentalized and rationalized. 410  \n \nPrior to industrialisation, work in agrarian commun ities was primarily dominated by \nhusbandry and seasonal imperatives, and leisure was  not necessarily posed as the \ncounterpoint of work because the boundaries between  the two were much more fluid. Even \nin urban centres, work was not organised in order t o tightly espouse the rigours of the \nfactory clock and bodies were more likely to follow  the cycles dictated by the alternation of \nnight and day. But with the establishment of manufa cturing and its machines powered by \nseemingly endless energy resources, bodies had to t une into new rhythms. These rhythms \nwere no longer dictated by seasons, sunlight or its  absence but by increasingly swift and \nsophisticated technologies. Ever increasing product ivity and resistance to wear and tear thus \nbecame imperatives that human motors had to, perfor ce, be submitted to. 411   \n \n                                                 \n409  Physiologie und industrielle Gesellschaft: Studien zur Verwissenschaftlichung des K\u00f6rpers im 19. und 2 0. \nJahrhundert , op. cit., p. 12: \u201eDie Geschichte der Industriegesellschaft war von A nfang an eine Geschichte des \nmenschlichen K\u00f6rpers.

Some historians of housework may disagree with Roberts since there have \nbeen numerous attempts at compartmentalising and ra tionalising housework \u2013even if it remains largely \nunpaid. However, as Ruth Schwartz Cowan pointedly a nalyses it, these attempts have hardly contributed to \nlightening the burden of women and increasing their  free time \u2013quite the contrary. Cf. Cowan, Ruth Sch wartz, \nMore Work for Mother: The Ironies of Household Tech nology from the Open Hearth to the Microwave , New \nYork: Basic Books, 1983. Otherwise, for a nuanced d iscussion of the definitions and articulation of wo rk and \nleisure, cf. Fogel, Robert W., The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700-21 00 , Cambridge: Cambridge \nUniversity Press, 2004, pp. 67-74 \n411  Cf. e.g. Schor, Juliet B., The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure , New York: Basic \nBooks, 1992, esp. Chapter 3 \u201c\u2018A Life at Hard Labor\u2019 : Capitalism and Working Hours\u201d. 115 \n \nThe discovery of the thermodynamic laws not only sp elt out the potential and limits of \nmechanical power deployment, it also fostered the e mergence of new professions \u2013 such as \nphysiologists, work scientists and nutritionists \u2013 geared towards the efficient management of \nthe modern body. These professions attempted to tra nsfer the model of energy \nconservation found in nature to bodies employed in the industry. Simultaneously, they tried \nto fight entropy by formulating and actively suppor ting measures against fatigue, e.g. \nthrough the optimisation of work ergonomics, the re duction of working hours, the \ndetermination of adequate calorie intake, etc. But fatigue proved a permanent challenge \nsince the entropy of bodies seemed much more diffic ult to overcome than that of machines. \nSomehow, the \u201cnatural body\u201d refused to be reduced t o an \u201cindustrial body-motor\u201d. 412  In \nparallel, from the mid-nineteenth century onwards, increased industrialisation spawned a \nwealth of mechanistic metaphors to illuminate the b ody and its metabolism as well as \nspecific machines to design and regenerate bodies:   \n \n[\u2026] descriptions of the body as machine are not mer ely evidence of industrial strategies to \nincrease worker productivity. They also indicate th at individuals desired greater control over \ntheir bodies, over the way they performed, the way they looked, and the rate at which they \ndecayed than any previous generation. For those on and off the assembly lines, mechanized \nphysical metaphors could represent a desire to craf t bodies into entities as powerful as \nmachines. This possibility allows for a cultural co ntext in which machines became agents for \nphysical vigor and weapons against the threat of te rminal fatigue. 413  \n  \nTo some extent then, popular enthusiasm for fit bod ies matched scientific and managerial \ninterest but all were premised upon the recognition  that industrial lifestyles were draining \nand required some form of compensatory input, wheth er under the guise of machines, \nelectricity or radium. Indeed, the late 19 th and early 20 th  centuries brought forth a surge of \nelectro-mechanical appliances meant to relax, tone,  stimulate, style or energise the body. 414  \nThese were eagerly consumed in private homes and/or  used in spas and gyms by men \u2013and \nto some extent women\u2013 across classes, both in Europ e and the U.S. The commercial success \nof these health gadgets reflected a belief, or perh aps more accurately a need to believe, that \nthe awe-inspiring forces what powered modern life c ould also be harnessed to unblock, \ntransfer and even create energy in the body. 415  This is perhaps the first instance of the \n                                                 \n412  Cf. e.g. Rabinbach, Anson, The Human Motor , New York: Basic Books, 1990; Sarasin, Philipp, op . cit. & \nPhysiologie und Industrielle Gesellschaft : Studien zur Verwissenschaftlichung des K\u00f6rpers im 1 9. und 20. \nJahrhundert , op. cit. However even today, in the realm of prof essional and extreme sports, the utopia of \novercoming bodily limits remains alive and well, cf . e.g. Hoberman, John, Sterbliche Maschinen.

In \ntheir own specific ways, these ideologies contribut ed to setting the scene for an increased \nreceptiveness to the needs of a \u201cnaturally\u201d embodie d consciousness, a consciousness poised \nto become much more mainstream towards the end of t he 20 th  century. Indeed, a closer \nexamination of the Kaiserreich and Weimar periods i n Germany reveals that many of the \nmotives leading people to increased concern about t heir health are strikingly similar to our \ncontemporary worries: a strong reaction against inc reased urbanisation and industrialisation \n(and conversely, the feeling of being alienated fro m nature), sedentary jobs, chronic \n\u201ccivilisation\u201d diseases, and \u2013most interestingly of  all\u2013 stress, which tended to be labelled as \n\u201cnervous disorders\u201d (including \u201cmelancholia\u201d, \u201chyst eria\u201d or \u201cneurasthenia\u201d). Subsumed \nunder the latter were anxieties of performance, bot h bodily and mental, which were \nrepeatedly invoked as powerful motivations to seek \u201cnatural\u201d cures. 416  In turn, these \nanxieties of performance were strongly shaped by a discourse enshrining a new morality of \n                                                 \n416  There is a wealth of excellent literature on the v arious reactions to \u201cbody mechanisation\u201d.

For the American context: c.f. e.g. Green, Harvey, Fit for America: health, \nfitness, sport and American society , Baltimore & London: Johns Hopkins University Pres s, 1986, or Fitness in \nAmerican culture: images of health, sport, and the body, 1830 \u2013 1940 , op. cit. These two volumes provide a \nwelcome counterpoint to the German histories quoted , since while highlighting the specificities of the  \nAmerican context in terms of politics, medicine or religion, they present the reader with innumerable parallels \nbetween American and German \u2013or more broadly Europe an\u2013 health trajectories.   117 \n \nhealth: a personal and increasingly national or rac ial responsibility to cultivate health along \nstrictly normalised lines separating the pathologic al (or degenerate) from the wholesome.  \n \nIn parallel with these relatively mainstream moveme nts, all of which developed influential \nideas about the importance of both physical and men tal fitness as well as nutritional hygiene \nwhile reinstating the body as a central locus for h uman well-being and development, a \nnumber of more isolated (and often eccentric) movem ents and individuals attempted to \npreach a redemptive gospel that more explicitly fed  off the frustrations linked to the \nindustrial age. Nevertheless, even these more margi nal proponents did not necessarily or \ncompletely sever ties with the scientific \u201cperforma nce\u201d ideologies permeating the age, since \nmany of them were inextricably entangled in the new  professions I mentioned above. \nProminent examples include e.g. Dr Maximilian Birch er\u2013Benner 417  and Dr Rudolf Steiner 418  in \nthe German-speaking realm, or Sylvester Graham 419  and Dr John Harvey Kellogg 420  in the U.S. \nMaximilian Bircher-Benner is a particularly emblema tic example of this curious blend \nbetween a modern scientific affiliation and a more esoterically \u201cnatural\u201d orientation. The \nonline Swiss Historical Lexicon provides this telli ng summary of his professional career: \n \nB. first practised general medicine in Aussersihl. After a decisive experience that convinced \nhim of the therapeutic value of a vegetarian diet i n 1895, he founded a private clinic in Zurich \nthat was specialised in dietetics and naturopathic healing. From around 1900, based on the \nnotion of entropy as borrowed from thermodynamics, he attempted to found a new global \ndietetics and divided foods into three categories a ccording to how much \u201dlive solar energy\u201d \nthey contained. In 1904, he founded the Lebendige K raft (\u201dliving force\u201d) sanatorium on the \nZ\u00fcrichberg, an establishment that met with internat ional recognition. B.\u2019s hygiene was \nconceived as both preventive and curative and tende d towards inner harmony while \nencompassing all areas of everyday life. Moreover, the link between body and soul was \n                                                 \n417  [1867\u20131939, Switzerland & Germany], the \u201cinventor\u201d  (or \u201cadapter\u201d since he was apparently fed a simila r \ndish while hiking in the Swiss mountains) of the fa mous Bircherm\u00fcesli (nowadays, the industrially proc essed \nversion of this dish is more soberly known as \u201cmues li\u201d) and a promoter of vegetarian/wholefoods diets.

However, what \nthe Lexicon quote does not highlight is the fact th at, even if they do not articulate an \nexplicitly eugenic programme (as in e.g. John Harve y Kellog\u2019s legacy), Bircher-Benner\u2019s \ntheories nevertheless share the contemporary preocc upation with individual and national \n\u201cdegeneration\u201d [ Entartung ], understood as an almost inevitable by-product of  heightened \nindustrialisation. 424    \n \nMany of these personalities and the following they generated gradually gained larger \naudiences in the course of the 20 th  century. A common denominator was to conceive of a  \nbody that went beyond a purely mechanistic vision t o include emotions, as well as the \nmental and spiritual dimensions of embodiment. Thes e three realms could hardly be \naccounted for in the modern factory or office envir onment, where \u2013linked to the diktats of \n                                                 \n421  Swiss Historical Lexicon, op. cit. : \u00abB. pratiqua d'abord la m\u00e9decine g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 Aussers ihl.

The essence of these movements can thus be  seen as an attempt to re-access a sort \nof \u201cprelapsarian\u201d state of natural holistic health,  mostly in reaction to what was construed as \nthe artificiality of industrially or technically de termined lifestyles.425  As a recurring motif, it \ndominated alternative health theories of the late 1 9 th  century, but after WWI, it became \nincreasingly influential in a much vaster popular r ealm. This weltanschauung often indicted \nmodern science\u2019s role in the dissolution of traditi onal values:  \n \nScience had declared humanity\u2019s life and soul a sen seless product of mechanism so people \nnow treated one another as mere machines. It was sa id that the spread of mechanistic, \ninstrumentalist thinking into all areas of professi onal and cultural life had given rise to a \ncynical, this-worldly attitude and a decline in mor ality and idealism. Traditional ideals of \nlearning and culture were in crisis, the young peop le were alienated, and the arts had \ndegenerated into exercises in absurdity and self-ab sorption. The nihilistic message of \nscientists who apparently valued Technik over soul and integrity was even blamed for the \ndevastation of the lost war [...]. 426  \n  \nThis disenchantment resurfaced cyclically in the co urse of the 20 th  century. Early roots can \nbe perceived all the way back to 19th century syndi calism and the (proto-)fascist movements \nof the first half of the 20th before culminating in  the sweeping social movements of the \n1960s-70s embracing very diverse but often interloc king causes such as civil rights, \nlibertarian ideologies, feminism, ecology or even N ew Age spirituality. These successive and \nsometimes parallel movements often championed one o f the two following perspectives. \nEither they openly pitted technology and the indust ries producing them against an unspoiled \nprimeval nature that had to be regained by returnin g to a lifestyle devoid of the artificial \nintrusions of modernity \u2013in sum, a type of Thoreaui an ethic\u2013 or they left unexplained and \nunresolved the tensions between the imperatives of a modern, productive and efficient \nlifestyle and a model of untainted natural living s een as a regenerative refuge and the \nepitome of an economically and ecologically sustain able lifestyle. Perhaps because it is \ncharacterised by a more entrepreneurial spirit, the  latter ambivalent position seems to have \nleft us with a more lasting if ambivalent legacy. I ndeed, secluded and exclusive health farms \nand spas or Ayurvedic resorts (as the late modern o ffshoots of health clinics and sanatoria) \nhave met with a surprising revival in the past coup le of decades \u2013not least because they \noffer the illusion of a low-tech or \u201cfriendly-tech\u201d  refuge against contemporary stress and \nburnout. But in parallel, other \u201cnatural\u201d products such as Graham crackers, cornflakes or \nmuesli owe their enduring mass appeal to intensive industrial production and distribution. \nThese developments point to what can either be read  as an irreducible ambivalence in the \n                                                 \n425  Maren M\u00f6hring aptly analyses this ambiguous proces s she labels as the \u201eVer(natur)wissenschaftlichung des \nK\u00f6rpers\u201c [\u201cre(natural)scientisation of the body\u201d, a  concept that is difficult to translate: it aims to  encapsulate \nboth the increasingly scientific and naturalistic p erceptions of the body while playing on the German word \n\u201cNaturwissenschaft\u201d]. Concretely, she witnesses how  nudist discourse (her main focus) uncomfortably \nnegotiates the transition between a natural philoso phy [Naturphilosophie] and the natural sciences \n[Naturwissenschaft]. On the one hand, because natur al instinct is deemed lost, the backing of the natu ral \nsciences is legitimised in the search for or redisc overy of natural laws \u2013hence as a tool to appropria tely regulate \nthe use of natural health techniques. But on the ot her hand, the discourse on nudism also vehemently \ndenounces the excesses of science especially in ter ms of its absolutism and claims towards exclusive e xpertise. \nCf.

From the mid-19 th  century onwards, \nnutrition, movement, cosmetics and alternative heal th practices were increasingly utilised \nwith the aim of consciously enhancing the performan ce and aesthetics as well as the well-\nbeing of bodies. This shift was heralded by e.g. th e coexistent interpretations of whole grain \nbread as a complex carbohydrate and mineral conglom erate (providing useful calories and \nmicro-nutrients) and as a \u201cquintessence of life-giv ing solar energy\u201d. Moreover, both \nindustrial and natural factions \u2013however grudgingly  for the former\u2013 came to admit that \nbodies\u2019 optimal functioning could only be obtained through the alternation between work \n(or careful training and monitoring) and play (or c ycles of rest and regeneration).  \n \nFrom the design of physics to the aesthetics of the  physique \nIn the course of the 20 th  century and especially from what is sometimes desc ribed as the 3 rd  \nindustrial revolution (i.e. the generalised introdu ction of computer-steered command and \ncommunication systems from the early 1970s onwards) , the increased automation of factory \nand office processes implied that bodies could be i ncreasingly dispensed with. However, the \nsubsequent emergence of the so-called service econo my and its heavy computer reliance \ndemonstrated that, if many bodies were no longer pu t under the strain of matching the \nspeed of a conveyor belt or of massive repetitive s tress injury due to dangerous and \nmonotonous movements, they were nevertheless presen ted with another insidious \nchallenge. This challenge was sedentariness and its  cohort of attendants, the so-called \n\u201clifestyle\u201d or \u201ccivilisation\u201d diseases such as high  blood pressure, diabetes, osteoporosis, \nobesity, etc. 428  Additionally, the gradual but increasingly ubiquit ous dissemination of \ntelevision, video games and the Internet as dominan t and static leisure practices in \nwesternised economies reinforced the urgency of ret hinking the design of healthy bodies. \nThe gradual demise of bodies designed first by agri cultural then industrial practices \u2013\nwhether these were conceived as healthy or deformin g\u2013 thus left the late modern body a \nprey to a painful type of superfluity and formlessn ess. 429  A redefinition of the value of \nembodiment was therefore required:  \n \nBecause nowadays their physical performance hardly plays a role in paid employment any \nlonger, bodies must now be designed with an orienta tion towards particular uses and \nvalorisations. In this process, thermodynamics give s way to semiotics as a role-model \n                                                 \n427  I have already discussed the nature-culture or nat ure-technology divide at length in Chapter 3 ( Theory ), \nespecially in the \u201cUnder the sign of the body\u201d and \u201cTechnology\u201d sections, and discuss it more concrete ly in my \ncase-studies, especially in Chapter 6 ( Cosmetics case-study ).  \n428  Cf. my discussion of these diseases in Chapter 3 ( Theory ), \u201cEmbodied Consciousness\u201d section.   \n429  Cf. Penz, Otto, \u201eFit for the Looks: Heavenly Bodie s\u201c, Fitness as cultural phenomenon , op. cit., p. 34: \u201cUnder \npostindustrial conditions we encounter two paradoxe s. Firstly, the less we need the body in terms of s trength \nand endurance at the work place the more people are  concerned with their fitness.  [...] Secondly, the  more \nWestern societies are ageing the stronger becomes t he emphasis on a youthful appearance.\u201d 121 \n \ndiscipline. The technologisation of the body in the  20th and 21st centuries thereby neatly fits \ninto the technologisation strategies characteristic ally implemented for inert products. 430  \n \nIn this vision then, the long-drawn design battle o ver the importance of function versus form \nloses much of its impetus. Once function no longer really fosters distinction and/or \ndiscrimination, form (or aesthetics) and especially  subjective well-being can also become \ncentral driving forces behind the technological man agement of the body. Thus, provided one \ncan count on an initially healthy constitution, ade quate financial resources, motivation, \nwillpower, etc., the apparent uselessness of the bo dy is gradually transformed into a huge \nfield of self-actualisation possibilities. However,  the formability of the body \u2013but also its \nfrequent resistance to moulding\u2013 coupled with the a rray of choices available, has \nprecipitated the need for new types of guidance sin ce bodily boundaries have become \ncontested. Indeed, bodies are increasingly viewed a s nomadic \u2013straddling a number of \nparallel realms\u2013 and the negotiation of personal bo dily space therefore becomes an urgent \nexistential pursuit. According to the geographer Gi ll Valentine:  \n \nAn individual may experience multi-faceted, overlap ping, and fluid understandings of how \nthey should be producing and regulating the space o f their body which may not be \ncompletely congruent or consistent, and sets up ten sions and conflict between different \nbodily ideals and sets of regulatory practices in d ifferent locations. 431    \n \nIn fact, as Harvie Ferguson aptly describes it, con temporary body space goes well beyond the \nnarrow shape or size of the body:  \n \nThe classical body image may be thought of as shrin k-wrapped to the surface of the material \nbody, while the contemporary body image is much mor e loosely related to its corporeal \nform. This is now a quite familiar feature of every day life. We frequently refer to our \n\u201cpersonal space,\u201d which is both more extended and m ore variable that the severely localized \nspace of bodily experience established during the c lassical period of Modernity. The \nautomobile, for example, further extended this spac e, while the telephone and new \nelectronic media of communication do so with at pre sent incalculable effects. 432  \n \nWhat is at stake here is the establishment of a mic rocosm, what one could define as a \nmaterial and symbolic body ecology.

[websites accessed Aug. 2011] \n434  As already hinted at in this chapter and in Chapte r 2 ( Methodology ), the roots of our contemporary fitness \nethic go way back to the 19 th  century and even beyond to\u2026 Antiquity. As Muriel G illick puts it: \u201cIndividual \nresponsibility for health through clean and upright  living \u2013 eating right, exercising, and abstaining from drink \u2013 \nis part of a venerable American tradition. The fund amental tenet of this tradition of physical hygieni sm, dating \nat least to John Wesley (whose Primitive Physick, p ublished in 1764, regarded sickness as punishment f or earthly \nsins), is that health results from living in accord  with \u2018the laws of nature.\u2019 And, most hygienists ha ve argued, \nsince the laws of nature are God-given, it is a rel igious obligation to abide by them.\u201d  Cf. Gillick, Muriel R., \n\u201cHealth Promotion, Jogging, and the Pursuit of the Moral Life \u201d, Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law , 9, \n1984, pp. 369-387, p. 369. And fitness in the sense  of \u201cappropriate\u201d or \u201csuitable\u201d actually dates back  to the late \n16 th  century. For a comprehensive overview of definitio ns, cf. e.g. Webster\u2019s Online Dictionary \n(http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitio ns/fitness?cx=partner-pub-\n0939450753529744%3Av0qd01-tdlq&cof=FORID%3A9&ie=UTF -8&q=fitness&sa=Search#922 ). For a good \nsummary, cf. also Maguire, Jennifer Smith, op. cit. , p. 2: \u201cDefinitions of fitness also vary across time. Diff erent \naspects of bodies and selves have been problematize d and valorized over time \u2013 character, attractivene ss, \nhappiness, strength, morality, intelligence, courag e, honesty \u2013  and these changing bodily priorities reflect \nchanging societal conditions.\u201d  Furthermore: \u201cThe lived definition of fitness is not clear-cut. It involves feelings of \ncapacity, notions of control (over ourselves; over how others see us), and understanding of societal n orms and \nexpectations, be they articulated in advertising an d the media in terms of beauty and youth, or in med ical and \ngovernment documents in terms of risk and health. F itness is a complex concept, its criteria and objec tives \nvarying within and between individuals.\u201d  Cf. ibid., p. 2.

Cooper\u2019 s new aerobics 437  gospel, which was \nlaunched in 1968: \n \nCooper advocated a philosophy that shifted away fro m disease treatment to one of disease \nprevention. \u2018It is easier to maintain good health t hrough proper exercise, diet, and emotional \nbalance than it is to regain it once it is lost\u2019 he  said. Early in his career, Cooper stressed the \nnecessity for providing epidemiological data to sup port the benefits of regular exercise and \nhealth. 438   \n \nFitness then was very much grounded in the preoccup ation with the ills of sedentariness and \nthe ensuing trends of preventive medicine. 439  However, the breakthrough of Cooper\u2019s \naerobic philosophy  in Europe, as one of the core c omponents of active fitness, took place \nalmost two decades after its American launch \u2013that is towards the early to mid-1980s. 440  \nFrom then on in Europe, the use of \u201cfitness\u201d as a t erm extended beyond describing an \noptimal state of bodily performance to include a se t of ideas, practices and products geared \ntowards the attainment of this state. Concretely, f itness was especially anchored in the \nmovement practices \u2013 such as aerobics gymnastics an d weight training \u2013 promoted by so-\ncalled \u201cfitness clubs\u201d, \u201cfitness studios\u201d and speci alised gyms that mushroomed all over \n                                                 \n435  Cf.

Furthermore, women gained \nincreased access and soon became lead consumers in the field, due to the impulse of \nprominent ambassadors of aerobics gymnastics such a s the actresses Jane Fonda in the U.S \nor Sydne Rome in Europe. 441  Over time, the age range of practitioners also gre w to include \nteenagers and more mature consumers, there again un der the impulse of various show-\nbusiness and sports celebrities. 442   \n \nIn terms of the actual practice of fitness discipli nes, a strong emphasis was laid on the \nimportance of cardio-vascular training: that is inc reasing the heart rate at regular intervals in \norder to compensate for the risks linked to static professional activities. 443  This was achieved \nby performing rapid workouts in- or out-of-doors \u2013w ith or without weights, machines and \nother accessories\u2013 involving the various muscle gro ups of the body. 444  Paradoxically:  \n \nThe point of fitness training is to improve the bod y, with help from its own exertions, to go \nfar beyond its normal abilities. The body\u2019s product ion of muscle, red blood cells, nerve paths, \nblood vessels, etc. is so optimized that nature is outwitted by nature itself; thus nature \ndevelops abilities that far exceed what is necessar y to survive. 445   \n \nWhen performed indoors, the environment was designe d to resemble a dance studio \n(usually also involving a loud musical accompanimen t), with hardwood, plastic or rubber \nfloors and largely mirrored surfaces, enabling part icipants to both follow the choreography \nof the fitness trainer and monitor the progress of their own movements and postures over \ntime \u2013 not to mention the comparison of body shapes . 446  The promise of an ideally shaped, \n                                                 \n441  Cf. e.g. \u201cJane Fonda\u2019s Workout Record\u201d released in  1982 ( http://www.discogs.com/Various-Jane-Fondas-\nWorkout-Record/release/842499 ) or Sydne Rome\u2019s LP released in 1983 and entitled \u201cSydne Rome Aerobic \nFitness Dancing\u201d ( http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=1850862 ). The fact that two main \nambassadors of the aerobics wave belonged to the sh ow-business arena may signal an interesting shift f rom \noverwhelmingly medical (or more generally academic)  expertise (e.g. the aforementioned Dr. Cooper) to a \nmore popular type of proficiency. I already alluded  to this shift in the \u201cCommodification\u201d and \u201cEmbodi ed \nConsciousness\u201d sections in Chapter 3 ( Theory ), when discussing the \u201crecombinance\u201d metaphor and the \ndemocratisation of expertise enabled by the concept  of \u201cembodied subjectivity\u201d.

He is act ually often credited as the \u201cfounder of the modern physical \nfitness movement\u201d since in 1936 already, he launche d a combination business including a gym, a juice b ar and \na health food store in Oakland. Cf.  http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/sports/24lalanne. html  & \nhttp://www.jacklalanne.com/jacks-adventures/index.p hp . From 1951, he also hosted a hugely popular fitnes s \ntelevision show, long before the likes of Jane Fond a or Arnold Schwarzenegger dominated the mediated f itness \nfield, a good example can be found here: http://www.jacklalanne.com/watch-jack/ . Interestingly, both he and \nhis wife reported a sort of health epiphany \u2013involv ing a conversion to more movement and better nutrit ion\u2013 of \nthe type mentioned at the beginning of this chapter , cf. http://www.jacklalanne.com/jacks-adventures/elaine-\nlalanne.php  [websites accessed Aug. 2011] \n445  Cf. Gebauer, Gunther, op. cit., p. 84. \n446  It should be emphasised that like prior holistic b ody movements, fitness practices more or less expli citly \nstrive to reconcile a normalised aesthetic and anat omical view of the body with what can be described as \nphysiological or functional normalcy/health, even i f the former is usually subordinated to the attainm ent of the \nlatter. 125 \n \ntoned and resilient body (such as the ones displaye d by Jane Fonda or Arnold \nSchwarzenegger) drove many fitness adepts to perman ent injuries, due e.g. to the repeated \nimpact of badly designed shoes on a hard surface an d routines that were simply too taxing \u2013\nnot to mention the ingestion of steroids and other doping substances. Some individuals even \nmet with a premature death linked to an overstraini ng of the heart. 447  Over time, these \nshocking developments spurred on the shift from so- called high-impact to low-impact \naerobics or, more generally softer fitness routines . It also opened up the stage for \nincreasingly stringent health guidelines or regulat ions, more serious professional training of \nfitness staff as well as the recourse to less viole nt or strenuous disciplines such as stretching, \ntai chi chuan and yoga and regenerative body practi ces like sauna, massage, guided \nrelaxation, etc.   \n \nBesides indoor fitness, another prominent aerobic d iscipline proved to be jogging. \nProfessional coaches Arthur Lydiard [1917-2004] fro m New Zealand 448  and Bill Bowerman \n[1911-1999] from the U.S. 449   are often credited for motivating early sporting enthusiasts to \nrun. However, as another interesting example of the  cross-cultural fertilisation I mentioned \nin Chapter 2 ( Methodology ), as early as 1955, a prominent German physician, Dr Ernst van \nAaken [1910-1984] had already started theorising th e benefits of long-distance running and \nopenly promoting it for all (including women and ch ildren). 450  As the trainer of Herbert \nSteffny, 451  who was to become a prominent runner, running coac h (of e.g. Joschka Fischer \nwhom I mentioned earlier on) and running magazine e ditor, 452  van Aaken contributed in no \nsmall measure to the jogging boom in Germany. But t he movement only truly became \npopular in the course of the 1970s \u2013be it in German y or the U.S. A landmark in jogging\u2019s \ndissemination proved to be the publication of \u201cThe Complete Book of Running\u201d  by Jim Fixx \n[1932-1984], a journalist whose enthusiasm for runn ing led him to quit smoking and lose 30 \nkg \u2013but did not stop him from dying at the age of 5 4. 453  Dr George Sheehan [1918-1993] is \nalso often quoted as a major inspiration both pract ically \u2013he took up running at 45 and \nobtained very impressive results by the time he was  50\u2013 and theoretically, as a columnist for \na local paper before becoming the medical adviser f or Runner\u2019s World , one of the most \n                                                 \n447  Cf. e.g. Department of Kinesiology and Health, Geo rgia State University, \u201cHigh Impact Aerobics\u201d, The \nExercise and Physical Fitness Page , online resource, last modified 10.10.1997:  \nhttp://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwfit/aerobicd.html#Low-Impac t . Jogging should also be mentioned in this \nconnection since the jogging boom took off in Europ e roughly during the same period. The rationales \nunderlying its eager adoption were similar to those  governing aerobics and, in its infancy, it was pla gued by \nsimilar excesses. Cf. e.g. Louie, Elaine, \u201cAT WORK WITH: Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper; The Fit Commandment\u201d, New \nYork Times , July 12 th , 1995, available online: \nhttp://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=heal th&res=990CE4DB1139F931A25754C0A963958260 . This \narticle interestingly stresses a shift in Cooper\u2019s philosophy over time towards a more gentle definiti on of health \nthat no longer necessarily implies aerobic fitness:  \u201cIn the 1980's, he began to question the benefits o f intensive \ntraining, in part because in 1984, his friend Jim F ixx, author of \"The Complete Book of Running\" and a  \nmarathoner, died of a heart attack. In 1990, Dr. Co oper saw a study of the 2,300 runners in the 1987 L os \nAngeles Marathon indicating that 40 percent had a c old or the flu during the two months preceding the race. In \n1989, the Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research re leased its own study that showed that people could be \nhealthy without being aerobically fit.\u201d  [websites accessed Aug. 2011] \n448  Cf.

According to her analysis, however, it was  not the medical aspect that proved most \ndecisive for jogging\u2019s popular take-off. 457  Indeed, in parallel with budding medical interest in \nthe discipline, popular enthusiasm was already ther e in the 1960s, particularly in the upper-\nmiddle class. Typically, middle-aged politicians an d executives took up the practice in the \nwake of a sort of \u201cmid-life crisis\u201d (although Gilli ck does not use the term herself), when they \nrealised that they had unhealthy lifestyles involvi ng smoking, high cholesterol & overweight. \nJogging thus became a form of salvation, an insuran ce of sorts against heart attacks, even \nbefore conclusive medical evidence was truly provid ed in medical journals. This perception \nwas upheld by articles in a number of popular magaz ines such as NYT Magazine , Newsweek , \nTime , etc.  \n \nHowever, Gillick also indicted disenchantment with political, social and economic conditions \nin the U.S.  as a main reason for the soaring popul arity of fitness: \u201cThe collapse of the liberal \nconsensus \u2013 the belief that the strength and virtue  of America had created peace abroad and \nharmony at home \u2013 coming on top of a shattered fait h that American medicine could render \nthe world safe from disease, led to the view that A merica was morally sick, in need of \nspiritual renewal.\u201d 458   Thus \u201c[...] if there is a single, unifying theme underly ing the popularity \nof running in both the sixties and the seventies, i t is the appeal of the venerable notion of \nupright living as a means to personal and social re newal.\u201d 459  \u2013echoing in this the \nadmonitions to be found in the writings of 19 th  century hygienists and eugenists. Before \nlong, the practice of jogging experienced a demogra phic diversification: many more women \nand young people joined the craze but exercise stil l positively associated with income. \nOtherwise, the focus broadened from heart disease p revention to the effects of jogging on \nwell-being as a whole and even on the mind. Its mas s appeal 460  was further strengthened by \nthe media, marketing, equipment, sporting events, t he enrolment of athletes for promotion, \netc.  \n                                                 \n454  Cf. http://www.georgesheehan.com/welcome/bio.html .

Conrad, Peter, \u201c Wellness as Virtue: Morality and the Pursuit of Hea lth\u201d, \nCulture Medicine and Psychiatry , Vol. 18, No 3, 1994, pp. 385-401, p. 386: \u201cWhile nutrition is a long-time health \nconcern, and cholesterol and fat have been implicat ed by medical evidence as risk factors for heart di sease \n(USDHHS 1991), the emergence of \u2018natural foods,\u2019 \u2018h ealth foods,\u2019 and endless \u2018lite\u2019 preparations has o utpaced \nthe scientific evidence, less reflecting scientific  findings, than a cultural interest in more \u2018natura l\u2019 foods, and new \ncorporate strategies for marketing food products. T he important point here is that neither scientific medical \nfindings nor government reports on health promotion  are sufficient to explain the emergence of the bro ad-\nbased interest and participation in wellness-orient ed activities.\u201d    \n458  Ibid., p. 375. \n459  Ibid., p. 371. \n460  There were approx. 30 million joggers in the U.S. when Gillick wrote her paper [1984], cf. ibid. p. 3 83. 127 \n \n \nOver time, fitness \u2013in its various incarnations\u2013 st arted to colonise an increasing number of \neveryday life realms. Brian Pronger aptly sums up t he amazing contemporary breadth of the \nfitness constellation in both its material and serv ice expressions:  \n \nThe technology of physical fitness circulates in a consumer economy of goods and services. \nServices include membership in fitness and sports c lubs and centres, which offer fitness \nappraisal and exercise prescription, exercise equip ment and space, instruction, personal \ntrainers, various aerobic exercise classes, massage , change rooms, showers as well as goods. \nGoods include exercise equipment, clothing, special  foods, dietary supplements, therapeutic \ntechnologies, cosmetics, and body monitoring equipm ent such as weigh-scales, heart \nmonitors, and fat callipers. 461  \n \nIn sum, fitness seems to have evolved from panic-in duced and government-impelled \ncontrolling measures to counter the apparent physio logical decay engendered by post-\nindustrial lifestyles into much more subtly interna lised disciplines \u2013alternating effort/work \nand regeneration/play. As Jennifer Maguire sums it up:  \n \n[...] the fitness field illustrates the intended an d unintended consequences of the body\u2019s \nplace as a status object in contemporary consumer c ulture, in which occupation is privileged \nover recreation, form over function, and control ov er enjoyment. That is, for bodies that are \nfit for consumption, leisure is work, health is an appearance, and pleasure lies in discipline.  \n462    \n \nWhat Pronger\u2019s and Maguire\u2019s otherwise pertinent an alyses fail to recapture is the fact that \nfitness permeates a much wider realm of everyday li fe \u2013including nutrition, cosmetics and \nalternative health practices\u2013 that is increasingly independent of the mediation provided by \nfitness clubs or gyms. Moreover, they do not emphas ise the ideological cross-fertilisation \nbetween fitness in the leisure realm and fitness in  the work or corporate sphere. 463  Indeed \nthe latter aspect has a huge impact on the percepti on of body work and body leisure. In the \nfollowing section, I examine it more closely under the wellness lens but my conclusions \nwould be similar for corporate fitness. 464   \n                                                 \n461  Pronger, Brian, op. cit., p. 138.

However , in her introduction she also stresses that fitnes s is not a \nstatic constellation of imperatives but a dynamic f ield fostering navigation, negotiation, resistance and \ncompliance, cf. ibid. p. 3. \n463  Although she does frame the paradox of work within  leisure: \u201cThus, the cultural imaginary of leisure as a \ntime of freedom from  work and responsibility is accompanied by a parall el construction of leisure as a time of \nfreedom to  take up the work and responsibility of self-produc tion.\u201d  Cf. ibid., p. 193. [emphasis in original] \nGlassner, however, considers both aspects. Cf. Glas sner, Barry, \u201cFitness and the Postmodern Self\u201d, op.  cit., p. \n187. Gebauer frames it yet differently: \u201c[...]fitness sport is no longer an independent soc ial arena with its own \nprivileges and overarching class differences; rathe r, it extends the features acquired in the serious domain of \nsociety, e.g., work, into the domain of the non-ser ious (leisure time)\u201d . Cf. Gebauer, Gunther, op. cit., p. 89. \nPersonally, however, I would argue that the distinc tion between serious and non-serious is no longer t enable in \na fit world, since the performance ethic seamlessly  binds work with leisure \u2013in terms of both fluid bo undaries \nand the strict organisation of processes/training.  \n464  From a European perspective that (at least initial ly) starkly differentiates between fitness and well ness, it \nmay appear confusing to find out that, in the Ameri can \u201ccorporate health\u201d sphere, the terms fitness an d 128 \n \n \nWellness: buying into well-being? \nFollowing a similar path to that of fitness, the se eds of wellness had already been planted in \nthe U.S. by the late 1950s-early 1960s. Dr Halbert Dunn had then defined \u201cHigh-Level \nwellness\u201d  as \u201can integrated method of functioning which is orien ted towards maximizing the \npotential of which the individual is capable. It re quires that the individual maintain a \ncontinuum of balance and purposeful direction withi n the environment where he is \nfunctioning\u201d .465  Despite its attention to \u201cenvironment\u201d, the discou rse is still definitely \nperformance-oriented (if not blatantly mechanistic)  with its emphasis on \u201cfunctioning\u201d, \n\u201cmaximizing the potential\u201d, \u201cmaintaining a continuu m of balance\u201d and \u201cpurposeful \ndirection\u201d. The coalescing of wellness ideas into i nstitutionalised forms nevertheless took \ntime even in the U.S. 466  As Jacqueline Hart perceives it, the debate around  wellness issues \nreally crystallised in the 1970s around two seeming ly contradictory movements: \u201cthe \nmedicalization and demedicalization of American soc iety\u201d .467  The latter seems to have been \nmainly spearheaded by civil rights and feminist mov ements, as a reaction towards what they \nperceived as the excessive biomedical control over social problems. 468  As Hart puts it: \u201c[\u2026] \nproponents of demedicalization typically view the p atient as a health care consumer, an  \nindividual who might consult with the medical profe ssion, but ultimately has sufficient \nknowledge to make informed decisions about their ow n care.\u201d 469  Medicalisation on the other \nhand, can be described as the recuperation of demed icalisation by the medical profession in \nthe setting of public health goals with the strong backing of the state and the industry. These \ngoals thus reoriented the profession towards preven tive and psychosomatic medicine, whilst \nlegitimising the perspective whereby individuals ar e fully accountable for their own health: \n  \nThe second half of the twentieth century, then, wit nessed a return to the more traditional \nnineteenth-century public health approaches with co ncerns about structure, environment, \nand ecology, which rather ironically, became known again as \u2018the new public health\u2019. A \n                                                                                                                                                         \nwellness seem to be used interchangeably to define a variety of health-inducing measures introduced in  both \nprivate companies and state agencies. Roy Shepard e .g. has provided a perceptive if now slightly outda ted \nindustrial fitness handbook (that could just as wel l have been labelled as \u201cindustrial wellness\u201d) , in cluding its \nroots in the military, workers\u2019 organisations and s tate initiatives, the assessment of stress in the w orkplace, \nattitudes towards leisure, health-screening and pro gramming principles as well as cost/benefit analyse s.

They became  not just consumers of health services \nbut also quasi-producers of their health status. A theoretical shift reflecting these changes \ncan be identified which undermines more traditional  oppositions between health and illness. \nHealth promotion has emerged against this changing theoretical backdrop. 470  \n \nRelatively early on then, the North American contex t seems to have fostered strongly \ninstitutionalised organisations \u2013both on the level of corporations, universities, insurances, \netc. and on the level of state administration and a gencies\u2013 in order to encourage individuals \nto take concrete measures to improve their health. 471  This in turn was and is still reflected in \nthe commercial health offer (e.g. in terms of funct ional food, health supplements and \nappliances, etc.). In Germany however, and in Europ e to a large extent, developments have \nbeen almost reversed, since strongly socialised hea lth systems have only recently undergone \nextensive reforms and are now periodically threaten ed with partial privatisation and/or \ndismantlement due to the perception of uncontainabl e costs. 472  Hence, from the early 1980s \nin Germany, it is the industry, services and media that have helped to usher in an era of \nheightened body awareness by pushing a great variet y of holistically-bent products on the \n                                                 \n470  Health Promotion: Disciplines, diversity, and devel opments , Eds Robin Bunton & Gordon Macdonald, London \n& New York: Routledge, 2002, p. 13. For a more prec ise historical background, cf. also p. 14: \u201cHealth promotion \nfirst appeared as a term and concept in 1974, when the Canadian Minister of National Health and Welfar e, \nMarc Lalonde, published A New Perspective on the He alth of Canadians (Lalonde 1974). It introduced int o public \npolicy the idea that all causes of death and diseas e could be attributed to four discrete and distinct  elements: \ninadequacies in current health care provision; life style or behavioural factors; environmental polluti on; and \nfinally, big physical characteristics. The basic me ssage was that critical improvements within the env ironment (a \nstructuralist approach) and in behaviour (a lifesty le approach) could lead to a significant reduction in morbidity \nand premature death. As a result of this report, th e Canadian government shifted its emphasis in publi c policy \naway from treatment to prevention of illness, and u ltimately to the promotion of health. The Lalonde r eport \nechoed the concerns of many who had become critical  of a narrow view of health associated with the \u2018me dical \nmodel\u2019. Basaglia has expressed such sentiments, arg uing that the medical model somehow separates the \n\u2018soma\u2019 from the \u2018psyche\u2019, the disease from the pati ent, and the patient from the society in which he o r she lives \n(Basaglia 1986). The roots of this model are said t o lie in scientific explanations, aetiologies, clin ical diagnoses, \nand prognoses that ignore the far more complex soci al issues facing individuals in the world, such as \nemployment (or unemployment), housing (or homelessn ess), and low income, or cultures engendering \nbehaviour harmful to health.\u201d   \n471  This approach is convincingly described in Promoting Human Wellness: new frontiers for researc h, practice \nand policy , Eds Margaret Schneider Jamner and Daniel Stokols,  Berkeley, Los Angeles & London: University of \nCalifornia Press, 2000, p. 74: \u201cIn conclusion, problems in health care might be ch aracterized by the three A\u2019s: \naffordability, access, and accountability. These th ree problems are interrelated. Health care became e xpensive \nbecause a traditional biomedical model rewarded pro viders for doing procedures on the basis of the dia gnoses. \nThe excessive expense of care made the costs prohib itive, and many people lost access to the system. H owever, \nthe expensive system has been unable to demonstrate  that it provides benefits to patients. An alternat ive to the \nbiomedical model, known as the outcomes model sugge sts that population health status might be enhanced  if \nresources are shifted away from procedure-based rei mbursement and toward primary prevention.\u201d  \n472  Cf. e.g. just one random example among hundreds of  articles: [no author], \u201cKranksein wird in Deutschl and \nimmer teurer\u201d, Die Welt , online edition, 06.04.2011, \nhttp://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article13087093/Krank sein-wird-in-Deutschland-immer-teurer.html . \nOtherwise, the following report provides a compact overview of health issues in Germany in 2007: \u201cDer Markt \nder Gesundheit\u201d, Focus medialine, December 2007, ac cessible online here: \nhttp://www.medialine.de/media/uploads/projekt/media line/docs/bestellung_download/marktanalysen/2007/ \nfoc_ma_gesundheit_200712.pdf   [websites accessed Aug. 2011] 130 \n \nmarket. Taking advantage of a conceptual and instit utional no man\u2019s land, 473  they have thus \nsignificantly contributed to the evolving of a spec ific wellness mediation discourse. And it is \nonly in the early 1990s that some institutional eff orts have been directed towards the \nanalysis, containment and steering of the commercia l wellness boom. 474   \n \nThese contrasting continental perspectives on the p henomenon can be strikingly illustrated \nby comparing two definitions. The first was found o n the UC Berkeley wellness portal in \n2002: \n \nWellness is a way of living that emphasizes such pr eventive measures as eating a healthy \ndiet, making exercise an enjoyable part of your lif e, and making self-care decisions that will \nimprove the quality of your life. This means reduci ng your risk for chronic disease, preventing \ninjuries, banishing environmental and safety hazard s from your home and workplace, and \neliminating unnecessary trips to the doctor \u2013 but m aking best use of the health-care system \nwhen you need it. The premise of wellness is that y ou can live a long, healthy, and active life. \nAll you need is the desire to do so \u2013 and the right  information on which to base your \nactions. 475  \n \nWellness here is not envisioned as a temporary \u201cfee l good\u201d fad: the emphasis is more on \nprevention, longevity, personal responsibility and a holistic, environmental approach to a \nhealthy lifestyle than it is on \u201chedonistic\u201d pleasu re-seeking. Significantly, the holistic \napproach thus envisaged implicitly breaks down the division between work and leisure. \nIndeed, in order to be truly effective, wellness mo nitoring must be a constant conscious \neffort to streamline both work and leisure strategi es in order to attain improved quality of \n                                                 \n473  This is not to say that public health was inexiste nt in Germany but its late development (starting in  the \n1980s) means that it did not originally prove much of an ideological counterweight for the commercial fitness \nand wellness booms. For a very compact overview of the history of public health or \n\u201cGesundheitswissenschaften\u201d in Germany, Wikipedia p rovides an exceptionally good and well-referenced \narticle here: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesundheitswissenschaf ten . The history section explains the vast \ntime-lag between Anglo-Saxon and German development s as a consequence of the national-socialist \ninstrumentalisation of former public health interes ts, and its consequent ostracising in the post WW2- period. \nThe resurrection of public health was apparently du e to a joining of forces between hard and social sc ience \nresearchers in projects heavily financed by public institutions in a climate where social (especially patient-\noriented) and environmental movements challenged th e purely body-mechanical orientation of medicine. \n[website accessed Aug. 2011] \n474  Besides the slowly growing impact of public health  initiatives (cf. previous footnote), 1990 witnesse d the \nfoundation of two private institutions for the prom otion of wellness: the German Wellness Association \n[Deutscher Wellness Verband e.V. or DWV] in D\u00fcsseld orf and the European Wellness Union [Europ\u00e4ische \nWellness Union or EWU] in Wesseling. One could also  mention efforts such as the \u201cWellness-Urlaub in \nOstbayern\u201c [Wellness Holidays in East Bavaria] broc hure published by the Tourist Office of East Bavari a, \nRegensburg, 1998 or \u201cGesucht: wellness\u201d [Wanted: we llness], a booklet compiled and published by the \nVerbraucher-Zentrale Nordrhein-Westfalen e.V. [i.e.  a prominent consumers association in the North-Wes tern \npart of Germany], D\u00fcsseldorf, 2001, which aims to s hed a critical light on the benefits and the traps of the \nwellness offer. For this information, I am indebted  to the inputs of Lutz Hertel, the director of the German \nWellness Association, both in terms of our talks an d his article \u201cWellness und Gesundheitsf\u00f6rderung in  den \nUSA: Begriffskl\u00e4rung, Entwicklungen und Realisierun gen im betrieblichen Bereich\u201d, Zeitschrift f\u00fcr \npr\u00e4ventivmedizinische Gesundheistf\u00f6rderung , 1992, 4, pp. 36-48. \n475  Definition of wellness from the Wellness Letter: F oundations of wellness / UC Berkeley WELLNESS LETTE R: \nwww.berkeleywellness.com/html/fw/fwIntro.html .

In short, it represents a much more medicalis ed, risk-conscious approach than the one \nenvisioned in the following satirical definition, d rawn from the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung  \u2013a \nSwiss-German newspaper popular on both sides of the  Rhine: \n \nWellness is the sluggish sister of fitness, enriche d with a little hedonism and sensuousness. If \nthe hallmarks of fitness are suffering, sweat and t he fight against the inner couch potato, \nwellness can truly be identified as the loving care  of the latter. Wellness is the mystical made \nflesh, the link between East and West, pleasure and  duty, sports and fun, hot and cold, as \nwell as new and old. It seems almost inconceivable that we have managed to survive without \nit for so long. 476  \n \nHowever, despite or because of its irony, this defi nition does a really good job of re-\ncapturing the associations and contradictions surro unding the perception and practice of \nfitness and wellness in the German-speaking context . 477  It emphasises the affiliation of the \ntwo ideologies and points to a form of schizophreni c division of labour between these two \nrealms of body management. On the one hand, fitness  is seen as governed by a \u201ccontrolling\u201d \ndiscourse on the importance of appropriate physical  training, physiological performance, \nrational shaping, etc. On the other, wellness is pr opelled by a form of \u201credemptory\u201d \ndiscourse, a back-to-nature body ecumenism steered by the subjectivity of the consumer \u2013in \nother words a \u201cwhat feels good is good for you\u201d exh ortation. 478  \n \nMoreover the sentence \u201cWellness is the mystical made flesh, the link betw een East and \nWest, pleasure and duty, sports and fun, hot and co ld, as well as new and old\u201d  is key to \nunderstanding the contemporary commercial wellness offer in Germany (and other parts of \nEurope). This bridging or rather encapsulating of d ualisms is really the essence of \nContinental wellness. In order to recapture the dri ving force behind wellness, Claudia Freidl \nbases her analysis of this ideology on the concept of the \u201cMulti-option Society\u201d, developed \nby the Swiss sociologist Peter Gross, 479  which she succinctly sums up as follows: \n \n                                                 \n476  M\u00fcller, Joni, Das Seelenheil im Dampfbad, Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung Folio , February 2000, online magazine, \nhttp://www.nzzfolio.ch/www/d80bd71b-b264-4db4-afd0- 277884b93470/showarticle/e3b0f399-0ab0-4b7b-\n92af-39bfb2f5170a.aspx : \u201cWellness ist die tr\u00e4ge Schwester der Fitness, ange reichert mit etwas Hedonismus und \nSinnlichkeit. Steht bei der Fitness das Leiden im V ordergrund, der Schweiss und der Kampf gegen den in neren \nSchweinehund, so kann Wellness durchaus als dessen liebevolle Pflege bezeichnet werden. Wellness ist \ngleichsam die Fleisch gewordene Esoterik, die Verbi ndung von Okzident und Orient, von Lust und Last, v on Sport \nund Spass, von Heiss und Kalt und Neu und Alt.

Hartung) of Marc Schwieger, an advertisin g \nprofessional also pointedly illustrates the semioti c flexibility of the wellness concept as perceived from a \nGerman point of view.

These are replaced by optio ns that, henceforth, should be obeyed as \nrealisable desires. The actualisation of as many op tions as possible becomes the epitome of \nexistential purpose; a massive societal pressure to  fulfil options develops. However people \nare confused by the variety of options and unable t o cope. Indeed, multioptionality \nsystematically fails to deliver what it promises. 480  \n \nEven if multioptionality perhaps fails to deliver w hat it promises because it offers highly \nindividual solutions to problems that can (or shoul d) be framed in much broader socio-\neconomic terms \u2013an aspect I will be discussing late r on in this Chapter\u2013481  it nevertheless has \nbecome a pervasively dominant mode of consumerism i n general and wellness in particular. \nA special edition on wellness of Querformat , a magazine devoted to contemporary issues, art \nand popular culture, documents the wide ideological  and socio-economic penetration of \nwellness in a broad variety of (sometimes unexpecte d) realms 482  \u2013from art, to coaching, \nprofessional perspectives, brothels, architecture, music, etc.:  \n \nWellness is deeply infiltrated in the daily life of  affluent societies and, for a long time now, \nhas ceased to offer pampering options only to the e lites. Whoever cannot afford relaxing \n\u201cwild flower compresses\u201d or \u201cmountain herb baths\u201d i n a Swiss luxury spa or an Ayurveda \ntreatment in Sri Lanka, is presented with more affo rdable options. Beyond \u201csauna worlds\u201d or \n\u201cwaterparks\u201d, there are plenty of emotionalised pro duct-ranges in the low-budget segment: \nharmony toast and relaxation tea provide the needed  \u201cbalance\u201d, aloe vera is found not only \nin cosmetics but also in yogurt that \u201cindulges our senses\u201d, and Marlboro even sells smoking \nas a relaxing Pilates exercise. 483   \n \nMoreover, the search for existential meaning or pur pose by means of a (w)hol(e)istic offer is \na central if often latent motif of the wellness ide ology. From the start, even in the U.S., \nwellness has been associated or \u201ctainted\u201d with (par a-)religious or at least spiritual aspects \u2013\nand this long before the likes of Dean Ornish, Deep ak Chopra or Andrew Weil took it down \nclearly new-agey paths... Indeed, Donald Ardell one  of the pioneer theorists and \npractitioners of North American wellness, reminds u s that Halbert Dunn \u2013the actual father of \n                                                 \n480  Cf.

The former is based on faith,  emotions, supernaturalism, the recovery \nmovement, wishful thinking, weepy/swaying hand-hold ing, New Age mysticism, guru-\nworship and all things antediluvian and reprehensib le; the latter is based on science, \npersonal responsibility, critical thinking, exercis e and fitness and a conscious quest for added \nmeaning and purpose in life. As you might intuit, I  favor the latter school of wellness. 485  \n \nIn Ardell\u2019s case, the perception of a well-defined schism may well be a reflection of current \nAmerican positions on wellness but his rather scorn ful appraisal of spiritually-oriented \nwellness seems to be more a function of his persona l sensitivity since he is (self-?)described \nas \u201c[...] the Well Infidel [who]  favors evidence over faith, reason over revelation  and meaning \nand purpose over spirituality\u201d  in the wake of an article anticipating the potenti al demise of \nreligion. 486  However, as far as I perceive it, there is no clea r distinction between the more \nmaterial and the more soulful aspects of wellness i n the German/European context. What is \nobvious there though is that the spiritual is stron gly commodified in both materialised and \nembodied forms \u2013along the principles of recombinanc e. With the \u201cAnanda Tea\u201d example, \ndiscussed in the \u201cCommodification\u201d section of Chapt er 3 (Theory), I provided a good \nexample of the former while Freidl, in her discussi on of the spiritual component of wellness, \ndraws our attention to the latter:  \n \nThe sporty-spiritual age has already begun.

Just, as \nin other realms of consumption, spirituality in wel lness also obeys the escalation imperative \nof \u201cBigger, Better, Faster, More\u201d 489  \u2013 a dimension crucial to both the work and leisure  \nrealms. \n \nIndeed, the ironical definition of wellness I quote d above, also posited it as the link between \npleasure and duty as well as sports and fun. It hin ged, if not explicitly so, on the gradual \ndimming of the distinction between work and leisure . Peter Becker, in his analysis of the \nGerman \u201cmovement\u201d or sports scene analyses this blu rring of boundaries as follows: \u201cIn \nthese past few years a holistic body ecology was de veloped in the expectation of a new \nreconciliation between inner and outer nature, whic h had been divided into two life realms \nby modernity, a reconciliation that would also reun ite the two fields of knowledge pertaining \nto them.\u201d 490  His emphasis then is more on the interplay between  a subjective inner reality \nand an outside world. He then concretely tracks a t ransition from so-called \u201cold body \nmovements\u201d to \u201cnew body movements\u201d characterised by  a number of dichotomies.  \n \nThe first dichotomy he discusses is a transition fr om a form of \u201cwe-proximity\u201d emblematised \nby sports association programmes such as \u201cTrimm dic h\u201d [shape up] or \u201cSport ist im Verein \nam sch\u00f6nsten\u201d [Sports in a club is the most enjoyab le] 491  to an \u201cI-proximity\u201d (e.g. body \ntherapies, tai chi chuan, yoga, expressive dancing,  shiatsu). This dichotomy points towards \nthe tension between the need to connect/communicate  with others and the need to \nappropriate the self \u2013through body-mediated experie nce. The second binomial outlined by \nBecker contrasts body movements seen as isolated pu rveyors of security (e.g. training and \nfitness programmes to invest in the future of the b ody, where efforts are directed towards \nregeneration and increased performance in other dom ains) with holistic body and \nmovement representations (e.g. non isolated movemen t forms which are loosely related to \nhealth and/or nutrition as well as the social and n atural environment, e.g. sauna or hiking \nand more generally \u201csofter\u201d in- and outdoor practic es).

This third dichotomy thus \nemphasises the tension between controlling and play ing with (or experiencing) the body. 492   \n \nThe author then emphasises that even though these d ichotomies are a bit artificial, they \nmake the fundamental options clear. Moreover, these  options are reconcilable within \nindividual lifestyles and indeed often complement e ach other harmoniously in everyday life. \nIn this context, the new movement culture provides a form of repairing process that \ncompensates for what is perceived as the loss of so cial relations and orientation models \ntriggered by modernity. It offers \u201ccounter-lifestyle-scenarios wherein identity sketc hes and \nlifestyle desires, which cannot be lived out in oth er realms, can be articulated and enables the \nlonged-for bringing together of self-image and worl d-image\u201d .493  Becker\u2019s conclusions thus \nnot only apply to the \u201cmovement realm\u201d but can be a dapted to other aspects of fitness and \nwellness such as nutrition, cosmetics and alternati ve or mainstream body therapies and \npractices. Nevertheless, this soothing and seemingl y liberating vision of a harmonious co-\nexistence between outside and inside, work and leis ure or discipline and regeneration \nshould not obscure the more troubling undercurrent I hinted at when discussing Jeremy \nRifkin\u2019s ambivalent views earlier on in this chapte r. Indeed, wellness, just as biotechnologies, \nis implicitly predicated upon a corporate, highly c ommodified health ethos. \n \nFitness and wellness: a new form of internalised li festyle discrimination? \nAlain Ehrenberg, a French sociologist, in his book on depression as the mental disease of the \npost-industrial era, traces the impact of post-Ford ist production on contemporary \u201cflexible \nmanagement\u201d strategies:  \n \nIn the corporate environment, the disciplinarian (T aylorian and Fordian) models of human \nresource management are gradually being replaced by  norms inciting the personnel to adopt \nautonomous behaviours, even in the lower ranks of t he hierarchy. [\u2026] The modes of \nregulation and domination of the work force are les s based on mechanical obedience than on \ninitiative: responsibility, the capacity to evolve and make projects, motivation, flexibility, etc. \nare the tenets of a new managerial liturgy. [\u2026] Tod ay\u2019s human relationship engineers strive \ntowards the production of autonomy. It is less a qu estion of submitting the bodies than of \nenlisting the emotions and the mental abilities of each wage-earner. 494   \n \nBut the trends that apply to the world of work orga nisation \u2013characterised by a gradual shift \nfrom a hard(-ware) to a soft(-ware) vision of human  engineering\u2013 are also neatly mirrored by \ncontemporary developments in the realm of health.

Instead, they are strongly encouraged to \ndraw on a number of softer \u201cbodies of knowledge\u201d fr om a wide range of sources that \u2013at \nleast to some extent\u2013 take into account both the sp ecificities of their individual physiologies \nand their subjective needs. Moreover, the active fo stering of health and well-being is \nperceived as an inroad into successful personality management as well as an effective HR \nstrategy:  \n \nNowadays, employees are no longer willing to sacrif ice themselves for a company that does \nnot provide job satisfaction. People want to be hap py at work. Hence companies have to \nprevent team haemorrhage as well as final departure s by providing \u201cbetter-being\u201d in order to \nfoster \u201cbetter-doing\u201d. Emotions and pleasure in the  work realm \u2013concepts that were long \ntaboo\u2013 have thus gained in meaningfulness and disse mination. Managers are currently \nincreasingly aware of the fact that happiness is th e guarantor of an improved work \nperformance. They have recently realised that emplo yees\u2019 achievements and efficiency are \ndirectly linked to their vital energy. In an age of  transmodernity, neomanagement or more \nsimply in an age when companies agree that investme nts in the \u201csocial pole\u201d have become \nindispensable (now that the predominance of the eco nomic and environmental poles has \nbeen questioned), Wellness Management provides a va luable option. Nowadays, it is one of \nthe axes of prospective management. 495     \n \nNevertheless, just as \u201chappy autonomy\u201d is not a sel f-generating property in the corporate \nworld \u2013but has to be more or less subtly induced an d controlled\u2013 there are matching \nincentives and strictures in body management. For t he American context, Peter Conrad and \nDiana Walsh convincingly describe how in the course  of the 1970s, so-called EAPs (employee \nassistance programmes), worksite \u201cwellness\u201d program mes as well as drug screening \ninitiatives began to increasingly encroach upon emp loyees\u2019 private lives and lifestyles, 496  to \nwit:   \n \nWellness programs consist of health education scree ning, and/or intervention designed to \nchange employees\u2019 behaviour in a healthward directi on by reducing known health risks, \nespecially those felt to be within employees\u2019 own c ontrol. Programs range from single \ninterventions to a whole menu of alternatives and i n some cases include well-integrated \nlong-term strategies [...].

Cf. Conrad, P eter & \nWalsh, Diana C., \u201cThe New Corporate Health Ethic: L ifestyle and the Social Control of Work\u201d, International \nJournal of Health Services , Vol. 22, Nr 1, 1992, pp. 89-111. 137 \n \nback injury, cancer risk screening and reduction, s elf-care and health information. Many \nprograms begin with some type of \u2018health risk appra isal\u2019 to quantify employees\u2019 health risks \nand inspire them to undertake a regimen to break th eir risky habits and presumably improve \ntheir health. 497    \n \nThe fact that companies have at last realised that health is not confined to the occupational \nsphere may be considered positive, however, the aut hors here perceive a potentially big \nproblem in the generalisation of screening procedur es and the fact that screening is \nprogressively expanding to all sorts of diseases an d (bad) habits, thus covertly contributing \nto a new breed of lifestyle discrimination. 498  However, the authors note that participation in \nthese programmes is (still) voluntary but rendered attractive by a number of more or less \ncoercive incentives -from sports gear and cash to a  more intangible factor that may influence \nraises and promotions. Strikingly, the corporate fi tness offer itself is a powerful incentive \nsince \u201cIn virtually all of the comprehensive programs we have visited or examined, fitness \nactivities \u2013 aerobics, running, jogging, exercising  with special equipment, and the like \u2013 are \nby some distance the most popular and frequently ut ilized of the program\u2019s offering.\u201d  \nHowever, participation in the programmes is difficu lt to assess and, ironically, they tend to \nattract the white-collar employees who seem to need  them the least since they \u201care \nyounger, somewhat healthier, and already pursuing f itness on their own.\u201d 499   \n \nMoreover, \u201c although certain program components may be \u2018cost-ef fective,\u2019 in that they more \nthan return the rather modest investments required to support them\u201d ,500  the authors \nemphasise that even if health-care costs have sky-r ocketed, the economic argument is not \nreally watertight since health promotion rationales  display serious conceptual flaws:  \n \nFirst, since spouses and dependents normally accoun t for two-third or more of corporate \nhealth expenditures and retirees account for increa singly large shares of many firms\u2019 health \ncosts, programs seriously directed at affecting the  costs of employee health benefits would \nbe marketed aggressively to these populations outsi de the active workforce, and seldom are. \nSecond, any cost savings from preventing illness in  the future by reducing stress, eliminating \nrisk factors, or treating drug abuse are unlikely t o be realized immediately except in the rare \ncase. Most potential savings are deferred, yet turn over rates in U.S. industry are averaging as \nhigh as 50 percent in ten years, so it is unclear h ow much individual companies could accrue \nin cost savings. Third, for the many companies that  cover retirees\u2019 health care, keeping \nfuture retirees alive longer could actually cost mo re, not less. Fourth, while controlling costs \nmay be a stated rationale, it has been the rare cor poration that has made any kind of \nattempt to track the economic impact of programs. 501   \nThus, despite the fact that the necessary cost-cont ainment evaluations may be difficult and \nexpensive to carry out, cost-cutting is debunked as  an \u201cacceptable rationale\u201d  for companies \nto cover the fact that the issue here is \u201cmore about problems of social control in the \nworkplace and workers\u2019 productivity than about prob lems of medical care cost control and \nworkers\u2019 health.\u201d 502  Conrad and Walsh perceive this trend as part of th e historical \n                                                 \n497  Cf. ibid., p. 95. \n498  Cf. ibid., p. 99-100 & p. 104. \n499  Cf. ibid. \n500  Cf. ibid., p. 96. \n501  Ibid., pp. 101-102. \n502  Ibid. 138 \n \ndevelopment of worker control \u2013from externalised to  internalised measures and from \nexercising discipline to fostering devotion: \nRather than the formal rules of the bureaucratic mo del, emphasis is more squarely placed on \n\u2018shared values,\u2019 which are usually the corporation\u2019 s values. Whereas Taylorism standardized \nthe work process, the new corporate health ethic st andardizes the worker by selecting and \nshaping employees on the basis of their lifestyles.  [...] Corporate goals remain unchanged \u2013 \nto maximize productivity and profitability; only th e means to those ends is being \ntransformed. 503   \nEven if corporate health measures in Germany may st ill boast less of a stranglehold on \nworkers than in the U.S., German workers as consume rs can hardly avoid becoming the \nengineers of their own health even if they may have  more of a choice between various \nstrategic options. A good institutional illustratio n of this \u201creward and accountability\u201d \nphenomenon can be found in the field of health insu rance. In Germany, the last decade or so \nhas witnessed an increase in voluntary disease prev ention or management programmes \nmarketed by health insurances. 504  While providing information, professional support and \nnetworking facilities in areas as diverse as dietar y recommendations, sports advice or \nhygiene as well as a broad variety of fitness and w ellness classes (not to mention material \ninfrastructure such as so-called \u201chealth trails\u201d), these programmes also require registered \nindividuals to actively participate in terms of rep orting to professionals, exchanging \ninformation with peers, attending workshops or conf erences, eating healthily, working out \nregularly, etc. If participation in these programme s is still voluntary, one can easily foresee \nhow the increasing privatisation of healthcare coul d lead to similarly compulsory (or at least \nmore coercive) measures as in the U.S. \nThus, the trend towards autonomy and flexibility in  a post-Fordist work organisation has \ndirect consequences for bodies employed in this con text. As Ehrenberg suggested, bodies in \npost-industrial economies may no longer be submitte d to concrete mechanical moulding but \n                                                 \n503  Ibid., p. 106. The authors even ask: \u201cDoes the new health ethic foreshadow a return to t he tenets of welfare \ncapitalism, discredited four decades ago, now cloak ed in less overtly paternalistic and perhaps more a cceptable \ngarb?\u201d  Ibid., p. 107.  \n504  For instance, the AOK , a statutory health insurance, describes its bonus  program [AOK Pr\u00e4mienprogramm] \nas follows: \u201c\u201eWir schreiben Ihnen Punkte gut: f\u00fcr sportliche Ak tivit\u00e4ten, f\u00fcr die Teilnahme an Veranstaltungen, \nf\u00fcr Vorsorgeuntersuchungen und vieles mehr.

Patients are even offered up to EUR 500.- if they  are willing to forego some of the \ninsurance\u2019s services [the so-called \u201eAOK-Wahltarife \u201d]. Another relatively new offer is a chronic disea se \nmanagement programme [the so-called \u201eAOK-Curaplan\u201d]  that encourages patients suffering from e.g. breas t \ncancer, diabetes types I and II or coronary heart d iseases to actively participate in preventive and m onitoring \nmeasures (cf. http://www.aok.de/?logurl=%2Fnavi%2Ftopnav%2Fsuche. php ). A similar incentive is also \ndescribed in the field of dental health, when tooth  replacement becomes inevitable: \u201eDie AOK belohnt \nPatienten, die regelm\u00e4\u00dfig ihre Z\u00e4hne gepflegt und K ontrolluntersuchungen beim Zahnarzt wahrgenommen \nhaben. Sie erhalten einen h\u00f6heren Zuschuss.\u201c   [The AOK website was originally accessed in April  and May 2007; \nunfortunately, the links are no longer valid \u2013hence  the original quotes are inaccessible\u2013 but these pr ogrammes \nstill exist and the essence of the discourse remain s very similar]. Other insurances such as BKK  or Securvita  \nprovide similar incentives, cf. e.g.:  \nhttp://www.bkk-deutsche-bank.de/content/leistungen_ bkk-bkk_bonus_plus.html  or \nhttp://www.securvita.de/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF-D ateien/krankenkasse/m-Bonusprogramm__70.pdf  \n(where \u2013significantly enough\u2013 points are described as \u201chealth miles\u201d\u2026) [these websites accessed Aug. 2 011] 139 \n \ntheir disciplining or conditioning is increasingly achieved through the emotional and mental \nincentives developed by human engineering. Since ob vious mechanical work pressure can no \nlonger be blamed directly for ill health \u2013civilisat ion diseases often being the long-term, hard-\nto-trace multifactorial consequences of excessive s edentariness, not only can the province of \nhealth prevention be gradually shifted towards empl oyees (hence consumers) but it can also \nbe increasingly re-ascribed to the leisure sphere, i.e. beyond working hours. In this context, \njust as corporate employees have to show mental or emotional flexibility and initiative to \ncope with the unpredictable fluctuations of the glo bal stock market, they must \u2013as \nconsumers\u2013 take responsibility for the growing immo bilisation hence the fuzzy risk potential \nof their bodies:   \nResponsibility, like health, is a primary value, a lodestar on the horizon of modernity based \non the philosophy of the Enlightenment. [\u2026] in the slipstream of technological advances, a \nnumber of small and at first barely noticeable step s attach new meaning to the concept of \nresponsibility by adapting it to what is technicall y feasible. Anyone who does not play along \nthus appears irresponsible \u2013 suspect, if not downri ght guilty. 505  \nHowever, this sense of responsibility is engineered  in such a way as to make participation in \nthe system appear not only voluntary but even desir able. Indeed, ideologically speaking, the \nnew individual management of the body as prescribed  by the doctrines of fitness and \nwellness, somewhat chillingly echoes the \u201cfriendly\u201d  and desire-powered commercial \neugenics so ironically described by Jeremy Rifkin i n his initial quote. 506  But just as the new \nflexible work ethic is not articulated in a world o f endlessly satisfying self-development and -\nfulfilment options, the desire for a healthy (i.e. a fit, attractive and well) body is anchored in \nan economy of lack. In fact more than the \u201cdesire\u201d,  one should probably speak of individuals\u2019 \nincreasing \u201cneed\u201d for performance, resistance, resi lience etc. \u2013a need that is triggered by the \nperception of a myriad health threats in contempora ry society: \n \nThe structuring of a new health consciousness is wo rthy of notice, a consciousness instigated \nby individuals\u2019 discovery that they themselves must  negotiate with the environment in order \nto remain healthy or to avoid illness. The populari sation of the stress concept, which was first \nconceived in a laboratory, points to significant ad justments: one is personally responsible for \nillness, one must become the mediator of one\u2019s body  \u2013a seismograph measuring pressures\u2013 \nand one must cultivate scepticism towards food, and  even towards one\u2019s own nature. The \nbody and the self thus gradually merge into a type of negative synthesis and illnesses can \nonly be understood as an interaction between the bo dy, the self and the dominating norms \nof society. 507  \n                                                 \n505  Beck, Ulrich & Beck-Gernsheim, Elisabeth, op. cit. , p. 146.  \n506  Cf. also Volkwein, Karin A.E., op. cit., p. XIV: \u201cWhile the previous fitness movements were dictated  and \nsupported from the outside, e.g., the military, nat ional leaders, and employers, it could be argued th at this new \nfitness development is driven by individuals from w ithin. This might be a major reason why this latest  fitness \nmovement has been much more influential than its pr edecessors and is on the brink of becoming a \u2018globa l\u2019 \ncultural phenomenon.\u201d  \n507  Rittner, Volker, op. cit., p. 47: \u201eBemerkenswert sind die Strukturen eines neuen Gesu ndheitsbewu\u00dftseins, \nangestiftet durch die Entdeckung des Individuums, d a\u00df es selbst mit der Umwelt verhandeln mu\u00df, um gesu nd zu \nbleiben bzw. Krankheit zu vermeiden. Die Popularisi erung des Stre\u00dfkonzeptes, das zuerst in einem Labor  \nkonzipiert wurde, deutet auf wesentliche Umstellung en: man ist selbst f\u00fcr die Krankheit verantwortlich , man \nmu\u00df Moderator seines K\u00f6rpers sein, Seismograph von Belastungen, skeptisch gegen\u00fcber der Nahrung, skept isch \ngegen\u00fcber den eigenen Eigenschaften.(*) K\u00f6rper und Selbst r\u00fccken zusammen, in einer Art negativen Synt hese, \ndie Krankheiten lassen sich nur verstehen als Zusam menspiel von K\u00f6rper, Selbst und herrschenden Normen  der \nGesellschaft.\u201c   140 \n \n \nIn this model of health prevention, there is no roo m left for the agency of a divinity or fate \nexternal to the individual and less and less room f or the agency of viruses, microbes or \ngenetic eccentricities. Instead, the entire burden seems to rest on individuals\u2019 accountability: \ndanger is ubiquitous and individuals must therefore  cultivate a continuous awareness of \ninner and environmental threats while constantly ne gotiating with both. Thus, a culture of \nexternal risks upon which the modern subject had re latively little direct influence (in a \ncentrally controlled biomedical model) has been rep laced by an increasingly internalised risk \nconsciousness that systematically confronts late mo dern subjects with their own potential \nand shortcomings. Thus, it is inappropriate lifesty le and misguided self-management that are \nseen as representing the truly endemic threats to h ealth.   \n \nMuriel Gillick debunks this myth by reminding her r eaders that personal prevention provides \nbut an illusion of control since heredity, culture and chance play a much greater role in the \ndetermination of mortality. 508  Moreover, even from a large-scale economic perspec tive, she \nposits that prevention may only save money in the s hort term. 509  Thus, her parting shot \nreminds her readers of the limits of personal preve ntion, while pointing to its potential \nideological danger:  \n \nOne of the great insights of the democratic politic al tradition of the past half century is the \nrecognition that, even in America, much that needs improving is outside the personal \npurview, an understanding that the joggers seem to prefer to deny. And surely one of the \nmajor intellectual triumphs of the past hundred yea rs has been the relocation of the basis of \ndisease in science rather than in sin, a developmen t which health promotion, for all its \nvirtues, is at risk of undermining. 510   \n \nIn largely secularised societies, \u201csin\u201d as a religi ous notion is likely to be replaced by a much \nmore diffuse but no less potent sense of guilt that  places the entire responsibility for health \non individuals\u2019 shoulders.  \n \n                                                 \n508  Gillick, Muriel R, op. cit., p. 384. This seems to  be underscored by the figures provided by George S age \nillustrating the minimal improvement of fitness in American youth over the past 40 years, cf. Sage, Ge orge H., \n\u201cThe Political Economy of Fitness in the United Sta tes\u201d, Fitness as cultural phenomenon, op. cit., p. 125.  \n509  Ibid., p. 382: \u201cCertainly prevention does save money in the short run, by substituting inexpensive health \neducation programs for expensive programs such as m ore health insurance coverage or provision of artif icial \nhearts. Over the long run, though, the claim that a n ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure is m ore \nrhetoric than reality on a societal level: preventi ng sudden death from a heart attack at age 65 may w ell lead to \ngreater medical expenses when that individual dies a lingering death from stroke or cancer ten years l ater.\u201d  \nGillick should know since she is an acknowledged sp ecialist in the healthcare of elderly patients... \n510  Ibid., p. 384. She is rejoined here by Maguire: \u201c[...] the delegation of responsibility for health to the individual \nis deeply problematic: health is perceived as a per sonal problem of choices and motivation, despite th e \nfundamentally social and structural causes of illne ss and attitudes towards health.\u201d  Cf. Maguire, Jennifer Smith, \nop. cit., pp. 46-47. Further Maguire elaborates as follows: \u201cDrawing on Mills (1959), the fat/fit paradox of th e \npast three decades, in which fitness industries hav e boomed alongside increasing rates of population i nactivity \nand obesity, can be understood as the rational outc ome of addressing a social, structural problem with  an \nindividualized solution. The result has been a furt her entrenchment of the existing class divide in he alth, and the \nrationalization of health and exercise as matters o f appearance management and status consumption.\u201d  Conrad \nand Walsh also concur: \u201c[the] emphasis on individual responsibility and se lf-reliance can divert attention from \nenvironmental or social systemic problems and can s erve as a rationale for reducing medical care \nexpenditures.\u201d Cf. Conrad, Peter & Walsh, Diana C., op. cit., p. 9 9.  141 \n \nOver the course of two books, \u201cIllness as Metaphor\u201d  and \u201cAIDS and Its Metaphors\u201d ,511  Susan \nSontag has pointedly explored the metaphors linked to the experience of cancer (compared \nto tuberculosis) and later AIDS. Building, among ot hers, on her own experience with cancer, \nshe uncovers the frighteningly obscurantist reactio ns triggered by the onset of one of the \nmost common modern-day diseases: \u201cAny disease that is treated as a mystery and acute ly \nenough feared will be felt to be morally, if not li terally, contagious. Thus a surprisingly large \nnumber of people find themselves being shunned by r elatives and friends and are the object \nof practices of decontamination by members of their  household, as if cancer, like TB, were an \ninfectious disease. \u201d512  Furthermore, not only do civilisation diseases thr eaten the protection \nor cohesion offered by one\u2019s intimate sphere, they just as devastatingly impact one\u2019s larger \nsocial and professional life: \u201cSince getting cancer can be a scandal that jeopard izes one\u2019s love \nlife, one\u2019s chance of promotion, even one\u2019s job, pa tients who know what they have tend to be \nextremely prudish, if not outright secretive, about  their disease.\u201d 513  Thus, while sin was \n\u201csimply\u201d perceived as a misalignment from divine wi ll, late modern guilt rests on much \nshakier ground since the multi-causality of most co ntemporary diseases makes it extremely \ndifficult to identify a single agent or behaviour r esponsible for them.514   \n \nThe anthropologist Emily Martin sheds an interestin g light on this phenomenon through her \nresearch on the perception of immunity. 515  She especially investigates the power of bodily \nmetaphors (present both in scientific and lay disco urse) to encapsulate and structure bio-\nphysiological understandings of the body. This enab les her to trace a metaphorical \ngenealogy from a body viewed as a machine with shar p contours modelled on mass \nproduction/conveyor belt processes through a body s een as a castle with fortifications to a \nbody interpreted as an extremely complex and often chaotic system, which paradoxically \nentails a much greater adaptability and flexibility :  \n \nThis new type of body that is attuned to its enviro nment presupposes that inner processes \nare the guarantors of health preservation. In stark  contrast with the sharply designed and \nclosed contours of body illustrations typical of th e 1950s and before, contemporary pictures \nincreasingly confront us with a body in movement, n ot quiet. Moreover it is a body that is \nutterly devoid of skin, thus uncovering the inner o perations of our protective system. 516  \n \nIn this context, Martin points to a worldview that is gaining increasing significance in \nimmunological circles \u2013a worldview that substitutes  the image of a \u201cdance with\u201d for that of a \n\u201cbattle against\u201d external enemies. 517  Nevertheless, this nakedly flexible dance required  from \n                                                 \n511  Originally published in 1978 and 1988 respectively  and available in a single book, e.g.: Sontag, Susa n,  Illness \nas Metaphor and AIDS and Its Metaphors , New York: Picador, 2001. \n512  Ibid. p. 6.  \n513  Ibid. p. 8.  \n514  In Chapter 7 ( Conclusion ), I discuss the moral tenor of fitness and wellnes s in more detail.  \n515  Cf. Martin, Emily, Flexible Bodies. Tracking Immunity in America from the Days of Polio to the Age of AIDS , \nBoston: Beacon Press, 1994. \n516  Cf. Martin, Emily, \u201cDie neue Kultur der Gesundheit : Soziale Geschlechtsidentit\u00e4t und das Immunsystem in \nAmerika\u201d, in: Physiologie und industrielle Gesellschaft , op. cit., p. 519: \u201eBei dieser neuen Art von K\u00f6rper, der auf \nseine Umwelt abgestimmt ist, z\u00e4hlen f\u00fcr die Erhaltu ng der Gesundheit innere Vorg\u00e4nge. In auffallendem \nGegensatz zu den randscharfen, an den Konturen gesc hlossenen Bildern des K\u00f6rpers in den f\u00fcnfziger Jahr en und \ndavor zeigen uns daher die heutigen Bilder immer me hr einen K\u00f6rper in Bewegung, nicht in Ruhe, und ein en \nganz und gar hautlosen K\u00f6rper dazu, der die inneren  Abl\u00e4ufe unseres sch\u00fctzenden Systems enth\u00fcllt.\u201c   \n517  In turn, Martin also comes to the conclusion that the flexibility entailed by this metaphor is a refl ection of \nthe \u201eflexibility\u201c obsession typical of the professi onal realm: \u201eAbgesehen von den Bildern des K\u00f6rpers, die von 142 \n \nindividuals does not really take into account the s train of permanent vulnerability, which is \nwhy Volker Rittner stresses the material and emotio nal need to erect a series of protective \nramparts against insecurity:      \n \nThe perception of stress, i.e. the increased percep tion of pathogenic factors such as the \ncarcinogenicity of beer or chips and ambition-drive n infarction risks, which like earlier \nepidemics or medieval plague outbreaks can just as surprisingly erupt out of normality, leads \nto an enhancement of health values and to a heighte ned demand for health, a type of health \nthat departs from official normality and its underl ying rationality. Vulnerable individuals thus \nseek to protect themselves by means of concrete def ences, through a healthy and fit body \nthat wards off danger, but which has to be supplied  with a certain amount of movement and \nrelaxation, through a concrete life world in the se nse expounded by Sch\u00fctz, that is through a \nstring of trusted, close and intimate things, throu gh behaviours and habits, in which concrete \naction, being with friends and naturalness play new  roles. These are worlds that reject \nincongruities and thus the danger of stress. 518   \n \nThis vision therefore neatly ties in with the ideol ogical tenets of fitness and wellness as I \nhave striven to depict them in this chapter. It emp hasises a vision of health prevention that \ncan be envisaged as potentially endless concentric circles surrounding the individual. These \ncircles do not seek to isolate a pathogen inside or  outside the body (and its repercussions on \nthe immune system) but are intended as protective ( if breathable\u2026) membranes that \nsubjectively filter and ward off the threats of the  environment \u2013whether the latter is viewed \nas almost shrink-wrapped to the body or conceived a s a much broader biotope. 519   \n \nStrangely enough then, even though Foucault was not  yet in a position to apprehend the \nrepercussions of fitness and wellness for late mode rn subjects, his distinction between four \ntypes of technologies, which I mentioned in Chapter  3 (Theory ), also uncannily applies to \nfitness and wellness, but with a twist. In this cas e, Foucault\u2019s definitions actually overlap \nbecause ALL four of them apply to fitness and welln ess technologies. To quote him again: \n \n                                                                                                                                                         \nImmunologen und von Nicht-Wissenschafterln gleicher massen hevorgebracht werden, haben unsere \nForschungen auch gezeigt, dass Flexibilitit\u00e4t, Anpa ssungsf\u00e4higkeit und die F\u00e4higkeit, als Antwort auf eine sich \nst\u00e4ndig ver\u00e4ndernde Umwelt behende und geschmeidig einen raschen Wandel zu vollziehen, zu den idealen \nEigenschaften von Betriebsorganisationen, Regierung en, Bildungseinrichtungen und anderen Institutionen  \navancieren.\u201c  Ibid. p. 519.  \n518 Rittner, Volker, op.cit., pp. 48-49: \u201eDie Wahrnehmung von Stre\u00df bzw. die gesteigerte Wah rnehmung von \npathogenen Faktoren, die aus der Normalit\u00e4t in \u00e4hnl ich \u00fcberraschender Weise herausbrechen k\u00f6nnen wie \nfr\u00fcher die Epidemien und Pestz\u00fcge des Mittelalters -die Kanzerogenit\u00e4t von Bier, von Pommes frites, di e  \nInfarktgef\u00e4hrdung durch Ehrgeiz usw.-, f\u00fchrt zu ein er Aufwertung des Gesundheitsmotivs und einer verst \u00e4rkten \nNachfrage von Gesundheit, einer Gesundheit, die sic h aus der offiziellen Normalit\u00e4t und ihrer Vernunft  entfernt. \nDie verwundbaren Individuen suchen sich durch Ringe  der Konkretheit zu umgeben und zu sch\u00fctzen, durch den \nRing eines gesund und fit gehaltenen K\u00f6rpers, der d ie Gef\u00e4hrdung abwehrt, dem ein bestimmtes Ma\u00df an \nBewegung und Entspannung zuzuf\u00fchren ist, des weiter en durch den Ring einer konkreten Lebenswelt im \nSch\u00fctzschen Sinne, d.h. durch eine Kette vertrauter , naheliegender und intimer Dinge, durch Verhaltens weisen \nund Gewohnheiten, in denen die konkrete T\u00e4tigkeit, das Zusammensein mit Freunden, die Beziehung, die \nNat\u00fcrlichkeit neue Rollen spielen. Es sind Welten, die Inkongruenzen und damit Stre\u00dfgef\u00e4hrdung abweise n.\u201c   \n519  Gunther Gebauer still sees the fit body as \u201ca kind of fortress. Like an armor, its task is to protect the person \nfrom sickness, aging, loss of attractiveness, incom petence. Skin, muscles, hair are honed for the defe nse against \nevery possible threat to the person. The hardness o f the armor also wards off the socially undesirable , locks out \neverything that one is not, to which one does not w ant to belongs \u2013 the fat, the flabby, the flaccid, as well as the \nfeatures of other social groups or classes with whi ch one does not want to be associated.\u201d  Gebauer, Gunther, \nop. cit., p. 89. 143 \n \nAs a context, we must understand that there are fou r major types of these \u201ctechnologies,\u201d \neach a matrix of practical reason: (1) technologies  of production, which permit us to produce, \ntransform, or manipulate things; (2) technologies o f sign systems, which permit us to use \nsigns, meanings, symbols, or signification; (3) tec hnologies of power, which determine the \nconduct of individuals and submit them to certain e nds or domination, an objectivizing of the \nsubject; (4) technologies of the self, which permit  individuals to effect by their own means or \nwith the help of others a certain number of operati ons on their own bodies and souls, \nthoughts, conduct, and way of being, so as to trans form themselves in order to attain a \ncertain state of happiness, purity, wisdom, perfect ion, or immortality. 520  \n \nIndeed, the HLTs engendered by fitness and wellness  clearly participate in an ideology of \nproduction, transformation and manipulation of phys ical capital. 521  This can also be \nunderstood in the Bourdieusian sense of embodied ca pital. As briefly mentioned in Chapter \n2 ( Methodology ), Bourdieu distinguished between three main forms of capitals: economic, \nsocial and cultural. The cultural category he then subdivided into embodied, objectified and \ninstitutionalised. He saw embodied capital as the c onsciously acquired as well the passively \n\u201cinherited\u201d properties of the self. 522  Building on the notion of \u201cembodied capital\u201d initi ally \ndeveloped by Bourdieu and later Chris Shilling, 523  Wolf-Dietrich Brett and Hans Peter Brandl-\nBredenbeck show how the notion of embodied capital as bodily performance is currently if \nnot eclipsed at least supplemented by other dimensi ons, such as a youthfulness, dynamism, \nsportiness, attractiveness etc. that facilitate the  conversion of embodied capital into other \nforms of capital. 524  But, to come back to Foucault, HLTs also draw upon and create a complex \nand extensive web of signs \u2013already partially discu ssed in Chapter 3 ( Theory ) but which will \nbe further illustrated in Chapters 5 ( Food Case-Study ) and 6 ( Cosmetics Case-study ). Finally, \nthey are situated at the crossroads between a contr olling or disciplining impulse that tends \nto objectify the body both aesthetically and functi onally (especially fitness) and an \nopportunity for a holistic if commodified self-(re) creation (particularly wellness).  \n \nIn this chapter, I therefore hope to have convincin gly demonstrated the profound \nambivalence characterising the fitness and wellness  ideologies \u2013hence also that of the \nproducts, services and practices (what I have label led as HLTs) they have generated. By \nmeans of a concise historical overview, I have atte mpted to show that if preoccupations with \nbodily design, productivity and self-fulfilment are  not modern phenomena, the industrial \nrevolution and its repercussions have conspired to radically alter the relationship between \nbodies and technology. In this paradigm, the body o scillates between a number of roles: a \nphysically and emotionally burnt-out victim of the conveyor belt tyranny (as a by-product of \n                                                 \n520  Technologies of the Self: A seminar with Michel Fou cault , op. cit., p. 18. \n521  Cf. Maguire, Jennifer Smith, op. cit., p. 59: \u201cInvestments in self-presentation \u2013 through fitness  activities, as \nwell as dieting, cosmetic surgery, fashion and so f orth \u2013 can thus be understood as modes of developin g one\u2019s \nphysical capital in order to improve one\u2019s exchange  value\u201d .  \n522  Cf. Cf. Bourdieu, Pierre , La distinction. Critique sociale du jugement , op. cit. \n523  Shilling shows how physical capital can be convert ed into the French sociologist\u2019s initial categories  of social, \neconomic or cultural capital but beyond that, how t hese forms of capital are necessarily embodied. Cf.  Shilling, \nChris, \u201cEducating the body: physical capital and th e production of social inequalities\u201d, Sociology , vol. 25, no. 4, \n01.11.1991, pp.  653-672. For an apt exposition of this concept in t he realm of sport, cf. Light, Richard, \u201cThe \nBody in the Social World and the Social World in th e Body: Applying Bourdieu's Work to Analyses of Phy sical \nActivity in Schools\u201d, online article: http://www.aare.edu.au/01pap/lig01450.htm .

Even if their analysi s is primarily premised upon young people, to my mi nd, it can \nbe extended to older generations. 144 \n \nmodern efficiency), a machine in its own right (pot entially benefiting from the same \nrationalised resources as its industrial oppressor,  i.e. electricity, radium, appropriate \nergonomics, etc.) and a \u201cnatural\u201d self-regenerating  essence capable of escaping or \nsubverting the \u201cartificial\u201d industrial order. Final ly, I have shown how the sedentary \naftermath of the industrial revolution, has turned this body-technology nexus upon its head \nsince it locates bodies at the intersection between  perniciously passive and regeneratively \nactive technologies that definitively blur the boun daries between subject and object, inside \nand outside, work and leisure, nature and technolog y, physics and aesthetics, while \nreinstating individuals\u2019 full responsibility in the  production and preservation of health. In this \nsense then, fitness and wellness can definitely be viewed as a new form of internalised \nlifestyle discrimination embedded in the logic of l ate modern production and \nconsumption.525  \n \nIt is this trajectory of internalising self-discipl ine which I would like to examine in the \nfollowing case-studies, Chapter 5 ( Food case-study ) and Chapter 6 ( Cosmetics case-study ), by \nconcretely focusing on the discursive negotiation o f health, beauty and well-being \nimperatives as they pertain to food and cosmetics d uring the last two decades of the 20 th  \ncentury. I have chosen to analyse discourse around food and cosmetics because these two \ndomains display a shift in the tension between insi de and out, as well as between deep and \nsuperficial action and transformation. Indeed, over  time, even if the ingestion of suitable \nfoods is seen as one of the main tools to sustain t he health of the metabolism and hence \nalso manage appropriate physical space \u2013and, more g enerally, appearance\u2013 it is increasingly \npushed as a mood and mind enhancer. Conversely, cos metics are primarily geared at \nsupporting external appearance since they are mainl y focused on the skin. But since the skin \nis the body\u2019s largest and most ubiquitous organ, it  also represents a particularly revealing \nreflection of bodily age and inner imbalances. So s imilarly to food, cosmetics are increasingly \nmediated as contributing not only to the physiology  of the skin but also to the maintenance \nof identity, youth and a healthful appearance. \n \nThus, as we shall see, although both food and cosme tics decisively contribute to appearance \nand health, they do so in very different ways. Food \u2019s contribution is perceived as indirect: \nover the two decades under consideration, a number of dimensions are still being actively \nnegotiated. Indulgence is pitted against duty, conv enience against naturalness and modern \nhealthfulness against traditional wholesomeness. Mo reover, the effect of these dimensions \non the body only becomes increasingly explicit \u2013if still controversial\u2013 towards the end of the \nperiod analysed. In the case of cosmetics, the link  between use and effect is perceived as \nmuch more direct: the skin must imperatively look g ood since it is one of the pillars of \nimpression management. Here, performance is of the essence and no ideological \ncompromises can be made: authentic nature is techno logically produced. 526   \n \nIn sum, both domains become indispensable tools to reveal and fashion identities and \nlifestyles, thus belying the classical proverb \u201cBeauty is only skin deep\u201d  and with a much less \n                                                 \n525  As Heiko Stoff pointedly puts it: \u201eDer Konsumk\u00f6rper ist weder heroisch noch utopisch,  er ist nicht verbessert, \nsondern nur optimiert und verschiedenen Formen der Normalisierung unterworfen.

We land on the moon. \nComputers are a matter of course, technical resourc es in the home as well. Indeed, we are \nmodern. But we still feed ourselves as if we were h eavy workers. And that makes us sluggish. \nTherefore to remain flexible, we must change our ha bits. We must compensate for a mainly \nsedentary job and eat less \u201cheavily\u201d. Instead we mu st eat food that is richer in minerals, \nvitamins and protein. 528  \n \nThe brilliant wellness-couple: yogurt plus aloe ver a. With them, it is now really easy to bring \nmore energy and happiness into your life. Aloe is a  first step and yogurt a further one. So just \nbegin the day with Emmi ALOE VERA SENSITIVE YOGURT,  do yourself a favour, replenish \nyourself with vitality and wellness. 529    \n \nIntroduction \nAt face value, the contrast between consuming cotta ge cheese in the early 1980s and eating \nyogurt in the early 2000s could hardly be greater. Both experiences seem to have been \nengineered in radically different ways. The jocca  quote emphasises technology, rationality \nand modernity in the management of food and the ton e is so admonishing as to border on \nthe moralising. 530  Cottage cheese in this context is seen as a tool t o maintain fitness. On the \nother side of the spectrum, the Emmi quote focuses almost exclusively on emotion and wel l-\nbeing and its tone is much more suggestive than imp erative. Here the yogurt has acquired \nthe status of an ally, it is personified to the poi nt of becoming \u201csensitive\u201d, suggesting that it \nwill adapt to the individual consumer\u2019s emotional s tate. It would thus be tempting to \nsimplify the trajectory of food culture mediation i n the course of these two decades by \nstating that discourse on food evolves from a highl y didactic and normative stance to a much \nmore wishy-washy feel-good rhetoric. But even if th is evolution reflects the dominant trend, \nit obscures the fact that just as holistic dimensio ns are present very early on, disciplinary \nattitudes towards food consumption do not disappear  over time but are packaged in an \n                                                 \n528  Excerpt from an ad for Kraft\u2019s jocca  cottage cheese in freundin , Heft 3, 1980:  \u201eWir haben 1980.

[websites accessed Aug. 2011] \n530  Modernity in this discourse is explicitly tied to technological milestones: landing on the moon, the \ndissemination of computers (although they are not y et that self-evident in everyday working life) and the \n\u201cautomation\u201d of the home. Interestingly though, it points to the cultural time lag between the penetra tion or \ndissemination of technologies and their cultural ap propriation in the sense of evolving habits. Sluggi shness is \npictured as the fruit of this lag and lighter food as the redemption. But this redemption is based on a \ntheoretical understanding that consumers are no lon ger \u201cheavy-workers\u201d.  147 \n \nincreasingly subtle coating of healthy indulgence \u2013  as I\u2019m about to demonstrate in the \nfollowing examples.  \n \nBut before analysing contemporary sources, I would like to clarify the aims of this case-\nstudy. Indeed, against the backdrop of a booming fo od history production \u2013especially from a \nhistory of technology perspective, I feel the need to methodologically demarcate my \nendeavour. 531  As stated in Chapter 2 ( Methodology ), I exclusively focus on a media discourse \nanalysis, i.e. on the basis of feature articles and  advertising mainly drawn from so-called \n\u201clifestyle magazines\u201d, I examine how the discourse on food has evolved over the last two \ndecades of the 20 th  century and how it has contributed to the negotiat ion of \u201chealthy \nlifestyle\u201d representations. In this respect, my stu dy is not directly concerned with the de \nfacto evolving consumption of various foodstuffs du ring this time span, 532  even if many of \nthe articles I quote allude to statistics that seem  to confirm what might otherwise be lightly \ndismissed as inflated media trends. Instead, I wish  to draw attention to the historically \nrecurring rationales that in turn celebrate and ana themise particular foods, diets and the \nlifestyles they more or less explicitly emblematise . In this respect, the cultural negotiation of \n\u201chealthy\u201d versus \u201cunhealthy\u201d and its correlates is certainly one of the most striking \nphenomena:  \n \nWhat was considered physiologically superfluous dec ades ago \u2013such as dietary fibre\u2013 is now \njudged absolutely necessary in a physiologically ap propriate diet. What was healthy \nyesterday is condemned as unhealthy today. Why? Rig ht or wrong, healthy or unhealthy, \nnatural or artificial are cultural definitions that  only approximately match biological \nrequirements, but never directly respond to natural  demands. Indeed, there are no inborn \nmechanisms which ensure that human beings eat healt hily. When they consciously do so \u2013as \nfar as they are able to\u2013 they leave the natural sph ere and already move into the cultural \none. 533   \n                                                 \n531  In the introduction to a special issue on food and  nutrition of the Technikgeschichte  journal, Karin Zachmann \nprovides a nice and compact overview of the history  of food and diets from this perspective, cf. Zachm ann, \nKarin, \u201eEinleitung\u201c, Technikgeschichte , Bd 78, Heft 3, 2011, pp. 175-185. Footnote 11 pro vides a number of \nseminal bibliographical references on the technolog isation of food. \n532  To do this would require accessing a much broader variety of sources such as e.g. the \u201cErn\u00e4hrungsberi chte\u201d \npublished every four years by the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrung  or the \u201cNationale Verzehrstudien I & II\u201d \n[mid-1980s and mid-2000s respectively] commissioned  by the Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrung, \nLandwirtschaft und Verbraucherschutz , that provide concrete insights into German food c onsumption and diet \nlinked to socio-economic, epidemiological and envir onmental considerations. Moreover, to my mind, doin g \njustice to these sources would require overstretchi ng the aims and boundaries of an already substantia l study.  \n533  Barl\u00f6sius, Eva, Soziologie des Essens: eine sozial e und kulturwissenschaftliche Einf\u00fchrung in die \nErn\u00e4hrungsforschung, Weinheim & M\u00fcnchen: Juventa Ve rlag, 1999, p. 37: \u201eWas vor Jahrzehnten als k\u00f6rperlich \n\u00fcberfl\u00fcssig bewertet wurde, wie die \u201eBallaststoffe\u201c , wird seit einigen Jahren als unbedingt erforderli ch f\u00fcr eine \nk\u00f6rperlich angemessene Ern\u00e4hrung beurteilt.

Richtig oder verkehrt, gesund oder ungesund,  naturgem\u00e4\u00df oder unnat\u00fcrlich sind kulturelle \nFestlegungen, die den biologischen Anforderungen im mer nur n\u00e4herungsweise entsprechen, aber nie \nunmittelbar auf die Naturgebundenheit reagieren.

Indeed, the publication of a report by the \nGerman Nutrition Society [DGE: Deutsche Gesellschaf t f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrung] in 1980 triggers a \nnumber of articles that dissect the German populati on\u2019s allegedly appalling nutritional \nhabits:  \n \nAn increasing number of Germans are eating themselv es to death. More than half die of \nnutrition-related diseases. This was revealed in th e newest nutrition report ordered by the \nFederal Ministries of Health and Food from the Germ an Nutrition Society. Germans eat too \nmuch fat, drink too much alcohol, do not know enoug h about appropriate diet \u2013 and are \noverweight. [\u2026] The mortality rate linked to nutrit ion-related diseases has never been as high \nas today. 55 per cent of Germans die of heart and d igestion diseases as well as diabetes \nmellitus (50 years ago: 16 per cent). Since 1952, t he incidence of heart disease has met with \na 227 per cent increase. 534  \n \nProfessor Werner K\u00fcbler from Gie\u00dfen University trac es this rather sobering state of affairs \nback to the increase in animal fats and the decreas e in mineral-rich foods within the typical \nGerman diet, even if the total energy ingested from  food sources has remained unchanged \nfor the past seven decades. 535  In terms of concrete nutritional habits, shopping is still largely \nperformed by women (75%) mainly in supermarkets (52 %) and they buy \u201cless potatoes, \nlegumes, cereals and milk but more fruit, vegetable s, cheese, eggs, meat (pork) and poultry.\u201d \nThree meals a day are still the rule but there is a  trend towards the recommended five. Stew \n[Eintopf] and the Sunday roast are still once-a-wee k staples and soup features regularly in \nthe diet of a quarter of the population. 536  But what worries most authors is the widespread \nnutritional ignorance of the German population: \n \nAlmost two thirds of homemakers still have no idea about the calorie requirements for an \nadult. And more than half do not know what calorie means, but are aware that joule has \nreplaced the calorie concept. Three quarters of the  population still believes that margarine \ncontains less fat than butter. 537   \n \n                                                                                                                                                         \nselbst bestimmen und schaffen.\u201c For more insights into the entanglement of nature a nd culture in the food \nrealm, cf. also B\u00f6hme, Gernot, Leibsein als Aufgabe: Leibphilosophie in pragmatisc her Hinsicht , op. cit., pp. 261-\n291 (\u201cStoffwechsel\u201d).   \n534  Reinhardt, Karl-Walter, \u201eImmer mehr Deutsche schau feln sich beim Essen ein fr\u00fches Grab\u201c, Die Welt , 29.

Und die H\u00e4lfte wei\u00df nicht was unter Ka lorien zu verstehen ist, wohl aber, dass Joule den Begriff \nKalorie abgel\u00f6st hat. Drei Viertel der Bev\u00f6lkerung glaubt immer noch Margarine sei fett\u00e4rmer als Butte r.\u201c   149 \n \nAnother article goes even further by affirming that  \u201c[m]ost citizens are not really aware of \nwhat they are eating. They only make a superficial distinction between good and evil: \nprotein, vitamin C, fruit and vegetables are health y; overweight, fat and calories are \nunhealthy.\u201d 538  Consequently, this ignorance is exploited by manufa cturers to lend a better \nimage to their products. 539  But significantly enough, the already mentioned Pr ofessor K\u00fcbler \nsuggests a \u201cfunctionalising\u201d of food to compensate for vitamin and mineral deficiencies \u2013as \npractised by Americans and Israelis. But the author  of the article remains sceptical: \u201conly \ntime will tell if adding vitamins to pretzel sticks  and raspberry ice-cream will really better \ncompensate for nutrient deficiency in children, ado lescents and women than a complex \ndiet.\u201d 540  On the basis of recent studies and statistics, the  journalist Stefan Gergely goes even \nfurther in the analysis of Germans\u2019 reticence to bo th lose weight and eat more healthily:  \n \nSo many just do not want to admit that they are ove rweight, and when they do admit it, they \nare not interested in the health aspect of nutritio n: this aspect is clearly secondary for the \nmajority of Germans \u2013 for 70 percent of them food r epresents pleasure. Even if taste and \nhealth imperatives were irreconcilable, 46 per cent  would opt for the tasty and only 26 per \ncent for the healthy meal. 541  \n \nSo what appears to be a cognitive dissonance is in fact rooted in a conscious choice: pleasure \nover healthfulness. Of course, consumers\u2019 warped bo dy image is no doubt also powered by \nthe increasingly negative social perception of obes ity. But the main motivation to slim is \naesthetic rather than health-oriented, especially i n the case of women. Hence, even if the \nyounger generation no longer believes that children  ought to \u201click their platters clean\u201d, \nenergy intake is not (yet) influenced by better kno wledge. Therefore, the ascetic guidelines \nof health apostles do not seem to influence the pop ulation and comfort foods and drinks \n[Genussmittel] are perceived as a necessary ill (or  happiness technique) to counter the stress \nof everyday life. 542   \n \n1980-1982: Traditional indulgence or slim disciplin e?  \nThis state of affairs is strikingly reflected in th e bicephalous trend championed by the \nlifestyle press of the day \u2013be in terms of feature articles or advertisements for food \nproducts. Indeed, there is a palpable tension betwe en a traditional \u201ccomfort\u201d food \norientation and a more rational \u201chealthful\u201d approac h. At first glance however, from our \n                                                 \n538  Elvers, Karin, op. cit.: \u201eDie meisten B\u00fcrger wissen nicht genau, wass sie es sen.

For \nexample, a Brigitte  magazine feature entitled \u201cWhat are we eating today?\u201d  includes recipes \nfor smoked pork in a juniper and cream sauce, a pot ato and herring salad, Brussels sprouts \nwith bacon or green cabbage with sausage dumplings.543  Starches are overwhelmingly \nprovided by potatoes and a number of dumpling varia tions. And although rice and pasta are \nstaples, they are not as common as they will become  later and they rarely appear as the \nbasis of self-contained dishes (such as e.g. paella  or pasta al pesto) 544  but instead as a rather \nbland starch complementing meat and vegetables. As to vegetables, preferences still seem \nto go towards the cabbage family \u2013often in the guis e of sauerkraut but also cauliflower or \nBrussels sprouts\u2013 as well as onions, cucumber, gher kins, carrots and other root vegetables. \nThe most common fruits are apples, pears, oranges a nd berries. Exotic touches are provided \nby e.g. olives (usually as an appetizer) or fruit s uch as bananas, coconut or pineapple in \nsalads or sauces. Most menus include elaborate dess erts such as rich layered cakes or special \nchilled creams and ice-creams.  \n \nEven supposedly summery or light dishes may strike our contemporary sensitivities as rather \nstodgy. For example, under the title \u201cLight dishes that are easy to digest after the hol iday \nsplurge\u201d , an ad for Pfanni  presents a selection of dishes prepared with its c onvenience \ndumpling mixes or potato specialities. Alongside su ch feather-light delights as r\u00f6sti (Swiss \nFarmer-style roasted potatoes) with fried eggs or F ranconian style stew with roasted meat \nsausage, one also finds an interesting recipe label led \u201cBohemian dumplings with \u2018Hawaii\u2019 \ngoulash and green beans\u201d  \u2013 the \u201cHawaiian\u201d touch being provided by pineapple  and \npineapple juice. 545  In terms of exotic ingredients, most of them are p rovided by European \nneighbours reputed for their solid food. Indeed, Ru ssian-style gherkins, creamy French \ncheeses and mustard, Hungarian salami or Dutch Goud a feature prominently. Similarly, the \ncooking feature \u201cThe new cuisine\u201d  in Frau im Spiegel  presents an article on \u201cexotic\u201d food \nentitled \u201cSpicy vegetables from distant lands\u201d . The recipes however are neither South \nAfrican nor Indian since distant lands are represen ted by France (ratatouille), Italy (stuffed \nzucchini with ginger sauce) and the Canary Islands (fennel Las Palmas). 546  \n \nAdvertisements for staple industrial food products generally reflect the above-mentioned \n\u201cheavy and traditional\u201d trends: full fat cheeses an d cream, convenience potato specialities, \ncanned sauerkraut and bottled gherkins, butter, mar garine, cooking oils and fats star \nregularly. But interestingly, one can already detec t a fundamental ambivalence in the \nadvertisements for various types of lipids. Palmin , for instance is praised as \u201e100% taste \nneutral\u201c  so that \u201emeat tastes of meat, not fat\u201c  and is presented by butcher Jan-Jakob Harms \nfrom Hamburg against a background featuring large s labs of meat hanging from hooks, \nalongside a small portrait of a real old style roas t with a thick layer of fat \u2013a setting that \n                                                 \n543  \u201eWas essen wir heute?\u201c, Brigitte , Heft 1, 1980, p. 97: \u201eKasseler in Wacholdersahne\u201c; \u201eKartoffel-Herings-\nSalat\u201c; \u201eRosenkohl mit Speck\u201c; \u201eGr\u00fcnkohl mit Bratwu rstkl\u00f6\u00dfchen\u201c. \n544  Cf. a few exceptions such as \u201eReis: Die besten Spe zialit\u00e4ten aus f\u00fcnf L\u00e4nder\u201c, F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 23, 26/10/80, p. \n183: \u201eZaubern Sie doch einmal tolle Gerichte mit dem ber \u00fchmstesten Korn der Welt.

The most important risk factors are heav y smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, \noverweight and especially a high cholesterol level,  as is already the case for approx. 30% of \nour adult population. Hereditary factors, on which we have no influence, should also be \nconsidered. How can we live more reasonably? There is a whole range of measures. We \nshould e.g. smoke less and move more. We can positi vely influence an increased cholesterol \nlevel by eating little fat and by paying attention to a balanced ratio of saturated and \npolyunsaturated fatty acids in our food. When overw eight, we should also consume fewer \ncalories. What role can nutrition play? Our affluen t diet generally contains too much fat, \nespecially saturated fat, but too little linoleic a cids. This is why our diets contribute to \nincrease the cholesterol level. And this can lead t o arteriosclerotic heart and circulation \ndamage. [\u2026] Eating more consciously because it is r easonable: becel is part of it. 549  \n \nThus, the contemporary increase in civilisation dis eases in industrialised countries is \ndenounced before cholesterol is singled out for spe cial management. Interestingly, \ncivilisation diseases are implicitly considered as multi-factorial since a holistic approach \u2013\ninvolving smoke reduction, movement and diet\u2013 is ad vocated as the best strategy. Even \nthough the actual health explanations are rather sk etchy, they still presuppose a certain \nfamiliarity with terms such as \u201ccholesterol\u201d, \u201csatu rated and polyunsaturated fatty acids\u201d or \n\u201carteriosclerotic\u201d \u2013be it only as buzzwords. 550  Just as in the jocca  ad I used as an introductory \n                                                 \n547  Ad for Dr Schlink\u2019s Palmin [surprisingly not made out of palm oil but 100% coconut fat!] ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 8, \n1980). \n548  Ad for Biskin Fett und \u00d6l ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 5, 1980).  \n549  Ads for becel Di\u00e4t-Speise\u00f6l, -Margarine, -Planzenc reme ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 1, 1979 or Frau im Spiegel , Heft 25, \n1980): \u201eIn allen hochindustrialisierten L\u00e4ndern Europas ha ben Herz- und Kreislaufkrankheiten st\u00e4ndig \nzugenommen.

Wir sollten z.B. weniger rauchen und uns m ehr \nbewegen. Den erh\u00f6hten Cholesterinspiegel k\u00f6nnen wir  g\u00fcnstig beeinflussen, indem wir weniger Fett essen  und \ndabei auf ein ausgewogenes Verh\u00e4ltnis von ges\u00e4ttigt en und mehrfach unges\u00e4ttigten Fetts\u00e4uren in unserer  \nNahrung achten.

Surprisingly, even ads for convenience food such as Pfanni  potato \nspecialties stress \u201ca modern and rational diet\u201d , including vitamins and minerals 551 .   \n \nOtherwise, ease and time saving in general seem to be gaining in popularity due to what is \nperceived as a hectic modern lifestyle. However, re sorting to convenience food in daily \ncooking still seems to require elaborate justificat ions, as obvious from the rhetoric of an ad \ndesigned by the German fish industry [Fischwirtscha ft]: \n \nFrozen fish means you never get in a stew. If somet hing interrupts your shopping \u2013for \nexample a particularly attractive special offer\u2013 or  if you once have to stay longer at work, \nfrozen fish helps you avoid embarrassment quickly a nd elegantly. It only requires a short \ndefrosting and is ready in a flash \u2013 and with a lit tle love and fantasy, fish fingers or frozen fish \nfillets are far from being just a stopgap solution.  Indeed they become a meal that appeals to \nthe whole family. 552  \n \nIn fact taking the \u201cconvenient\u201d way out with frozen  fish appears tantamount to a \u201cnurturing \nbetrayal\u201d that can only be justified by emphasising  the duties and temptations of working \nwomen, as characteristic of a mass-consumption soci ety. 553  Similarly, in order to justify \nconsuming cottage cheese as a regular and ubiquitou s snack,  Kraft  \u2013in another ad for jocca \u2013 \ndramatises the rhythms of modern corporate life, by  emphasising the fact that performance \nis even required in the field of nutrition:  \n \nYou have to be fully present all day long. Do you a lso apply this to mealtimes? Corporate \nexecutives are expected to stay mentally fit and ac tive every day for twelve or more hours. \nBut most don\u2019t live up to it.

Most of them \nare promoted along traditional lines such as e.g. St. Gero  that bears the usual stamp \n\u201cmineral spring recognised by the state\u201d and is supposed to support digestive functions and \nthus help the body to get rid of waste and poisons.556  The bottle is pictured against a \nmedieval illumination background no doubt represent ing the monk-saint holding a book. But \nads for other mineral waters such as e.g. Heppinger take a totally different tack. The \nbackground here is a pretty and slim young woman in  a leotard kneeling in a yogic position \nwith hands extended. The caption states: \u201cTreat your body to something good. Heppinger \nmineral water\u201d.  Even if the rationale invoked to drink it is still  very specifically physiological, \na small sentence suggests \u201cand because it tastes so good, one could almost fo rget how \nhealthy it is\u201d .557  Another ad for the mineral water shows a similar l ooking model also clad in \na leotard engaging in a series of yogic positions \u2013 which, it should be noted, are just \ndescribed as gymnastics\u2013 with a small commentary in dicating the effect of the particular \nposition. For instance, in the one where the model lies on the ground with her lower body \nand legs bent back over her head (in an s-shaped po sition), the caption states: \u201cactivates \nbreathing, stimulates the metabolism\u201d . The header above the woman spells: \u201cCan one \nactivate the metabolism in 5 minutes, transform gre y skin into a rosy complexion and feel \nenergetic or very, very calm \u2013at will? Yes with Hep pinger music gymnastics\u201d . A coupon then \nadvertises a brochure with two tapes to accompany t his \u201crevolutionary balancing \ngymnastics\u201d  \u2013an interesting and rather puzzling way to introdu ce a yoga-type practice, or \nmaybe a strategy to jazz/disco-up a discipline that  may already have lost some of its appeal \nin the early 1980s. 558  Even though overlapping holistic practices are not  clearly enunciated as \na means to maintain or promote health, these ads ar e certainly forerunners of the more \nexplicitly wellness ads to be found increasingly to wards the end of the decade.  \n \nLight sodas have also begun to appear on the market . Di\u00e4t [diet] Fanta , for example, is \nadvertised with the picture of a giant bottle behin d which a woman is almost entirely \nconcealed (but we can still see that she is slim an d that she is wearing a swimsuit and \nsummery sandals): she just \u201cpeekabooes\u201d with an all uring look below the following caption: \n\u201cThis is the new Di\u00e4t Fanta with which you indulge yourself in slimful fun.

[emphasis in original] \n555  In all the jocca ads though there is a sense of im perative urgency: one is made to feel that the heal th of the \nnation is rapidly declining, that overall weight is  soaring and that personal responsibility must be t aken to halt \nthis dangerous progression. Interestingly, in all t he jocca ads, there is no detectable gender specifi city in the \ndiscourse, perhaps betraying the more Americanised \u201cpublic-health\u201d style of a big food multinational.  \n556  Ad for St.Gero \u201estaatlich anerkannte Heilquelle\u201c  (Frau im Spiegel , Heft 37, 1982).  \n557  Ad for Heppinger, Frau im Spiegel , Heft 38, 1982: \u201eTun Sie Ihrem K\u00f6rper etwas Gutes.

And few calories.\u201d 559  The soda is sweetened with  saccharin, \ncyclamate and fructose and is officially targeted a t consumers suffering from diabetes and \noverweight \u2013as footnoted\u2013 but the iconography seems  to clearly emphasise all women\u2019s \nslimming mission. deit , a light lemonade in three varieties, displays a s imilar bias despite the \nsmall print that focuses on weight reduction for bo th diabetics and horizontally-challenged \nindividuals. Indeed, an almost headless woman holds  up a glass of lemonade with a straw to \nher painted lips with a perfectly manicured hand. A nd the glass has printed markings \ndisplaying the calorie contents of various beverage s according to their volume. The scale \nranges from super calorific whisky (125 kcal for 50  ml) to sweet sherry, sparkling wine, stout, \napple juice, buttermilk and deit with lemon juice ( 5 kcal for 200ml). And the caption \nreinforces the message with: \u201cThe slim pleasure with the least calories. deit\u00ae i nternational: \nso that thirst doesn\u2019t make you fat.\u201d The sweetener is not mentioned here but the text \nstates that the drink has been produced exclusively  with natural and mineral water \nsources. 560  \n \nActually, artificial sweeteners represent a real bo om in the 1980s: Assugrin , Natreen  and \nTeekanne \u2019s S\u00fcssFix  seem to hold the upper hand on the market. But all  of them still seem to \nrequire elaborate explanations. 561  For instance, ads for Assugrin  portray either the small \ncubes or the liquid version. The first ad portrays a variety of coffee specialties such as \nTurkish mocha or Irish coffee and the second displa ys a number of sweets \u2013from cocktails, to \njelly, fruit desserts, pancakes, pies and a fruit &  rice salad. But both ads are captioned as \nfollows: \u201cSweeten better with a good conscience. The days of  \u201csweet guilt\u201d are now over. \nIndeed, sweetening with Assugrin means better sweet ening: without calories and \ncarbohydrates [\u2026] Assugrin makes everything delight fully sweet. Like with sugar; but without \naftertaste and without burdening [\u2026] Assugrin is th e ideal sweetener for modern cooking.\u201d 562  \nThis type of rhetoric is typical of slimming produc ts, since it tends to oscillate between a \ncommanding moralising tone and a more apologetic, r edeeming touch.  \n \nNatreen  also offers both sweetener variations alongside ad ditional products, such as jams, \nfruit spread, an orange drink and a diet dessert (w ith strawberry aroma). But instead of a \ndiabetic target audience, the caption \u2013which remain s the same in all the ads\u2013 primarily \naddresses overweight individuals in need of nutriti onal guidance:  \n \nMany overweight individuals not only eat too much, they also eat the wrong way. Indeed, \none should opt for 5 to 6 small meals a day instead  of 3 large ones. Also, avoid readily \nassimilated carbohydrates, as they are normally fou nd in sweetened foods, because these \n                                                 \n559  Ad for Di\u00e4t Fanta , Brigitte, Heft 15, 1980 : \u201eDas ist die neue Di\u00e4t Fanta, mit der Sie sich de n Spa\u00df schlankweg \nerlauben k\u00f6nnen.

Cf. \nDe la Pe\u00f1a, Carolyn Th., Empty Pleasures: the story of artificial sweeteners  from Saccharin to Splenda , Chapel \nHill [NC], University of North Carolina Press, 2010 .  \n562  Ads for Assugrin, Brigitte , Heft 5 & 20, 1980 or F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 5, 1980: \u201e Mit gutem Gewissen besser s\u00fc\u00dfen.

The model is slim b ut not as anorexic as her mid- to late \n1990s counterparts. The caption is a play on words since it states that \u201cS\u00fcssFix macht s\u00fcss\u201d  \n[The meaning in German is both: S\u00fcssfix sweetens an d makes (you) sweet]. Here, the dieting \ndiscourse is much less present: instead it transpir es in the design of the container that shows \na stylised hourglass figure. 564  Another type of sweetener, the hybrid flaromleicht  (\u201clight \nsweetness\u201d ) contains mainly fructose as well as saccharin and  cyclamate and is processed \ninto granules similar to sugar. The layout combines  both sweet foodstuffs and \u201clight\u201d people: \na jumping man, an elegant woman dancing and a still  unusual sight: a woman jogger. 565  \n \nLater in the decade, artificial sweeteners begin to  appear in other slimming products such as \ndesserts, fruit drinks or chewing gum. Orbit  chewing gum is actually an interesting example. \nThe ads display women in sporty outfits (swimmer, t ennis player, biker, fencer). Significantly, \nthe fencer states: \u201cSport alone is not enough... Of course I love to f ence, since both I and my \nfigure find it fun. But to remain really fit, one m ust do a bit more. Therefore I also pay \nattention to my figure while eating. I now often le ave out a small meal and have a chewing \ngum instead in-between.\u201d 566  Hence, just as health, slimness requires a multi-s trategy \napproach. Appropriate food combined with sport seem s to represent an increasingly popular \nway to fight the flab as demonstrated by Ellen Wess inghage, a former German runner, who \nstill does not have problems with her weight. The a d for B\u00e4renmarke \u2019s Die leichte 4 , a coffee \ncream with only 4% fat, is divided into two narrow photographs on both sides of a double \npage. The first page shows the athlete running \u2013in a sweat-shirt and shorts revealing her slim \nmuscular legs\u2013 in a park-like setting under the cap tion \u201cStaying in shape\u2026\u201d , while the next \nphotograph shows her about to enjoy a nice cup of c offee: she is portrayed with a winning \nsmile, seated at table in \u201ccivilian\u201d clothes and ho lding a can of cream. The caption then \nreads: \u201c\u2026is a pleasure for me\u201d.\u201d 567  Slimming here is associated with an individualised  and \ndisciplined \u2013if fun\u2013 pursuit.  \n \nIn the early 1980s, other slimming foods are also b ecoming popular: Hipp ,568  for instance, \nunder the caption \u201cInstead of starving\u201d  provides convenience meals in seven variations wit h \n                                                 \n563  Ads for Natreen ( Frau im Spiegel , Heft 23, 1980, Brigitte , Heft 6, 1980, F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 4, 1980): \u201e Viele \n\u00dcbergewichtige essen nicht nur zu viel, sie essen a uch h\u00e4ufig verkehrt.

Cf.: http://www.hipp.de/index.php?id=19 . [website accessed Aug. 2011] 156 \n \na calorie content ranging from 213 to 276 kcal. Int erestingly, if it does suggest some \nalternative flavours to the regular German diet, it  still reflects rather solid tastes since the \ndishes include a Mexican casserole, chicken with ri ce and peas, Serbian meat rice, Old \nGerman chicken casserole, spicy chicken salad, beef  with a vegetable mix and veal dumplings \nwith vegetables in a cream sauce. 569  Apart from the incongruousness of dumplings and \ncream in our current representation of diet fare, t wo aspects are striking and point towards \na fundamental shift in dietary consumption and the influence it will have on the general diet: \nif meat is still pre-eminently present, chicken \u2013as  a lean flesh- is gradually eclipsing red \nmeats, just as rice seems to be replacing potatoes as a slimming staple. Indeed, both \ningredients are present in three of the seven dishe s on offer.   \n \nIndividual dietary discipline, this time directed n ot just at sports enthusiasts or professionals, \nis perhaps most convincingly encapsulated in the di scourse surrounding Du darfst [you may], \na product line offering ingredients that are tradit ionally considered fattening \u2013such as jam, \nmargarine or cheese\u2013 in a slimming version under th e motto \u201ceating made-to-order\u201d. The \naccompanying text emphasises individuality again an d again through the repetition of \u201cI\u201d, \n\u201cmyself\u201d and \u201cme\u201d in contrast with the brand-name \u201c you may\u201d: \u201cI want to stay as I am\u2026 \n\u2026and I am not deluding myself: food does not make o ne slim. But I feed myself paying \nattention to calories and thus find it easier to re main in shape. \u201aDu darfst\u2019 suits me, tastes \ngood to me and agrees with me.\u201d570  Thus a significant dialectic is built that highlig hts the \ninternalisation of an outer imperative. If the stre ss here is not on a sporty lifestyle, the \nstriking aspect is that the model watching her refl ection as she walks by is not presented as \nan ex-obese (there is absolutely no intimation of a  before and after state). Instead it \nsuggests that all modern women should watch their w eight in order to remain as they are. \nThe slimming diktat is thus not based on a curative  but on a preventive model, rooted in an \nincreasingly hegemonic aesthetic representation of a womanhood that should remain \nforever young and slim. 571 \n  \nOther slimming foods include protein-rich drinks, p urees, porridges or mueslis. The discourse \nsurrounding all these products stresses the fact th at effective, healthy slimming should \nensure a sufficient intake of protein (THE panacea common to all these preparations) as well \nas dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals and should ensure that consumers remain fresh, \nenergetic and performing. The special formulation o f these products is supposed to spare \nconsumers the complicated maths involved in calcula ting adequate nutritional intake. 572  In \n                                                 \n569  Ad for Hipp Di\u00e4t ( Brigitte , Heft 20, 1980): \u201c Statt hungern\u201d  Interestingly, these meals can only be purchased \nin pharmacies, drugstores and healthfood shops. Thi s shows that many slimming aids are still viewed as  \ntherapeutic aids rather than regular food and it pr obably also entails that they are substantially mor e expensive \nthan supermarket food, hence not affordable for all  consumers. \n570  Ad for Du darfst product line ( Brigitte , Heft 15, 1980): \u201eEssen nach Ma\u00df\u201c, \u201eIch will so bleiben, wie ich bin\u2026 \n\u2026und ich mache mir nichts vor: Essen macht nun mal nicht schlank.

While this layout sugges ts that the target for a light margarine is to avoi d storing fat \naround the hip and thigh area, the strange \u201cvine le af\u201d strategy may suggest that overweight is linked to a \nfeeling of shame and maybe even a loss of sexual at tractiveness. This truncated photograph seems typic al of an \ninternalised male-oriented gaze on the female body:  it is not the overall harmony that counts but resp ecting \nthe societal norm for a particular area. \n572  Cf. e.g. an ad for bioNorm Eiwei\u00df Konzentrat, \u201e-Fl ocken, \u201e-M\u00fcsli, \u201e-Vielkorn, -Drinks ( Brigitte,  Heft 7, 1980). 157 \n \nthis instance, bioNorm 573  sets out to partially disqualify sports as a slimmi ng strategy in an ad \nfirst picturing a pair of trainers without any comm ent before stating the following:  \n \nCan one run away from one\u2019s excess weight? Running is healthy. Those who run or \u201cjog\u201d a lot \ndo their heart a favour, as well as their circulati on and performance. But that\u2019s not enough \nagainst overweight. The calories that you lose duri ng a solid half-hour of jogging are easily \nregained with a small bottle of beer. If you add a small handful of nuts, you should jog for a \nfurther half hour. Thus it is more effective to go on a diet.  574    \n \nThe ad goes to explain how bioNorm  products can contribute to a healthy weight loss b ut \ncautions with the following: \u201c Nevertheless: do not give up sport \u2013on the contrary , it supports \nand promotes weight loss. Besides their diet, those  who run or swim twice a week are more \nlikely to become slim and active. And to stay that way.\u201d 575  The interdependency of slimming \nstrategies is thus articulated in a more nuanced wa y than for other products. It also stands in \nsharp contrast to appetite suppressants \u2013a seemingl y flourishing market\u2013 that promise \nresults with much less effort: a reduced appetite w hilst preserving consumers\u2019 good mood, \nenergy and freedom of nutritional choice. But in th e case of suppressants, each ad displays a \nlong list of indications and rather disquieting sid e-effects such as nervousness, increased \nheartbeat, palpitations and sleep disorders as well  as many contraindications. 576  All ads are \nprimarily targeted at a feminine audience.

But  we believe that your discourse on ideal \nweight and calories is gradually reaching such prop ortions that we find it really shameless. \nHence, we would like to ask what your goal is? Inde ed, we find that it is an attempt to limit \npersonal freedom \u2013and this in a women\u2019s magazine! D o you find it a worthy aim to be \nplagued with a bad conscience after every little pi ece of chocolate ingested? In your case, the \nfollowing motto seems to apply: Man is allowed ever ything and woman nothing \u2013 for the \nbenefit of man? We would like to know if your reade rs also find that the ideal weight is a \nreliable indicator to judge the worth of a person. 579  \n \nIn their reply the editors try to uncomfortably squ irm their way out of the above accusations \nby stating that weight should not be used to judge an individual but they affirm that weight \nis a topic preoccupying a majority of the magazine\u2019 s readership (men included since it \nappears that diets are often followed by husbands a nd male friends). Moreover \u201ccalories\u201d \nand \u201cideal weight\u201d are viewed as indispensable info rmation in the realm of a slimming diet \u2013\nbut should not be interpreted as normative. 580  Nevertheless, the other concerns voiced \nunder the same \u201cReaders\u2019 Letters\u201d rubric seem to le nd additional \u201cweight\u201d to the two \nwomen\u2019s complaint, while indirectly paying tribute to the editors\u2019 assessment of women\u2019s \n\u201chunger\u201d for slimming:  from the woman who does not  want to drink just mineral water \nwhen she goes clubbing, through the one who is sear ching for a diet supplement that can \nmake her lose 6 kilos within 7 days (but the supple ment should be dosed so that she does \nnot crave sweets and her work does not suffer from it), to the woman who complains that \nshe can\u2019t get going without milky sweet coffee and wonders if milk and sugar boast that \nmany calories \u2013considering that every diet recommen ds avoiding coffee cream and using \nartificial sweeteners. 581  \n \n1983-1984: Foreign temptations and consumer educati on \nLater in the 1980s, recipes get a little lighter an d less traditional, especially in the summer \nmonths, e.g. \u201cscalloped fish fillets with celery\u201d , \u201ccold buttermilk and tomato soup\u201d and  \n                                                 \n579  \u201eFragen Sie freundin.

Indeed, a cooking \nfeature in Brigitte even openly insinuates vegetarian subversion in the  title \u201cMeatless \nHappiness: A new kind of celebration meal\u201d  before pursuing \u201cDid you notice? Only the festive \nroast is missing in this rich meal! But give it a t ry \u2013 even without meat there\u2019s no gaping hole \non the menu\u201d. 583  Buffets style meals also seem to be popular, signa lling a growing trend \ntowards a preparation that allows for more time spe nt with guests. 584  A festive late Spring \nmenu in Frau im Spiegel  features veal steaks with basil \u2013still apparently an exotic herb: \u201cIf \nyou aren\u2019t acquainted with it, you should try it be cause it really goes well with meat and \nvegetables\u201d . But the really unexpected touches are to be found  in the other courses, i.e. the \ntomato soup is prepared from a tin, just adding sli ced pears, honey and Grand Marnier as \nwell as a blob of whipped cream, the sorbets and \u201cg ranit\u00e9s\u201d are made out of coconut juice, \nBourgogne, kiwis and orange juice and the cake for the Kaffee-Kuchen [coffee and cake] \nafternoon ritual is a layered melon cake prepared w ith a cake mix. Surprisingly, in contrast \nwith former discourse on convenience foods and exot ic ingredients, no excuses are listed \nhere for using these short-cuts 585  and the exoticism of the fruits seems taken for gr anted. 586   \n \nActually, in terms of exotic food, the boundaries a re gradually pushed further with e.g. a \nBrigitte  series titled \u201cForeign women cook in Germany\u201d , featuring e.g. \u201cBrazil dishes up\u201d .587  \nBut it is definitely in the convenience food sector  that the foreign trend is the most patent: \nindeed, besides traditional dishes such as Iglo\u2019s \u201cMy favourite dish \u2013 marinated beef roast\u201d  \n(presented under the caption \u201cAt last an instant meal cooked in the good old way \u201d ), 588   \nfrozen pizzas and baguettes 589  seem to be hits with even Dr Oetker launching a no t too \northodox Pizza Knusperia \u201cBella Bolognese\u201d 590  \u2013not to mention the extension of Iglo\u2019s \npioneering frozen pizza efforts. 591  Maggi also advertises a \u201cFix\u201d  for Bolognaise pasta sauce. 592  \nAnd Iglo\u2019s \u201cSchlemmerfilet [gourmet fillet] \u00e0 la Bordelaise\u201d  seems to be still holding its own \nground under the label \u201crefined French\u201d .593  Libby\u2019s tinned salads represent a truly \ninternational offer, or at least a construction of exoticism, with varieties ranging from \n\u201cNapoli\u201d  to \u201cCalifornia\u201d , \u201cBombay\u201d , \u201cValencia\u201d  and \u201cProvencal\u201d  [sic]. 594  Nevertheless, some \n                                                 \n582  All in Brigitte Sammelrezepte ( Brigitte , Heft 12, 1983): \u201e \u00dcberbackenes Fischfilet mit Staudensellerie\u201d ; \u201eKalte \nButtermilch-Tomatensuppe\u201d  ; \u201e Nudelsalat mit Spinat\u201d .  \n583  \u201eFleichlos gl\u00fccklich: Festmen\u00fc der neuen Art\u201d ; \u201eHaben Sie es bemerkt?

For instance under the headi ng \u201cSalt: poison or medicine?\u201d , an article \nin Brigitte  tackles salt from a number of angles, ranging from  where salt comes from, to its \nrole in the physiology of the body and examines rec ommended daily amounts for adults and \nbabies, salt rich foods, salt surrogates, salt vari eties as well as the role of salt in condiments \nand spice mixes. Responding to the title, the artic le also broaches the potentially adverse \neffects of salt, stating that \u2013even though experts disagree\u2013 salt should not be a problem for \nhealthy individuals since any excess is usually dra ined out of the metabolism. But it cautions \nindividuals suffering from e.g. high-blood pressure  or kidney problems against heavy use. \nHowever, the most interesting element is a referenc e to a new German law regulating the \nlabelling of industrial food:   \n \nFrom the end of this year, almost all foods must be  labelled with an index of all ingredients \nused. The sequence is determined by the quantities of each ingredient but without explicit \nmention of the weight. However, even if the sequenc e of ingredients provides a clue, this \nnovelty does not suffice to effectively control the  amount of table salt used. The order of \ningredients can only provide indications. 596   \n \nThis law provides an interesting catalyser for the potential development of consumers\u2019 \nconsciousness about and control of their food intak e. In this respect, an interesting \nadvertisement for sugar (by the sugar industry) aim s to enlighten the average consumer on \ncomparative energy intake:  \n  \nIf you think that by getting a nice egg from the fr idge and leaving the sugar bowl in the \ncupboard you are saving on calories, you are up a b lind alley. Indeed, 87 calories are hidden \nbehind the fragile eggshell. That is more than two full cups of coffee sweetened with two \nlumps of sugar each, since a lump of sugar only has  12 calories. So it\u2019s not a question of what \nbut of how much one eats. An adult only requires 22 00 to 3200 kcal a day. Just as crucial is a \nvaried and wholesome diet. Besides minerals and vit amins, protein, fats and especially \ncarbohydrates are very important. 597   \n \n                                                 \n595  Ad for K\u00fchne Weinkraut ( Brigitte , Heft 22, 1983) and K\u00fchne Gurkenspezialit\u00e4ten ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 20, 1983). \n596  \u201cSalz: Gift oder Medizin?\u201d ( Brigitte , Heft 21, 1983, pp. 148/150): \u201eNach Ablauf dieses Jahres m\u00fcssen nahezu \nalle Lebensmittel ein Verzeichnis der verwendeten Z utaten auf der Verpackung enthalten, und zwar in de r \nReihenfolge der enthaltenen Mengen, aber ohne Gewic htsangabe.

Neben den Mineralstoffen und Vitaminen geh\u00f6ren  dazu \nEiwei\u00df, Fette und unbedingt auch Kohlenhydrate.\u201c   161 \n \nUnsurprisingly the ad goes on to promote sugar as a n easy-to-digest carbohydrate and to \ndenounce the myth that sugar is the only enemy of t eeth, pointing to the role of bacteria \nwhen dental hygiene is lacking. The text closes wit h a statement whereby sugar is \u201cas \nnatural as milk, butter and bread and thus just as indispensable a food\u201d .598  \n \nFats are also a target for a partly condemning, par tly redeeming rhetoric. For example, becel , \nthe diet fat producer I already mentioned, is inten t on teaching consumers about poly-\nunsaturated fats, under the heading \u201cWhat percentage of polyunsaturated fats is contain ed \nin the new becel Diet-Margarine?\u201d  599  While the rest of the text never goes on to themat ise \nthis percentage, it is the object of a competition enabling lucky guessers to win a (from our \nperspective) rather clunky Unilife pulse monitor. 600  Indeed, the text emphasises that beyond \na balanced ratio between saturated and poly-unsatur ated fat, other health measures are \ncrucial: \u201cSupplement a reasonable diet with enough movement.  If possible in the fresh air. \nBut don\u2019t overstrain yourself. Measure your pulse r ate regularly\u201d.  This provides a good \nexample of a holistic approach to health even if it  remains rather sketchy in the early 1980s.    \n \nIn terms of fat however, the most unexpected ad in 1983 is a CMA 601  ad for butter under the \nseemingly paradoxical heading \u201cButter-light gourmet diet to lose weight\u201d . The illustration \nshows a butterfly (which, in this case, sounds quit e literal in English\u2026) made out of a butter \nshell and sprigs of herbs and four translucent whit e wings against the backdrop of an alpine \nfield. And the text goes on to state: \u201cNow there\u2019s a butter-light and digestible slimming  diet \nfor gourmets with weight problems. In terms of calo ries, butter stands comparison with \nmargarine. Thus whoever wants to cut back on a coup le of little pounds in a tasty way can do \nso with this diet.\u201d  The rest of the text points to the cut-out coupon to order the diet recipes \nemphasising that \u201call recipes have been dietetically tested and are nutritionally balanced\u201d . \nThe reader is then left with the following \u201cparting  shot\u201d: \u201cEnjoying butter is as modern as \never!\u201d 602  This ad convincingly illustrates to what extent th e dieting craze has seeped into \ncontemporary mentalities, since even the most tradi tionally stigmatised food is made the \ntool of a slimming strategy \u2013especially since it is  not explicitly included in an Atkins-style \nfood plan. But the ad is cautious about not going t oo far. The wording is carefully selected: \nthe diet does not promise a drastic weight loss but  is designed for those who just want \u201cto \ncut back on a couple of little pounds\u201d . And it rightfully demystifies the popular belief that \nbutter is more fattening than margarine. Finally, i n the oil arena, an article on olives entitled \n\u201cOlives provide a lot more than oil\u201d  details the different olive types and their origin s as well \n                                                 \n598  Ibid.: \u201eZucker ist so nat\u00fcrlich wie Milch, Butter oder Bro t und genauso ein unentbehrliches Nahrungsmittel.\u201c  \n599  Ad for becel margarine ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 20, 1983): \u201eWieviel Prozent mehrfach unges\u00e4ttigte Fetts\u00e4uren e nth\u00e4lt \ndie neue becel Di\u00e4t-Margarine?\u201c, \u201eErg\u00e4nzen sollten Sie eine vern\u00fcnftige Ern\u00e4hrung durch ausreichende \nBewegung.

In the course of this  process, the rice germ is removed and it is \nprecisely the germ that contains many vitamins as w ell as germ oil, i.e. things that contribute \nto bodily health and that should not be absent from  a balanced wholesome diet. 606  \n \nAnd the illustration shows an enlargement of two wo oden spoons featuring the two types of \nrice, with captions repeating the information conta ined in the text. Otherwise, whole foods \nare still a minority phenomenon. \n \nThe milk product assortment shows at least two comp eting strands: the traditional versus \nthe modern, global and sometimes lighter. The tradi tional trend emphasises local products \nwith an argumentation revolving around the natural goodness of old-fashioned cheeses and \nyogurts, e.g. as in a Landliebe  ad: \n \nLandliebe is full-bodied fresh country milk, from s elected farms, with a natural fat content \nand natural cream. Landliebe means fresh milk produ cts with local fruit and garden herbs \nand without thickening agents or preservatives. Eve rything at Landliebe tastes as natural as \nin the good old days. Landliebe tastes as creamy an d fresh as back then. 607  \n \nThe illustration is a painting of an idyllic German  countryside location and the products are \nphotographed on a bed of grass constellated with da isies. The other main competitor in the \ntraditional offer is French cheese. There a slight culinary inferiority complex seems to \n                                                 \n603  \u201cOliven liefern mehr als \u00d6l\u201d ( Brigitte , Heft 21, 1983).  \n604  Ad for Schneekoppe Natur-Reis ( Brigitte , Heft 24, 1983): \u201e Kann man an der Hautfarbe erkennen, wie \nvitaminreich der Reis ist?\u201c, \u201eDoch wer nun glaubt, da\u00df ein vornehm blasser Reis besonders nahrhaft ist , der irrt. \nDenn wei\u00dfer Reis wird nach dem Sch\u00e4len von seiner z weiten nat\u00fcrlichen Umh\u00fcllung, dem Silberh\u00e4utchen, d urch \nSchleifen getrennt.

Landli ebe \nschmeckt so rahmig-frisch wie damals.\u201d 163 \n \nresurface, 608  as in e.g. an ad for bonbel  with a picture featuring snails, herbs, vegetables , a \nslab of cheese and a glass of Pastis with explanati ons about \u201cescargots \u00e0 la Bourguignonne\u201d  \n[Bourgogne-style snails] or \u201cPastis\u201d  under the small caption \u201cFrench for Gourmets\u201d .609  An \ninteresting crossover product, Bressot , a cream cheese with herbs from the Provence is \npresented as \u201cprepared in Germany in the French style\u201d  \u2013both on the pack, and in the \ncommentary at the bottom of the ad. The accompanyin g \u201cFrench kitsch\u201d illustration displays \na French couple \u2013he middle-aged with a beret, a mou stache, a pipe and a seductive smile, \nshe young, pretty, with an elegant hat and blouse, make-up and earrings\u2013 exchanging views \nabout the cheese. He states \u201cIt\u2019s Bressot\u2019s seasoning that convinces me\u201d . To which she \nretorts: \u201cBut Albert, what would Bressot be without its crea miness\u2026\u201d 610   \n \nThe modern-global strand is characterised by lighte r or functional products. For example, \nRotk\u00e4ppchen , a German Camembert seems to be giving in to a lig hter trend, but without \ngoing all the way to a really \u201clight\u201d cheese like Du darfst . Instead, it is offered in both full fat \n(45%) and three quarter fat (30%) versions in the s ame ad, with captions respectively stating \n\u201cmildly aromatic\u201d  and \u201ceasily digestible\u201d .611  Otherwise French brands such as e.g. Danone  or \nChambourcy , seem to dominate the global market with much more  standardised products \nand a bit less emphasis on local or traditional goo dness. Two points are noteworthy here. \nFirst, in an ad for Danone fruit yogurt with strawb erry pieces it becomes obvious that actual \nfruit pieces are a novelty (compared to artificial flavourings?) since a small nutrition \ninformation table states: \u201cBesides real strawberry pieces, 100g of DanoFrucht  contains ca. \n[\u2026]\u201d .612  Moreover the fat content is down to 2.0 g per 100g  of yogurt, compared to the \naverage 3.5-3.7 g in full fat yogurt. Surprisingly,  this fact is not highlighted as an advantage, \nbut then diet yogurts have not yet appeared on the market. 613  The other highlight of the day \nis Chambourcy \u2019s ad for so-called Bifighurt\u00ae  from its \u201cGreen Container: For a Healthy Life\u201d \nproduct line: \n \nNew. It tastes quite different. Its effects are com pletely different. It also has a totally \ndifferent culture. Hence it really cannot be compar ed to yogurt. Indeed it\u2019s a pure and \nhealthy Bifighurt \u00ae. So, please, what\u2019s a Bifighurt \u00ae? Bifighurt is a creamy and mild sour milk \nproduct with a special new \u201cbifighurt, bifidus\u201d cul ture, exclusively manufactured by \nChambourcy. This bifidus assists your daily digesti on and produces mainly dextrorotary lactic \nacid. Thus it is particularly digestible and provid es new energy. Bifighurt, with its natural fat \n                                                 \n608  Particularly striking evidence for this phenomenon  is provided in an ad for Biskin oil that promises to teach \nconsumers 1000 words to help decipher French or Ita lian menus by attaching new vocabulary to every bot tle of \nvegetable oil. The illustration shows a chef agains t a Riviera-style setting holding a bottle of Biski n and pointing \nto the food on the table, saying: \u201c Voil\u00e0! Les c\u00f4tes de veau et la salade ni\u00e7oise avec Biskin \u00d6l \u2013 hmm\u2026vraiment \nexcellents!\u201d . A German translation is provided underneath in sm all print.

But explanations here are rathe r confusing since the precise effect of \n\u201cdextrorotary lactic acid\u201d  is not spelt out except for its purportedly benefi cial impact on \ndigestion \u2013a fact that will remain constant in the presentation of subsequent enhanced \nyogurts.  \n \nIn terms of drinks, the natural appeal of mineral w ater remains a stable argument and is \noften perceived in a holistic way, as in this bucol ic scene painted by Hirschquelle : \n \nNature is the best host. The nostalgia for the real  and the right leads many back to the \nsources: Once again, you can smell home-baked bread , there is unsprayed fruit in the \norchards, and connoisseurs enjoy extra-dry wine. He nce, it\u2019s no wonder that a great still \nwater from the Black Forest attracts more and more friends: Hirschquelle. It flows for all \nthose who know how to enjoy life as in the good old  days, when man still seemed innocent.  \n615   \n  \nEven if the ad goes on to list health indications, the emphasis here is really on the return to a \nprimeval nature, away from the pollution and denatu ralizing effects of modernity.  \n \n1985-1986: Faster, fresher and more dynamic  \nTowards the mid-1980s, the trend towards lighter fo od is confirmed: except for festive \nmeals, there are less and less heavy cream sauces, meat cuts display less fat and are often \nbraised, meat is served with a lot more vegetables and desserts although still manifold also \ntend towards exotic, lighter versions. Examples of dishes include \u201cstewed beef with paprika\u201d , \n\u201cpork fillet with Swiss chard\u201d , \u201csaut\u00e9ed cucumber with meatballs\u201d  or \u201cblackcurrant sorbet \nwith sparkling wine\u201d .616  Many recipes feature the number of calories/joules  for either the \nmain ingredient or per person & pro dish. Everyday recipes become more adventurous and \ninclude exotic touches such as \u201conion risotto\u201d  or \u201cfish fillet with curried onions\u201d  \u2013whereby \n\u201cCurry is an Indian spice mix that transforms the o nions and the fish into an exotic, refined \nand low-calorie delight\u201d , thus highlighting readers\u2019 potential lack of fami liarity with Indian \n                                                 \n614  Ad for Chambourcy Bifighurt\u00ae ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 18, 1983): \u201e Gr\u00fcner Becher: F\u00fcr gesundes Leben\u201c , \u201e Neu.

So wie damals, als d er Mensch \nnoch kein W\u00e4sserchen tr\u00fcben konnte.\u201c  \n616  All examples drawn from Brigitte Sammelrezepte ( Brigitte , Heft 15, 1986): \u201e Geschnetzeltes Rindfleisch mit \nPaprika\u201c, \u201eSchweinefilet mit Mangold\u201c; \u201eGeschmorte Gurken mit Hackkl\u00f6\u00dfchen\u201c; \u201eJohanisbeer-Sorbet mit S ekt\u201c.   165 \n \nfood. 617  And if stews still hold sway in the autumn and win ter months, it is not only for \ntraditional reasons but because they represent a ga in of time. Indeed, everything is cooked \ntogether, they can be prepared quickly and in advan ce as well as cooked in large quantities \nand then frozen. 618  Often, cooking articles will focus on a seasonal o r unusual ingredient, \ndemonstrating different ways of preparing it \u2013be it  peppers (healthy and low-calorie), 619  \ncurd cheese (versatile, inexpensive and low-calorie ), 620  or cucumber (cheap and low \ncalorie). 621   \n \nA striking development is an increasing number of v egetarian menus and dishes, as e.g. in a \nBrigitte  cooking supplement featuring 7 menus for gourmets with the following rationale: \n\u201cVegetarian cooking is becoming more and more popul ar. It is varied, tastes new and is also \nhealthy. Hence there are many reasons to try these still unfamiliar but enticing recipes\u201d .622  \nUnder the motto \u201cRefined food \u2013 without meat\u201d , prima  even presents a monthly vegetarian \ncooking feature with recipes such as \u201ctomatoes with spinach and mozzarella\u201d , \u201ccourgette \nwith Balkan vegetables\u201d ,623  cold soups, 624  or \u201cwholemeal pasta with mushroom sauce\u201d , \n\u201cchervil cream soup\u201d 625  and even a \u201crevolutionary\u201d Christmas menu without meat: \u201cYou can \nreally feast at Christmas, even without meat. Here is our suggestion for a refined menu\u201d .626  \n \nInternational food also makes a breakthrough, mainl y based on \u201choliday memories\u201d, i.e. on \nparticularly popular/affordable holiday destination s such as Italy, 627  Spain 628  and Greece, 629  \nwith the occasionally more exotic invitation (such as China). Surprisingly, recipes are not just \nconfined to clich\u00e9 dishes such as \u201cdolmades\u201d [Greek stuffed vine leaves] or \u201ctortilla de \npatatas\u201d  [traditional Spanish potato omelette] but also inc lude less generic recipes such as \n\u201cmejillones Gallegos\u201d  [Galician mussels] or \u201clachanosalata\u201d [Greek cabbage salad]. \nMoreover, \u201cRice like never before\u201d , an article in prima  about rice, containing a lot of general \nand nutritional information on the cereal, makes on e suspect that although it may be a \nstaple in the German diet, it has not been exploite d very imaginatively until then: \u201cThe only \ncompetition for rice (besides pasta) is potatoes. B ut rice is almost more versatile. It is also \neasy to store when raw, can be kept and reused when  cooked\u201d.  Recipes include \u201cfried \n                                                 \n617  Both recipes from \u201eZwiebeln: sch\u00f6ner essen im Sept ember\u201c ( Frau im Spiegel , Heft 38, 11.09.1986, p. 59 ss.): \n\u201eFischfilet mit Zwiebel-Curry Gem\u00fcse\u201c;  \u201eCurry ist eine indische Gew\u00fcrzmischung und macht di e Zweibeln mit \ndem Fisch zu einer exotisch raffinierten, kaloriena rmen Leckerei\u201c.  \n618  \u201eEint\u00f6pfe: Da ist alles drin\u201c ( prima , Heft 11, 1986, p. 212 ss.).  \n619  \u201ePaprika\u201c ( prima , Heft 8, 1986, p. 158 ss.): \u201e gesund und kalorienarm\u201c.  \n620  \u201eQuark\u201c ( prima , Heft 4, 1986, p. 146 ss.): \u201e vielseitig, preiswert und kalorienarm\u201c.  \n621  \u201eGurken\u201c ( prima , Heft 7, 1986, p. 160 ss.): \u201e preiswert und kalorienarm\u201c.  \n622  \u201eVegetarisch genie\u00dfen\u201c ( Brigitte , Heft 16, 1986, p. 106 ss.): \u201e Die vegetarische K\u00fcche findet immer mehr \nFreunde.

Sch\u00fcle Gold , for example, advertises its wheat germ improved n oodles \nwith either a couple performing an acrobatic dance or trekking, alongside the caption \u201cBeing \nfit is fun and tastes good\u201d .631  Barilla  is even so brash as to use an all-Italian caption over its \nads \u201cLa pasta Barilla. Un tema con variazioni.\u201d  [Barilla pasta. A theme with variations], \nbefore presenting various typologies of pasta along  with their breadth or length. The texts \nbelow the photographs aim to educate the German con sumer about the origin of \ningredients, the types of sauces that should be use d to accompany the different types of \npasta, and provide translations for concepts or ing redients such as \u201cpasta asciutta\u201d , \u201cpasta \nin brodo\u201d , \u201cpasta al forno\u201d , \u201cformaggio\u201d , \u201csalsa\u201d  or \u201csugo\u201d . But the most significant \nparagraph is no doubt the following: \u201cIt will probably come as a surprise to you that ou r \ntagliatelle, tortellini, papardelle, lasagne, etc. are about to become as popular here in \nGermany as they are back home in Italy. Obviously, we are delighted.\u201d 632    \n  \nMeat, however, has not disappeared from the German diet, far from it, e.g. an ad for Rewe  \nsupermarkets displays a typology of Leberwurst [liv er sausage], 633  moustachioed male \nmodels in traditional dress present huge platters o f Hungarian salami, sausages and \nbacon, 634  and CMA  presents a close-up of pork chops swimming in hot fat with the caption \n\u201cMeat is a must. Take a bite. [\u2026] Meat is a piece o f vital energy\u201d .635  Talking of hot fat, Rewe  \npresents a typology of fats that can be used to dee p fry without burning or smoking. The ad \nstretching over a double page features a hot griddl e type surface with close-ups of large \nblobs of fat gradually melting on the surface, a vi sion that may appear almost as distasteful \nas cheap pornography to our contemporary eyes. 636  In contrast, under the heading \u201cOn the \ngastronomic road with Biskin\u201d , the brand displays recipes developed by chefs in traditional \nGerman restaurants. Here, however, even if fat is v isible on some of the illustrations, the \nmeat cuts themselves have become much leaner. 637  \n \nThis ambivalence between traditional and \u201clight\u201d al so transpires in ads for butter. Two CMA  \nads for butter extol traditional food styling and c onsumption rationales \u2013 in stark contrast \nwith CMA \u2019s rather pathetic attempt to promote a butter diet  in 1983, which I analysed \nabove. Indeed, the clock seems to have turned back and the two ads foregrounding butter \nwith meat and butter with fish try to revive the wa ning popularity of the animal fat & protein \n                                                 \n630  \u201eNeue internationale Rezepte: Reis wie sonst nie\u201c ( prima , Heft 10, 1986): \u201e Reis wie sonst nie\u201c;\u201c Einzige \nKonkurrenz (neben Nudel) ist f\u00fcr Reis die Kartoffel .

In the first ad, a big slab of meat is  pictured with a couple of onion rings, \nmushrooms, herbs and 3 butter shells in the foregro und and the text trumpets the following: \n\u201cButter\u2019s nature cannot be separated from meat\u2019s he althy vital energy [\u2026] We need not \nrenounce butter-refined pleasure. Indeed it has app roximately the same calorie content as \nmargarine. Naturally butter!\u201d 638  However, butter\u2019s true nature remains just as myste rious as \nmeat\u2019s taken for granted \u201chealthy life energy\u201d . Before closing with the same slogan, the fish \nad uses a similar tack: \u201cButter\u2019s nature cannot be separated from the healt hy protein in fish. \nThe healthy resources in natural foods are the basi s of human existence. This is why human \nbeings have always instinctively eaten what is good  for them.\u201d  639  Additionally, both ads \nemphasise that butter is very easy to digest. Here again, the rhetoric remains very general, \nrelying on simplified clich\u00e9s such as fish\u2019s reputa tion for lightness (without providing any \nremotely scientific backing) or a flimsy appeal to human beings\u2019 \u201csurefire\u201d food instinct. A \npositive essentialist conception of nature is the t enor that remains with us. A mitigating \nfactor here could be the fact that these ads stem f rom stern , a weekly news magazine, \ninstead of a women\u2019s magazine. Thus, it is quite co nceivable that the rhetoric chosen for \nthese ads remains more general \u2013and less diet-orien ted\u2013 in a magazine targeting both sexes. \nIndeed, the meat ad seems particularly fit to appea l to a masculine audience as conceived of \nthen. Nevertheless, it should be noted that both ad s sport a cut out tag to order the \u201cThis \nyear will be butter-light\u201d  [Dieses Jahr wird butterleicht] recipe calendar. 640     \n \nIn 1986, the ads for butter and margarine take on a n unmistakable health orientation, 641  The \nCMA  butter ad shows a woman in tracksuit and trainers asymmetrically bent over, touching \nher right foot with her left hand and stretching th e other arm towards the sky or the ceiling \n(the background is unspecified). The discourse has left the slimming diet rhetoric behind to \nconcentrate on \u201cpure\u201d health aspects: \n \nButter\u2019s nature involves a healthy diet. Whoever ha s maintained a healthy relationship with \nfood can rejoice in butter. It is naturally so perf ect that no nutrients need be added to it. It \nmatures biologically and not technologically. Becau se it has always been produced naturally. \nThis is why butter is so popular with nature-consci ous people. It boasts a very large \npercentage of short-chained fatty acids that make i t butter-light and butter-good to digest. \nWith a melting point of under 35\u00ba C, it is below bo dy temperature and thus very easily \nabsorbed. Butter requires so little work from the d igestive organs that it is also very \nappropriate in a liver- or gallbladder-friendly die t. Moreover, it also provides precious \nminerals, trace elements and important vitamins. Bu tter is a great contribution to our \n                                                 \n638  Ad for CMA butter ( stern , Heft 24, 1985): \u201e Zur Natur der Butter geh\u00f6rt die gesunde Lebenskraft  vom Fleisch. \n[\u2026] Auf butterfeinen Genu\u00df brauchen wir nicht zu ve rzichten. Schlie\u00dflich hat sie in etwa die gleichen Kalorien \nwie pflanzliches Streichfett. Nat\u00fcrlich Butter!\u201c   \n639  Ad for CMA butter ( stern , Heft 23, 1985): \u201e Zur Natur der Butter geh\u00f6rt das gesunde Eiweiss vom  Fisch. Die \ngesunden Wertstoffe nat\u00fcrlicher Lebensmittel bilden  die Grundlage der menschlichen Existenz. Darum ess en die \nMenschen schon immer instinktiv das, was ihnen gut tut.\u201c  \n640  But it should be noted that from the mid-1980s, sl imming rhetoric is no longer the sole apanage of wo men, \nas illustrated by an ad for Mikro-Di\u00e4t diet drink ( freundin , Heft 12, 1985) under the caption \u201eWer abnehmen \nwill, muss leiden. Oder den Coupon ausschneiden\u201c . However, the illustration \u2013no doubt unwittingly\u2013 lends a \nslightly ironic tinge to the appropriation of slend erness for men. A man whose attire consists in Hawa iian style \nboxer shorts and a pair of pilot-style glasses is p ictured in a rather cramped position on the scales,  his fists \nclenched in a victoriously sporty attitude, and a b road grin spread across his face.   \n641  But, in all fairness, I should emphasise that the ads I have for that year are all drawn from women\u2019s  \nmagazines\u2026. 168 \n \nhealthy fitness [sic] and only contains about the s ame amount of calories as margarine. So \nenjoy its butter-delicious taste with a good consci ence. Naturally butter! 642  \n \nThe rhetorical evolution is subtle but obvious here . Even though the appeal to an essentialist \nnature remains, there are more attempts at anchorin g this worldview into a \u201cscientific\u201d \ndiscourse: expressions such as \u201cshort-chained fatty  acids\u201d, \u201cmelting point\u201d, \u201cliver\u201d, \n\u201cgallbladder\u201d or \u201ctrace elements\u201d at least pay trib ute to this will even if the explanations \nremain sketchy and rather unconvincing from a nutri tional or physiological point of view. \nParadoxically, while a scientific view is implicitl y courted, technology is obviously rejected \nsince it appears to stand in the way of nature. Thi s polarity obscures the fact that butter has \nlong been a technological product that does not jus t happen in a modern refrigerated \nenvironment. However, this rejection of technology can also be read as a stab at margarine \u2013\noften viewed as a techno-artificial product\u2013 thus c ontributing to a long-established war or at \nleast rivalry between the two products. 643  Two health scripts are opposed here: an \napparently unadulterated process vs. a technically supported one, two versions that today\u2019s \nhealth discourse often reconciles into a \u201ctechnonat ural\u201d (or perhaps \u201csupernatural\u201d) \nnarrative \u2013 as we will note further.    \n \nIn contrast, margarine seems less intent on defendi ng itself against butter but just as intent \non being associated with fitness and active leisure , as displayed in two ads for Flora soft  \npromoting two competitions to win fitness holidays (including swimming, surfing, tennis, \nvolleyball, archery, golf and waterskiing). The cap tion reads: \u201cBeing and staying fit! With \nFlora soft!\u201d . In both ads, the female model is dressed in white  fitness gear. Paradoxically, in \nthe first ad, the model is riding an exercise bike [Heimtrainer] on a grassy surface against a \nnatural background while making a victory sign with  one hand. Unsurprisingly though, the \nrunner-up prizes are 111 Tunturi  exercise bikes. The hotel picture here concentrate s on a \ncoastal view with a windsurfer. 644  The later ad displays the model riding a regular b ike on a \nlawn with legs outstretched and an enthusiastic smi le. In this case, the runner-up prizes here \ninclude 33 light athletic bikes [Leichtlaufr\u00e4der] w ith six gears or 333 soft jogging towels with \nthe \u201cFlora soft\u201d stripes. The ad includes the menti on that Flora soft  is an official supplier for \nthe West German Olympic team. A small picture of th e Spanish hotel is included with a \nspecial focus on the pool. 645   \n \nIn terms of milk products, the subdivision between healthy, traditional and foreign remains, \nwith the health discourse gaining in weight. A seri es of ads for jocca  cottage cheese has \nrelinquished health rhetoric brainwashing in favour  of more targeted, lighter publicity with a \n                                                 \n642  Ad for CMA butter ( Brigitte , Heft 1, 1986), \u201e Gesunde Ern\u00e4hrung liegt in der Natur der Butter.

Denn sie entsteht, wie schon immer, auf nat\u00fcrliche Weise. Darum steht Butter gerade bei  den \nNaturbewu\u00dften so hoch im Kurs. Mit einem sehr gro\u00dfe n Anteil kurzkettiger Fetts\u00e4uren, die f\u00fcr butterlei chte \nVerdaulichkeit und buttergute Bek\u00f6mmlichkeit sorgen . Mit weniger als 35\u00ba liegt ihr Schmelzpunkt unter der \nK\u00f6rpertemperatur, darum wird sie besonders schnell resorbiert.

Nat\u00fcrlich  Butter!\u201c  \n643  Cf. Pelzer, Birgit & Reith, Reinhold, Margarine , Berlin: Wagenbach, 2001. \n644  Ad for Flora soft ( Bunte , Heft 15, 1985): \u201e Fit sein und bleiben.Mit Flora soft\u201c.  \n645  Ad for Flora soft ( Brigitte , Heft 4, 1986). 169 \n \nseries of at least three ads showing a middle-aged woman ( \u201cA conscious diet is a must for \nme\u201d ), 646  a middle-aged man ( \u201cA conscious diet keeps me fit\u201d )647  and a young senior woman \n(\u201c Healthy eating makes me a lot more active\u201d ). 648  In all of them the sober caption reads as \nfollows: \u201cJocca, the healthy & fresh snack\u201d 649  and the small text extols healthy fresh milk, \nnatural vitamins and minerals, a high protein/low f at content as well as a light and satiating \neffect. In contrast, m\u00fcller  sells its pure buttermilk with a more strongly gen dered discourse: \nin the ad picturing a young woman, the caption read s \u201cMakes you young and beautiful\u201d 650  \nwhereas the ad showing a young man reads: \u201cMakes you as fit as a fiddle\u201d .651  However, both \nads state: \u201cEnjoy m\u00fcller\u2019s pure buttermilk daily. THE treatmen t for your body. With a lot of \nprotein + lecithin + natural calcium + vitamins.\u201d 652  Here buttermilk is explicitly marketed as \nmedicine or therapy, thus hinting at food\u2019s holisti c impact. 653  A year later, i.e. in 1986, m\u00fcller \nadvertises its multivitamin buttermilk (with 10 fru its and enhanced with 10 vitamins) as \n\u201cCosmetics from the inside\u201d  displaying the made-up profile of a female model w ith perfectly \nmanicured and painted finger nails sipping buttermi lk from the pot with a straw. The text is a \nparticularly arresting example of the gradual overl ap or blending of discourses pertaining to \npreviously separate realms \u2013in this case food and c osmetics:   \n \nHere is reliable information about multivitamin but termilk: the numerous vitamins cover the \ndaily requirement of an adult and give her/him a se ductive complexion. Calcium also has a \nbeautifying effect (beauty for hair and teeth!), as  well as protein (beauty for the muscles!), \nnot to mention the small amount of only 0.13 fat (b eauty for the figure!). What make-up can \ncompare with this? (Pure buttermilk! An equally eff ective broadband cosmetic). 654   \n \nEven milk tries to refresh its image by picturing y oung and dynamic people empowered by \nits content. A 1985 CMA  ad shows a pretty teenager sitting on a motorcycle  with a T-shirt \nemblazoned with the famous \u201cDie Milch macht\u2019s\u201d  [Milk is it!] slogan. 655  Her winsome smile is \nemphasised by the milk \u201cmoustache\u201d left over from s ipping at the big glass in her hand. An \nadditional slogan simply states \u201cYoung. Fresh. Really powerful.\u201d 656  Under the heading \n\u201cTreatment time\u201d , a contemporary ad by Milch aus Bayern  displays a sauna environment \nwith three senior men of different ages \u2013all sporti ng Rubensian curves and all in a jolly good \n                                                 \n646  Ad for Kraft jocca e.g. ( prima , Heft 3, 1986): \u201e Bewu\u00dfte Ern\u00e4hrung geh\u00f6rt f\u00fcr mich dazu\u201c.   \n647  Ad for Kraft jocca e.g. ( Bunte , Heft 15, 1985): \u201e Bewu\u00dfte Ernahrung h\u00e4lt mich in Form\u201c.  \n648  Ad for Kraft jocca e.g. ( Bunte , Heft 14, 1985): \u201eGesundes Essen macht mich viel aktiver\u201c .

If fast cook ing is to be fun, \nyou need the appropriate products. Pfanni fresh pac ks \u2013 straight from the pack into the pan. \nA quick tip: Pfanni \u2013 Fried potatoes with skewered meat/vegetables\u201d . Elaborate justifications \nno longer seem to be required. Fun, as a concept, s uffices: a  perspective confirmed by the \nillustration showing a modern thirty-something woma n lying playfully on a couch, barefoot \nand dressed in leisurewear, a big basket with knitt ing yarn at her elbow and one hand \nstretched out holding a roast potato pack. 659  Another ad for Pfanni  sums it up even more \npointedly: \u201cReal fried potatoes that spell only fun and no wor k\u201d .660  The \u201ccooking for singles\u201d \ntheme also surfaces, as in a humorous ad for Sonnen Bassermann \u2019s Schwetzinger asparagus \ncream soup. The illustration shows a can of soup, a  key holder with a Spanish key-ring \nprominently displayed, a lighter, a biro and a fold ed newspaper displaying the personals \npage against a checkerboard background. The caption  reads \u201cFriendly single m., good cook, \nseeks nice w. to play draughts.\u201d661  However, singlehood here is not presented as a \npotentially enduring or positive state but just as a phase before companionship. Otherwise, \nthe convenience food assortment displays more exoti cism: starting with Italian specialities, it \nnow includes not only Parisian onion soup or paella  but also nasi goreng, bami goreng, chop \nsuey, sweet&sour Chinese food 662  or zaziki. 663   \n \nFurthermore, the convenience food assortment has gr own to include genuine \u201cfast food\u201d, \ne.g. takeaway salads in the shape of McDonald\u2019s  Chef or Mexicana salads 664  or iglo \u2019s frozen \nsalad herbs full of \u201chealthy vitamins\u201d. 665  Actually, iglo  has expanded its convenience offer to \ninclude a total of 15 \u201cBistro\u201d menus \u2013heralding the  glamour of restaurant food at home \n(\u201cThis is how you can open your own bistro at home\u201d )\u2013 of which four are \u201clight\u201d menus. 666  \nPointedly, the ad comes with a competition enticing  readers to win either 200 Bistro samples \nor 55 microwaves. It is actually the first ad I hav e unearthed that displays a logo with a wave \nand the caption \u201cAlso microwavable\u201d . A contemporary article in Frau im Spiegel  even \nprovides a basic initiation to the microwave: \u201cCooking with a microwave means saving: time, \n                                                 \n657  Ad for Milch aus Bayern ( Bunte , Heft 20, 1985): \u201e Kurzeit\u201c; \u201eMilchzeit ist jederzeit\u201c.  \n658  Ad for CMA milk ( prima , Heft 10, 1986): \u201e Hab\u2019 Spa\u00df am Erfolg!\u201c  \n659  Ad for Pfanni ( prima , Heft 7, 1986): \u201e Schnelle K\u00fcche\u201c; \u201eGeht schnell, schmeckt prima und sieht gut aus. \nDamit die schnelle K\u00fcche Spa\u00df macht, braucht man au ch die richtigen Produkte.

And that is also the grea t advantage of this fast helper that is \ngradually beginning to conquer our kitchens\u201d  The article goes on to explain what microwaves \nare best suited for, that they cannot replace conve ntional cooking methods but only \ncomplement them, how they can be combined with othe r types of ovens and what \ncontainers should be used. It also provides a basic  technical explanation and tries to dispel \nsecurity concerns. 667  Illustrations include various microwaves and combi ned oven models \nwith women using them, dishes that can be used both  to cook and serve as well as Dr \nOetker \u2019s \u201cMikrowellen-Kochbuch\u201d [microwave cookbook].  \n \nA particularly striking contemporary ad is provided  by Siemens . The first page shows a \ncharming thirty-something young woman dressed in a suit with a butterfly collar and a tie \nbut with long hair and well made-up. She sports a w inning, ironic smile whilst holding her \nfinger up in a slightly menacing way. Below the Sie mens logo, the caption states: \u201cYou\u2019re \ngoing to eat whatever I serve you!\u201d  and a small blurb near her raised finger reads: \u201cThe new \ncuisine. Cooking with love and fantasy \u2013a new type of versatile and varied cooking is \nemerging in an ever increasing number of households \u201d . The next page displays a combination \noven, the so-called Microwelle Plus  with the following statement: \u201cCrusty onion quiche, juicy \nchicken legs, pasta au gratin, delicious marzipan c ake, everything in half the time; cooking \nwhat you like while remaining fit.\u201d668  This ad is particularly subtle. On the one hand, t he \ngestalt of the woman is typical of the eighties: sh e sports a perfect hairdo and make-up (and \nis associated with loving and creative cooking!) bu t the masculine connotation of the suit \nspells professional control over everyday life and hints at the fact that women increasingly \ncombine an outer professional life with housework a nd are thus entitled to cooking helps (if \nonly technical). They are also legitimised to impos e particular food choices and cooking \nmethods on the family \u2013choices and methods that no longer require cowering excuses.  \n \nThis ad builds on and to some extent transcends pre vious ads for pressure cookers and \nkitchen robots. In the previous year, modern pressu re cookers appear to be making a \nbreakthrough using the rationales of both speed and  healthy cooking. An ad for Silit \u2019s \nSicomatic  shows a surprisingly plump woman in her kitchen \u2013d ressed casually but sporting a \nchef\u2019s hat. She has just filled the cooker with veg etables and is about to place the lid on it. \nFrau Heidi Br\u00fcck is thus shown imitating a certain Albert Bouley, one of the best \ncontemporary cooks in Germany, 669  by using the so-called \u201cBiogaren\u201d [bio-cooking] me thod: \n\u201cCooking what tastes good while remaining fit\u201d .670  Noteworthy here is the fact that \u2013\ncompared to the Siemens ad\u2013 the woman is the boss i n her own home but still requires a \nfamous male role-model to support her choices. 671  \n                                                 \n667  Interestingly, it states that all microwaves must be registered at the post-office but that this step  is free of \ncharge.

Although there is no real intimation 172 \n \n \nIn terms of drinks, fruit juices \u2013especially functi onal- seem to enjoy a lasting popularity. \nApart from the by then well-established Trink 10  multivitamin drink ( \u201cVitamins energise the \nbody and mobilise the mind\u201d ), 672  the Dr Koch  range in 1986 has been supplemented with a \nnew Plus E  drink, a fruit or vegetable blend enriched with vi tamin E ( \u201cThe beautiful way of \ndoing more for oneself\u201d ). The illustration shows a young and pretty model with an intense \nand surprisingly serious stare 673  alongside the caption \u201cShe feels fine. And it\u2019s obvious\u201d . No \nprecise explanations are given about the effect of vitamin E except that it makes one feel \n\u201ccompletely well\u201d .  \n \nMineral water, however, seems to be by far the most  popular drink. The traditional health \ndiscourse is still present (e.g. St Gero  or Evian ), but increasingly, it is embedded in the \nlifestyle of potentially stressed 1980s professiona ls. An ad vaunting the merits of \nHirschquelle  mineral water provides a convincing illustration o f this phenomenon. It depicts \n\u201cthe astounding healing water from the Black Forest \u201d on a double page. The first picture \nunder the title \u201c Hirschquelle everyday \u201d depicts a bottle of Hirschquelle placed in a waterfall \nsetting (with damp rocks as a backdrop and a river flowing at the bottom); water rises like a \ngeyser at the mouth of the bottle. The second pictu re shows a man standing in his office, \nstretching his arms out whilst holding a glass of m ineral water; a typewriter, documents, and \nthe bottle are lying on the table. The atmosphere i s bathed in a golden light that suggests \nthe end of a fruitful afternoon\u2019s work. The heading  reads \u201c A prescription that Nature has \nwritten for you \u201d. The text under the two pictures first describes the mineral water\u2019s long \nhistory and healing pedigree, providing information  on its physiological effects, before \nsuggesting a prescription: \n \nRelax between two thoughts with a refreshing glass of Hirschquelle; this is a very simple way \nof contributing to your well-being. And because Hir schquelle also tastes good, this extremely \nhealthy still water is a great thirst quencher for the whole family. Moreover, Hirschquelle \nhelps to stimulate the appetite. \u2013We live in an age  that is rediscovering the unadulterated \npleasures of nature. Hirschquelle belongs to it. 674  \n \nThe mineral water can thus be integrated into every day work routines, providing a welcome \nbreak as well as fostering inspiration and even app etite. The striking contrast between a \nnatural and a corporate environment is bridged by t he fact that productivity can be \nstimulated through targeted natural recuperation [E rholung]. Moreover, the effects of the \nwater are not purely physiological or even mental, they also connect the individual to a \nlarger sphere, that of the natural ecosystem. And t he fact that the family is also mentioned \nmeans that this product can easily transit from the  realm of work to the realm of private life, \n                                                                                                                                                         \nof job-sharing, there is at least leisure-sharing\u2026 Cf.

Fachinger  takes a similar tack in an ad designed as a small 1-page feature article. \nUnder the heading \u201cShe feels happy as a clam\u201d  [in German: as happy as a poodle],  675  it \nshows pictures of a woman smiling and relaxing on h er sofa at home holding a\u2026 poodle, \nalongside the following introduction: \u201cA woman\u2019s achievement calls for respect: she is ac tive \nfrom dawn to dusk for both job and family. It is su rprising that she still feels well despite this \nhectic lifestyle\u201d . She continues to smile while sticking a pencil in  her hair and answering the \nphone at work (\u201c A woman achieves a lot \u2013 both on the job and in her  household. Therefore, \nshe must be healthy\u201d ), she smiles on while playing tennis  (\u201c Healthy eating makes her fit for \nsport, housework and her job\u201d ) but her smile has become a bit of a distant mecha nical smirk \nas she fills her shopping cart in the last photogra ph (\u201c Usually, there\u2019s little time left for \nshopping. One has to think of everything \u2013 Fachinge r for health, nibbles for the children, and \nhubby\u2019s favourite food\u201d ). The text goes on to extol how much a woman has t o achieve in all \nthese realms and emphasises that her well-being is not a matter of luck but the product of \nhealth, sport, the right food and\u2026 mineral water wit h various minerals and trace elements, \nlike Staatl. Fachingen  (\u201cIt comes from the depth of the earth \u2013pure as natu re\u2013 it is only lightly \nsparkling and free from all environmental pollutant s\u201d ). And its effects are truly amazing: \n\u201cWell-being, enthusiasm and elasticity are maintain ed. It fuels performance and stamina and \nthe entire organism retains its energy\u201d .676  The emphasis here is on performance and \nendurance to counter the stresses of everyday life.  From this perspective, women\u2019s \nemancipation is more of an overwork/multitasking gu arantee than a demand for a more \nbalanced task-sharing, let alone striving towards a  more fulfilling, balanced life. In contrast, a \nHeppinger ad, under the heading \u201cHealthy living tastes good\u201d , remain faithful to the clich\u00e9 of \nthe fit woman: this time, it portrays a dancer/gymn ast performing an impressive caper as \nopposed to the previous model practising yoga postu res. The aesthetic appeal seems to be \ndominant here, since posters of the ads can be orde red against 5 DM. 677  \n \nHealth foods seem to hold an increasingly strong po sition with the multiplication of ads for \nneuform  health-food shops, showing Polaroid snapshots of c ustomers in front of the shops \nin various locations. The examples I have collected  include a man 678  and a woman with her \nlittle daughter. 679  Both ads emphasise the breadth of the offer \u2013inclu ding whole foods, \nnatural remedies, quality plant-based cosmetics and  diet foods\u2013 and the competence of the \nstaff. A later ad promotes a free issue of the \u201c neuform Kurier \u201d \u2013a health food magazine\u2013 on \nchildren\u2019s adequate nutrition for the beginning of the school year. 680   \n  \n                                                 \n675  the literal German expression is \u201cwell like a pood le\u201d: \u201eSie f\u00fchlt sich pudelwohl\u201d \n676  Ad for Staatl.

Dr Kousa , for \ninstance offers three varieties in 1985: Bircher-M\u00fc sli [classic muesli], Fr\u00fcchte-M\u00fcsli [fruit \nmuesli] and Schoko-M\u00fcsli [chocolate muesli]. Sellin g arguments include energy, high quality \nprotein, easily digestible carbohydrates, minerals,  B-complex vitamins as well as vitamins D \nand E plus fibre to naturally regulate digestion. 681  Schneekoppe  is more ambitious in its \nteaching programme: it dismisses the modern breakfa st involving a slice of toast and a sip of \ncoffee, because breakfast should be the most import ant meal of the day since it determines \nthe quality of performance and concentration. Along  with the other nutrients enumerated in \nthe Dr Kousa  ad, complex carbohydrates are seen as the key to e nduring performance \u2013as \nshown in a small graph displaying comparative curve s for the two types of breakfast. \nPredictably, the conventional breakfast curve peaks  very rapidly around 9 am before \nvertiginously dropping shortly before eleven. In co ntrast, the muesli breakfast curve is much \nless impressive but keeps its adepts satiated until  midday. The caption reads \u201c\u2018Empty\u2019 \ncalories mean that energy is expended too quickly. Tiredness comes earlier and hunger \nquicker\u201d .682  But the most striking ad is for muesli bars by Dr Oetker  under the heading \n\u201cmodern food\u201d . The text states: \u201cFor us, \u2018modern food\u2019 spells products that particu larly \nsatisfy the demand for a conscious diet. Balanced p roducts for breakfast or as a snack in-\nbetween.\u201d 683  This is the first ad for a convenience health food  I have been able to detect. \nNevertheless, it should be stressed that it is not yet functional since no micro-nutrients have \nbeen added.    \n \nOtherwise, crisp bread represent an absolute hit. I f heavy-duty health food discourse can still \noccasionally be found (as in an ad for Nestl\u00e9 \u2019s Alevita  with its special low-salt crisp bread 684 ), \nmost other ads go for a much lighter note, emphasis ing the tremendous energy boost \nsupposedly delivered by consuming crisp bread for b reakfast. Leicht&Cross , for example, \nshows a woman at the breakfast table catching a pac k of the crisp bread. 685  But it is a tame \nfeat compared to the exploits performed by individu als consuming Wasa  crackers. To the \namazement of onlookers, Frau Dr. Siepe from Bielefe ld literally flies out of the supermarket \nwith her shopping cart like superman 686  and the supervisory board of Hermann Hase AG all \nperform handstands after a meal of crisp bread, 687  not to mention little karateka Mucki \nAnders who swings a fat sumotori above his head whi le another sumotori looks on aghast. 688  \nA year later, Elfie Strac\u2019s consumption of Wasa cra ckers enables her to master a very \nparticular kind of waterskiing, since the skis have  been replaced by two male swimmers. 689  \nAll these exploits are fuelled by the complex carbo hydrates, the high quality protein, \nminerals and vitamins contained in the bread.  \n \n                                                 \n681  Ad for Dr. Kousa Vollkorn-M\u00fcslis ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 24, 1985).  \n682  Ad for Schneekoppe Fr\u00fcchte-M\u00fcesli [according to th e illustration, the assortment also includes Waldho nig, \nVitamine Drink and Tomaten Trunk] ( Bunte , Heft 15, 1985): \u201e \u201aLeere\u2018 Kalorien geben ihre Energie zu schnell ab. \nMan erm\u00fcdet fr\u00fcher und bekommt rasch wieder Hunger. \u201c  \n683  The soft varieties include chocolate, hazelnut or apple pieces and the crunchy varieties are represen ted by \nhoney, raisins or coconut.

Above it, a photograph displays male hands openin g a can \u2013 the hands \nappear moist with sweat and one of the wrists consp icuously sports a tennis band that \nclearly spells \u201cexertion\u201d. And the text goes on to describe in detail how the body loses \nprecious minerals when sweating and how this phenom enon ultimately leads to diminished \nperformance: \u201cEven a loss of fluid equivalent to 2% of body weig ht can lead to a \nperformance drop of 20%\u201d . Just below, a little diagram illustrates the evol ution of \nperformance with and without the intake of isostar . After a description of the physiological \neffects of the drink, one can read \u201cThis is how you can counter decreasing performance  and \nhold out longer\u201d .690  In this case, the technoscientific discourse is pa rticularly prominent in \norder to lend credibility to the new product.  \n \nOtherwise, women\u2019s magazines continue to often feat ure articles on particular foods, drinks \nor seasonings (e.g. honey, milk, salt, water, etc.)  with an analysis of their healthfulness, \nrecommendations about how they should be used and a reas or conditions where caution \nshould be exercised. prima  is the most consistent with a monthly nutrition fe ature that often \nenlists the knowledge of specialists to reassure an d admonish consumers. From my \nperspective, the most interesting features are thos e which enable one to grasp the zeitgeist. \nThe article on water, for instance, states that wom en and men drink respectively 1.14 and \n1.86 litres per day, which is considered entirely s ufficient and even excessive for men. In \ncontrast, the lower liquid consumption of older peo ple is condemned. But when the \nquestion arises as to the roles of various drinks i n fluid consumption (bearing in mind that, in \n1986, Germans drink way more coffee and beer than m ilk, sodas, mineral water, tea and \nwine) the answer runs thus: \n \nStrictly speaking, coffee, beer, tea and wine shoul d be considered as stimulants. Milk is a \nnatural, fantastic blend of food and drink. So-call ed refreshing drinks [soft drinks]  do not \nalways live up to their name. (Mineral) water is th e only physiologically correct drink that we \nneed. 691    \n \nStrangely enough, the diuretic property of the \u201csti mulants\u201d are not even mentioned \u2013a \nproperty that should warrant a higher intake of oth er fluids to compensate for the water \neliminated. Moreover, green tea or herbal teas are not yet singled out as good rehydrating \ndrinks. Similarly, an article on milk implicitly ad mits that milk may be difficult to digest: \nindeed, it suggests blending it with fruit juices ( strangely enough also citrus!). However, it \ndoes not mention its allergy potential at all which  may either suggest that this potential has \nnot yet been recognised amongst other allergens or that the German population is not yet as \nsensitive to lactose as the explosion of lactose-fr ee drinks suggests in the late 1990s. \nAnother interesting point at the end of the milk ar ticle is a question about the impact of the \nChernobyl disaster on the quality of milk. The spec ialist interviewed \u2013the director of the \nInstitute for Chemistry and Physics of the Federal Agency for Milk Research in Kiel\u2013 begins by \nemphasising that a substantial (0.5l) daily intake of milk is a nutritional must that cannot be \n                                                 \n690  Ad for Wander isostar ( stern , Heft 22, 1985): \u201e Isotonischer Durstl\u00f6scher zum Durchhalten\u201c; \u201eSchon ein \nFl\u00fcssigkeitsverlust von nur 2% des K\u00f6rpergewichts k ann zu einer Leistungsminderung von 20% f\u00fchren.\u201c; \u201e So \nbegegnen Sie dem Leistungsabfall und k\u00f6nnen l\u00e4nger durchhalten\u201c.  \n691  \u201eWarum Wasser das wichtigste Lebensmittel ist\u201c ( prima , Heft 12, 1986): \u201e Strenggenommen sind Kaffee, \nBier, Tee und Wein vor allem Genu\u00dfmittel.

He then says that, despite the heightened caesium content in winter milk \n(due to the cattle being fed hay gathered in May), consumers should not give up milk since, \nas an optimal source of potassium and calcium, it h inders the stocking of caesium and \nstrontium in bodily tissues. 692  \n \nThe most significant article in this series is enti tled \u201cIs our food really quality food?\u201d. 693  It is \nactually based on an interview with Dr Fritz Weigan g 694  who discusses questions of definition \n(what is quality when it comes to food?) as well as  testing at various levels of production and \nat various stages of a product\u2019s lifespan, etc. The  most interesting issues pertain to the \naftermath of Chernobyl as well as the Austrian wine  scandal, 695  and questions include how \nconsumers can recognise good quality, the presence of additives or pollutants and how they \ncan be avoided, not to mention the relevance of org anic foods. In response to the first \nquestion, Dr Weigang enumerates a number of necessa ry knowledge collection steps such as \nthe external aspect of produce for vegetables and f ruit, labels, and personal testing. He \nemphasises the importance of suppliers and food sto res, encouraging consumers to \ncomplain about flawed products. But all these steps  appear rather lame when considering \neither the Austrian antifreeze scandal or the impac t of radiation contamination \u2013both of \nwhich are difficult or nigh impossible to detect fo r lay consumers. As to additives and \npollutants, the specialist answers: \n \nThere are dangerous substances such as environmenta l heavy metals, traces of insecticides, \nmedication or other preparations, such as hormones in meat. There are the mostly \nunavoidable preservatives that kill bacteria and mo uld. Colourings are dispensable, vitamins \nand trace elements are useful to enhance foods and prevent disease. Approximately 50 to 90 \npercent of heavy metals such as arsenic and lead on  the surface of vegetables can be \nremoved by e.g. washing, brushing and peeling. 696   \n \nFrom this answer, it appears that there are not man y strategies to avoid pollutants and that \neven the most worrying \u2013such as arsenic and lead\u2013 s eem to be considered as normal side-\neffects of industrial processing that can be remove d by careful home-processing. \nPreservatives seem equally unavoidable and it is ta ken for granted that vitamin and mineral \nenhancement is a GOOD thing. Against this backgroun d, it is rather unsurprising that Dr \nWeigang then states that comparisons between organi c-dynamic and conventional produce \nhave shown no quality differences. Finally, his ass essment of the food situation is that \n                                                 \n692  \u201eMilch: Welche Sorten es gibt, warum sie immer noc h gesund ist, wie sie frisch bleibt\u201c ( prima , Heft 11, \n1986). \n693  \u201eSind unsere Lebensmittel von bester Qualit\u00e4t?\u201c ( prima , Heft 11, 1986, p. 190) \n694  Dr Weigang is a management consultant for quality assurance as well as the chairman of the \u201cfood qual ity \nassurance\u201d research group at the German Society for  Quality [Unternehmensberater f\u00fcr Qualit\u00e4tssicherun g \nund Obmann des Arbeitkreises \u201cQualit\u00e4tssicherung be i Lebensmitteln\u201d der Deutschen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr \nQualit\u00e4t]. \n695  Most notably the Austrian antifreeze scandal of 19 85, cf. e.g.: Tagliabue, John, \u201cScandal over poison ed wine \nembitters village in Austria\u201d, New York Times , 02.08.1985: \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/02/world/scandal-ove r-poisoned-wine-embitters-village-in-austria.html . \n[website accessed March 2011] \n696  \u201eSind unsere Lebensmittel von bester Qualit\u00e4t?\u201c, o p. cit.: \u201eEs gibt sch\u00e4dliche Stoffe wie umweltbedingte \nSchwermetalle, R\u00fcckst\u00e4nde von Insektengiften, Arzne imitteln und anderen Pr\u00e4paraten, wie Hormone im Fle isch. \nEs gibt die meist unvermeidlichen Konservierungstof fe, die Bakterien und Pilze abt\u00f6ten.

Whole foods al so appear to be enjoying a \nbreakthrough with a special monthly \u201cSlim & healthy\u201d  feature in prima , which for the first \ntime programmatically blends light and healthy food s. 706  Another new feature in prima is \nrecipes for singles under the heading \u201cQuick and tasty\u201d  including e.g. \u201ctomato risotto\u201d  or \n\u201ccheese soup with toasted bread\u201d 707  or \u201cbaked banana with chocolate sauce\u201d .708  Microwave-\ncooking has also become a regular feature (e.g. \u201capricot and wine jelly\u201d  or \u201cpork roast with \napricots\u201d ). 709  And outdoor grilling, despite its reputed \u201chealthf ulness\u201d, raises concern about \ncarcinogenic fumes \u2013when hot fat drops on the glowi ng embers. 710  \n \nIn terms of staples, soy oil, Italian pasta and mue sli have joined the mainstream.

On the packa ging, one can read: \u201cFor your daily fitness: \nfrees and activates the body with active bifidus cu ltures\u201d . And the text goes on to explain \nhow the yogurt stimulates the intestine, making one  feel good and helping one to stay fit. 712  \nThere again, if only on the rhetorical and visual l evels, one witnesses the merging of two \n\u201cfitness\u201d realms: food and movement, since yogurt b ecomes a sort of fitness appliance that \nseems to unleash an amazing vitality. Technology, h ere in the guise of yogurt, seems to free \nthe body so that it can rediscover its natural ener gy. Concretely, the allusion to a fitness \nappliance also suggests that indoor training is bec oming normalised. \n \nAlong with the by then usual pizzas & noodles, conv enience food is especially represented by \ninnumerable sauces that are designed to be either c ooked with the food or eaten as dips and \nmayonnaises. The penetration and \u201cnatural\u201d dissemin ation of convenience and fast food in \ngeneral can be measured by an add for K\u00fchne featuri ng mustard, salad oil, red wine vinegar, \nand various Italian style tomato sauces. The headin g states \u201cQuick and festive\u201d  and goes on \nto explain: \n \nWho wants to be chained to the cooker when Father C hristmas is standing at the door? \nIndeed, there are so many presents to be packed or made by hand, cards to be written, not \nto mention the fact that one would also like to hav e a little time for oneself. Hence, even if it \ngets hectic before Christmas \u2013 just relax and enjoy  the K\u00fchne way\u2026 By the way: Christmas \ngrouches are bound to find an idea here for a quick  meal on Christmas Eve. \n \nThe double page then features \u201cquick tomato soup, spicy omelette, Friesland fry-u p, fruity \nred beet salad\u201d . A small inlaid picture shows three friends (a man  and two women) enjoying \na nice glass of wine along with the glow of candles . Thus apparently, excuses for \nincorporating convenience food \u2013even into a festive  meal traditionally requiring elaborate \nculinary preparations\u2013 need no longer be made. 713  In terms of convenience desserts, Dr \nOetker \u2019s Italian Zabaione complements the usual vanilla p uddings and chocolate mousses, \nthereby displaying the penetration of foreign speci alties into the rather conservative realm \nof puddings. 714   \n \nAdditionally, the \u201cfit\u201d discourse really seems to b e making its mark alongside a timid but \ngrowing functional food offer. The isostar  ad has become much more sober with a simpler \nslogan ( \u201cWhen you feel run down, isostar builds you up\u201d ) and explanations as well as a \n                                                 \n711  Ad for Uncle Ben\u2019s Vollkorn Reis ( prima , Heft 6, 1988): \u201e Er enth\u00e4lt noch so gut wie alle wichtigen Vitaminen , \nMineral- und Ballaststoffe des ungesch\u00e4lten Reiskor ns\u201c.  \n712  Ad for S\u00fcdmilch BA Bifidus Aktiv ( freundin , Heft 11, 1988): \u201e Immer mehr Frauen entdecken ein neues Fitness-\nGer\u00e4t\u201c; \u201eF\u00fcr Ihre t\u00e4gliche Fitness: befreit und akt iviert den K\u00f6rper mit Bifidus Aktiv Kulturen\u201c.  \n713  Ad for K\u00fchne products ( prima , Heft 1, 1988).: \u201e Festliches ganz auf die Schnelle\u201c; \u201eWer steht schon  gerne am \nHerd, wenn der Weihnachtsmann vor der T\u00fcr steht?

However, the emphasis in the ad is on the \nimportance of building complex carbohydrates reserv es in order to enhance performance \nand fitness. The ad shows an illustration of a man playing tennis as well as a small \nphotograph of Erberhard Gienger, a former gymnastic s world champion who helped develop \nand test the product line. It should be noted that both isostar  and Nesfit  seem to primarily \ntarget a masculine audience as confirmed by the gen der of the models and slogans such as \n\u201cFor stamina, strength and fitness\u201d , since endurance and strength are still strongly c onnoted \nas masculine attributes.  716    \n \nHowever, even more straightforward products \u2013such a s the BA yogurt mentioned above or \ngrape juice\u2013 use women and fitness as an argument. Concluding a long description of grape \njuice\u2019s effects on the organism, an ad concludes: \u201cGrape juice is nothing less than a fitness \ntreatment for your body\u201d . And the illustration shows a short-haired, sporti ly clad young \nwoman doing a one hand stand whilst holding a glass  of juice with a greedy look, as if she \nwere about to take a long sip. 717  Functional fruit juices such as Dr Koch \u2019s Trink 10  or Plus E  \nseem to enjoy a sustained popularity while being es pecially targeted at women. An \ninteresting argument surfaces in one of the ads, na mely that of the price associated with \ngood health. After extolling the vitamins in the dr ink, the model states: \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mind \npaying the price since, as I said, nothing is too p recious for my healthy diet\u201d .718  Even though \nthis argument does not seem to resurface in later a ds, it is symptomatic of a new perception \nof the ultimate value of health. Since contemporary  discourse does not yet associate beauty \nand maleness, an ad for Plus E justifies the use of  a woman model by using the following \ncaption below a photograph showing a female model a bout to sip from a glass of juice: \u201cYou \ncan do a lot for your beauty\u201d . The text further elaborates the point: \u201cBeauty includes bodily \nwell-being. You can do a lot towards it, including PLUS E, the juice with a lot of vitamin E. The \nvitamin that helps protect your cells against prema ture aging. Hence a daily glass of PLUS E \nfruit or vegetables should be part of your beauty r outine\u201d. 719  Other popular drinks include \nFixapfel , a new fruit herbal tea sold with the slogan \u201cAppetite for nature ,720  and an \ninteresting ad for Nescaf\u00e9 \u2019s Unser Bester  that, under the slogan \u201cI am so free [\u2026] and \nNescaf\u00e9 is part of it\u201d , shows a woman in an indeterminate setting laughin g on the phone \nwhilst holding a cup of coffee. The handwritten cap tion states: \u201cI live my life very \n                                                 \n715  Ad for Wander Isostar ( stern , Heft 42, 1987): \u201e Wenn sie abbauen, baut Isostar Sie wieder auf\u201c.  \n716  Ad for Nestl\u00e9 Nesfit products ( freundin , Heft 12, 1988): \u201e Sind sie wirklich fit?\u201c; \u201eEnergie-Aufbau M\u00fcsli, \nEnergie-Riegel, Fitness-Vollkorn-Drink, Energie-Vit amin-Block, ISO-Mineral-Drink in der Dose, ISO-Mine ral-Drink \nzum Anr\u00fchren, Magnesium-Brause-Tabletten, Eiwei\u00df 60  and Eiwei\u00dfriegel\u201c; \u201eF\u00fcr Ausdauer, Kraft und Fitnes s\u201c.  \n717  Ad for Traubensaft [Verein Pro Traubensaft, Bonn] ( Frau im Spiegel , Heft 26, 1988): \u201e Traubensaft ist \ngeradezu eine Fitness-Kur f\u00fcr Ihren K\u00f6rper.\u201c  \n718  Ad for Dr Koch\u2019s Trink 10 ( stern , Heft 46, 1987): \u201e Und das lass\u2019 ich mir auch etwas mehr kosten.

A long article \nin Brigitte  on lettuce varieties details botanical specifics, preservation tips, taste and \nappropriate combination. The introduction states: \u201cLettuce choice is increasing. There are \nmore and more varieties to be found in the vegetabl es department. We tell you what they \nare called and how they should be combined. And we don\u2019t mince matters about quality\u201d . 722  \nVarieties examined include among others: lollo ross o, lamb\u2019s lettuce, dandelion, radicchio, \noak leaf lettuce or arugula. The latter\u2019s incipient  success is heralded as follows: \u201cFrom weed \nto salad: nowadays arugula is sold as roquette or r ucola and is the next big thing. Arugula is \nmainly eaten in South Germany and is little known n orth of the Main\u201d .723  If anything, the \nlinguistic indication is another proof of how well a German product sells under the blessing \nof a French or Italian appellation\u2026 Two small blurbs  at the end of the article aim to teach the \nreader about vitamins as well \u201cnitrates & co\u201d . Unfortunately, the rationales invoked in the \nlatter appear more contradictory than really helpfu l: \n \nField-grown salads usually contain fewer nitrates t han salads from greenhouses and cloches: \nthe stronger luminosity in the field limits the nit rate concentration. When a salad gets little \nlight, its nitrate concentration is correspondingly  higher. This is why the light yellow lettuce \nheart, which is protected from the light by the lar ge outer leaves, contains more nitrates, \neven though the older, green leaves are able to sto re more of this substance. Thus it is \ndifficult to enounce a hard and fast rule. But remo ve the outer leaves because they contain \nmore environmental pollutants than salad hearts. 724  \n \nIf anything, these explanations are a good instance  of the environmental confusion triggered \nby an increasing number of food scandals. Surprisin gly though, there is no mention \nwhatsoever of alternative production methods such a s so-called integrated or organic \nfarming where pesticide/pollutant levels are consid erably lower or even negligible.  \n \nBut the main appeal of salads apart from their refr eshing aspect is described in a Bunte  \n\u201cLifestyle: eating + drinking\u201d  feature entitled \u201cSalad: take it lightly\u201d . A young healthy-looking \n                                                 \n721  Ad for Nescaf\u00e9 Unser Bester ( prima , Heft 6, 1988): \u201e Ich bin so frei [\u2026] Nescaf\u00e9 ist dabei\u201d; \u201eIch leb\u2019 m ein Leben \nganz spontan und nehme mir Zeit f\u00fcr die Dinge, die mir Spa\u00df  machen.\u201c  \n722  \u201eEs gr\u00fcnt so gr\u00fcn... und neuerdings auch rot\u201c ( Brigitte , Heft 8, 1989, pp. 284 ss.): \u201e Die Salatauswahl w\u00e4chst \nst\u00e4ndig, und immer neue Z\u00fcchtungen f\u00fcllen die Gem\u00fcs eregale.

The caption reads: \u201cRaw vegetable salads should be included in a summe r diet. Lots of \nvitamins and almost no calories (provided one is ca reful with the dressing). Good for the \nfigure\u201d .725  This represents the ultimate consecration of a foo d already connoted as \u201chealthy \ndiet stuff\u201d. The salad recipes themselves are becom ing more elaborate, expanding horizons \nbeyond the usual lettuce, potato, eggs, bacon or ha m components to include recipes such as \nbean salad with mushrooms, melon salad with mint, 726  as well as more elaborate or \nparadoxically heavy concoctions such as \u201cwild rice salad with scampi\u201d  or \u201ctortellini and bean \nsalad\u201d .727  \n \nOtherwise, beyond the usual summer grilling tips, a n interesting newcomer is Italian \n\u201cantipasti\u201d. 728  Eckart Witzigmann, the 3-star cook, 729  called upon as a food consultant for the \nBunte  \u201clifestyle\u201d features, sums up the musts of this pa rticular tradition, which can be \ninterpreted as a light summer meal by the harried G erman housewife ( \u201cThere are only \nstarters today. Antipasti like in Italy. Marinated,  au gratin, refined. Served with crusty bread \nand summer wine. Basta\u201d ): \n \nI particularly enjoy antipasti, these small delicac ies that are served before the pasta course \non hot summer days in Italy. The ingredients should  be of first-class quality and as fresh as \npossible. Extra virgin olive oil as well as high-qu ality balsamico or red-wine vinegar are a \nmust. Extra-thin shavings of air-dried ham (Parma o r San Daniele) as well as salami and coppa \nshould be cut just before serving. Figs, melon and freshly baked country bread should also be \nserved. 730   \n \nFinally, another interesting trend that will be tak en up even more enthusiastically at the end \nof the 1990s by health gurus such as Dr Strunz, are  milk-shakes. The cook quoted above \npraises these beverages under the heading \u201cIn the summer, shake instead of steak\u201d . After \nextolling the variety of ingredients that are avail able during the summer for these \nconcoctions, he ends with two health/nutritional ti ps. First, because of their many vitamins \nand minerals, milk shakes are described as \u201cthe perfect fitness conditioners for the heart, \nmuscles, nerves and the brain\u201d . He also contends that during the hot season, when  appetite \nwanes, shakes represent a perfect meal that satiate s without weighing on the stomach. \nMoreover, they also contain few calories \u2013depending  on the ingredients used (they should \nalways be prepared with low-fat milk).

However, it also \nstresses that \u201cOnly fresh ingredients are used for the production , no stabilisers or \nthickeners\u201d ,731  which hints to a growing concern over the healthfu lness of even \u201csinfully\u201d \nfattening treats... \n \nIt should be noted that even in winter, the trend g oes towards vegetable-rich dishes, e.g. an \nOctober feature on spinach in prima  that includes exotic delicacies such as \u201clamb curry with \nspinach\u201d  or \u201cspinach pasta with gorgonzola\u201d  amongst more mainstream recipes such as \n\u201cspinach soup\u201d  or \u201cGerman-style raviolis [Maultaschen] \u201d.732  Surprisingly, even tofu seems to \nhave migrated away from the vegetarian pages to ent er the mainstream in a December \nfeature of the same magazine. The rationale invoked  here is that: \u201cTofu really fits into a \n\u2018slim-diet\u2019 because it is healthy, low-calorie (onl y 71kcal/100g). Tofu contains little fat, hardly \nany cholesterol, many B-vitamins and a lot of iron\u201d .733  As a convenience health food, tofu \nalso seems to have made a breakthrough earlier on i n the year with the introduction of the \nNuxo tofu salad assortment presented in the same ma gazine. 734  \n \nArguments of speed, health and price all combine to  favour saut\u00e9ed all-in-one dishes (e.g. \ntomato and chicken breast casserole, fennel and car rot casserole), 735  fast dishes, under the \nheading \u201cSomething hot fast: 20 dishes that take 20 minutes  to prepare\u201d  promoted with the \nfollowing rationale: \u201cWhen you happen to be in a hurry, these super-dish es are exactly what \nyou need because one feels better with something wa rm in one\u2019s belly\u201d .736  Stews, but in a \nlighter disguise, remain popular for similar reason s, e.g. \u201cstew with carrots and cheese balls\u201d , \n\u201cstew with kohlrabi and meat balls\u201d , \u201cstew with fish, spinach and green asparagus\u201d 737   or \n\u201csweet and sour vegetable goulash\u201d. 738  \n \nForeign food also enjoys a definite breakthrough th at can be measured by the number of \nexotic ingredients or dishes comprised in otherwise  more conservative recipe features such \nas collectable ones. A good example can be found in  Brigitte: besides the unavoidable \n                                                 \n731  \u201eWenn\u2019s hei\u00df ist, bleib kalt\u201c ( Bunte , Heft 32, 02.08.90, pp. 64-65): \u201e Im Sommer: Shake statt Steak\u201c ; \u201e die \nidealen Fitmacher f\u00fcr Herz, Muskulatur, Nerven und Gehirn\u201c; H\u00e4agen Dazs:  \u201eF\u00fcr die Herstellung werden nur \nfrische Zutaten verwendet, keine Stabilisatoren ode r Bindemittel.\u201c  \n732  \u201eBlatt f\u00fcr Blatt Spinatgenu\u00df\u201c ( prima , Heft 10, 1990, pp. 152 ss.): \u201e Lammcurry mit Spinat\u201c, \u201eSpinatpasta mit \nGorgonzola\u201c, \u201eSpinatsuppe\u201c, \u201e Maultaschen\u201c.

A good example of the la tter is an article in Brigitte under the \nheading \u201cInternational Cuisine\u201d  presenting Syrian food from a migrant\u2019s perspectiv e. The \narticle entitled \u201cSyria\u2019s spicy cooking: naturally oriented towards whole foods\u201d  states the \nfollowing in its introduction:  \n \nSonia Hagemann has been living in the M\u00fcnster regio n for the past six years and is a bit \nsurprised: \u201cEverybody is now talking about whole fo ods in Germany. That has never been an \nissue in Syria since we have been eating like that for centuries. Lentils, rice, chick peas, \ncereals, nuts, fruit and yogurt are the basis of ou r cooking.\u201d And this isn\u2019t just healthy, it\u2019s \nalso really exciting! 741  \n \nEven political developments can pave the way for a cultural-gastronomic opening as in a \nstern article entitled \u201cA cuisine makes a state\u201d  with the following introduction: \u201cMost people \nare acquainted with caviar and borscht. But almost no one is aware of the variety to be \nfound in Russian cuisine. Thanks to glasnost and pe restroika, the other traditional foods of \nthis country are also worthy of our interest.\u201d 742  \n \nAs to products, the whole foods trend seems to be m aking its mark on most traditional \nstaples. Trends I previously addressed, when discus sing whole-wheat crisp-bread and muesli, \nare consolidated without additional health rational es. In contrast, an ad for wheat flour, \nAurora \u2019s Urweizen  emphasises new characteristics:  \n \nYou love nature. That\u2019s a good reason to choose Aur ora Urweizen. Indeed, the cereal grows \nwithout chemical insecticides or mineral fertilizer s. By choosing Aurora Urweizen, you \nsupport environmentally friendly grain cultivation for a naturally conscious diet. Aurora \nUrweizen is available as light flour, type 550k, da rk flour, type 1050 and whole wheat \nflower. 743  \n                                                 \n739  Sammelrezepte ( Brigitte , Heft 24, 1989): \u201e Schokoladen-Apfelkuchen mit Waln\u00fcssen\u201c, \u201c Rindsroul ade \u201aChop-\nSuey\u2019\u201d, \u201eHummer mit Zitronen-Aioli\u201c, \u201eOrientalisch gew\u00fcrzter Gem\u00fcse-Eintopf\u201c.  \n740  Cf. the prima feature \u201cCooking for friends\u201d  that appears regularly in the course of 1990, (\u201cKo chen f\u00fcr \nFreunde\u201d, prima , 1990). \n741  \u201eVon Natur aus vollwertig: Syriens w\u00fcrzige K\u00fcche\u201c ( Brigitte , Heft 22, 1989, pp. 250 ss.): \u201eSonia Hagemann \nlebt seit sechs Jahren im M\u00fcnsterland.

Mit Ihrer Entscheidung f\u00fcr Aurora Ur weizen unterst\u00fctzen Sie einen Umweltschonenden 184 \n \n \nWithout organic ever being mentioned as an overarch ing label, this discourse seems to point \ntowards at least an integrated type of agriculture.  It is one of the first mainstream ads to \nmention the desirability of actually avoiding pesti cides and mineral fertilizers. Furthermore, \nit is also one of the first mainstream ads (i.e. no t linked to a health-food shop) to describe \nconsumers\u2019 particular role in protecting the enviro nment through their nutritional choices.  \n \nAnother noteworthy development \u2013which despite its a pparent healthful consequences, \nstands in sharp contrast with the more ecological p hilosophy outlined above\u2013 is an \nincreasingly all-year round supply of formerly seas on-bound vegetables and fruit, as typified \nby ads for Dutch greenhouse produce. Pointedly, the  headings no longer refer to a seasonal \nappeal but simply state \u201cNow is Holland time!\u201d  above enraptured portraits of a man biting \ninto a tomato 744  or a woman eating cherries. 745  In both cases, the caption reads \u201cHaving fun, \nliving healthily, staying fresh\u201d . There again the health factor combined with fun s eems to \nhave become a major sales argument.  \n \nFinally, the most striking development is no doubt the one to be found in the meat realm, \nespecially cold cuts. Whilst fatty salami style mea t is still readily available and seemingly \npopular, ham is featured without the traditional th ick layer of fat 746  and turkey slices seem \nto enjoy a growing popularity. 747  But the most explicit ad is the one for French tur key cuts \nsold under the Chaillotine  and Maitre Coq  brand names and advertised by an extremely slim \nand elegant French beauty, dressed in a very tight- hugging lycra-style mini-dress, with a \nmetal belt underlining her slim waist. Other access ories include gloves, flat pumps, a hat and \nbulky plastic earrings. The accompanying text at th e level of the model\u2019s midriff reads \u201cWe \nmust admit that when you buy fresh French turkey yo u get very few calories for your money.\u201d  \nOn the other side of the ad, a very low-cal recipe is featured with approx. 114 kcal per 100g \nof meat. 748  Turkey is thus hailed as a prime \u201cweight-conscious  meat\u201d.  \n \nThe milk product world is relatively stable with th e habitual assortment of rich and creamy \ntraditional butter, yogurts and cheeses. Foreign st aples such as Cantadou  cream cheese \nremain popular. And while the diet assortment is br oadening, a few traditional brands try to \nadapt to the light trend. A good example here is Bayernland . Against a background featuring \ncream and cottage cheeses, a thoughtful fitness ade pt is portrayed, taking a break from her \nrowing machine routine under the following text: \n \nThe thing is: \u2026 A lot of protein and a little fat d o not exclude savouring Bayernland products. \nFirst of all, there is Bayernland soft cheese with spicy ingredients or pure to be mixed as you \n                                                                                                                                                         \nGetreideanbau f\u00fcr eine naturbewu\u00dfte Ern\u00e4hrung.

Second, the actual fat content is always l ower than that stated on the packaging \u201c% \nFD\u201d\u2019. So what you actually see here is the best \u201cfi tness-class\u201d, quality-taste: Bayernland! 749  \n \nThe distinction is an important one since e.g. 20% fat in the dry extract usually corresponds \nto approx. 4 g. fat per hundred grams since most \u201cm oist\u201d cheeses have a high water \npercentage, such as cottage cheese. But the ad does  stand in sharp contrast with another \nBayernland  ad promoting Gold Butter , with the help of a smiling, plump and presumably \nBavarian milkmaid \u2013wearing an apron and carrying a huge milk churn\u2013 who looks as if she \nhas never set eyes on a rowing-machine in her life.750  Within the cult of creaminess, one \nunusual speciality is worth mentioning that I did n ot detect before, i.e. \u201ccr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche\u201d  from \nFrance, a speciality that will become increasingly popular from the late 1990s onwards. 751   \n  \nThe fats realm is dominated by generic oils such as  Livio, presented as \u201cvitamin+\u201d  since it is \nrich in vitamin E and essential fatty acids and thu s make salads smile (veggies are arranged \naround the Livio nose to form a clown face) 752  or soy oil, praised because it is easy to digest, \nneutral in taste and extremely healthy since it is also rich in poly-unsaturated fatty acids. 753  \nAn ad for Mazola germ oil argues that briefly fryin g vegetables with germ oil is much \nhealthier than cooking them for too long in water w here they lose vitamins. It provides a \nquick vegetable casserole recipe to prove the point  and \u2013if needs be\u2013 once more illustrate \nhow popular this form of cooking has become. 754  A novelty is the assortment of special \n\u201cdiet\u201d oils (including safflower, soy, grapeseed, s unflower, peanut and pure germ oil) as well \nas oils flavoured with garlic, dill, tarragon, lemo n, 7 herbs, pure walnut oil, vegetable oil with \na touch of hazelnut oil, and cold-pressed olive oil . 755  This variety is gradually reflected in \nvarious salad recipes but still tentatively. Indeed , even today\u2019s staple olive oil is the object of \na text-rich ad by the \u201cOlive Oil Information Society\u201d  explaining all its health advantages and \nthe varieties it comes in (emphasising their variou s tastes \u2013in contrast with soy oil) as well as \nhow it should be used under the title \u201cOlive oil has a lot going for it\u201d . Apart from a \nparticularly high percentage of vitamins (especiall y E) and trace elements, what distinguishes \nolive oil from its competitors \u2013according to the ad \u2013 is the following:  \n \nIts combination of linoleic and oleic acids make it  almost ideal for the human body. Olive oil \ncontains a large amount of unsaturated fatty acids and thus controls the level of cholesterol. \nIt is the only oil that reduces the LDL-level, i.e.  the harmful cholesterol, while maintaining the \npositive HDL-cholesterol. There are no additives in  olive oil. 756   \n                                                 \n749  Ad for Bayernland Kerniger Frischk\u00e4se, Farmi, Farm i soft mit franz\u00f6sischen Kr\u00e4uter, Farmi soft mit \nMeerrettich ( Brigitte , Heft 21, 1989): \u201e Die Sache ist die: \u2026Viel Eiwei\u00df und wenig Fett schl ie\u00dft Bayernland-Genu\u00df \nnicht aus.

Nevertheless, \nolive oil is the first serious competitor of becel  diet oil, whose ads use a similar rhetoric but \nwith a much more curative than preventive approach,  since the ad is introduced by the \nfollowing dialogue snippet: \u201c\u2018Just Asparagus\u2019, he sulked, \u2018because of cholester ol\u2019. \u2018Cheer up\u2019, \nshe comforted him, \u2018I have a solution\u2019.\u201d 757  Otherwise, a new diet margarine has appeared on \nthe market. In 1988, the campaign for L\u00e4tta  surprisingly targets both genders, one of the \nfirst instances of a \u201cunisex\u201d slimming product. 758  The text runs thus: \n \nHave you decided to never get fat? Then you know th at you have to do something about it. \nTo live consciously. To be active. To eat right. L\u00e4 tta would like to help you a little in the \nprocess. L\u00e4tta boasts only half the fat of margarin e and butter.  \n \nOne of the illustrations of the campaign boasts a c onfident and smiling male model: he is \ndressed in yellow shorts and a sleeveless T-shirt a nd sits legs spread apart. To further \nenhance his virile posture, he holds a towel \u2013which  rests on the back of his neck\u2013 with both \nhands, thus enabling his muscular arms to bulge sli ghtly. The damp effect on his skin is a \nproof that he is indeed a dynamic, responsible pers on who consciously designs his body \nthrough both intensive sports and adequate nutritio n. 759   \n \nAs to convenience food, the by now usual frozen veg gies, frozen dishes as well as sauces and \nmayonnaises form the backbone of the offer, but eve n the latter often vaunt a particularly \n\u201chealthy\u201d characteristic, e.g. Appel \u2019s so-called Salat-freshing ,760  a yogurt and dill salad \ndressing, does not contain preservatives and Thomy \u2019s yogurt salad cream contains 71% less \noil than conventional mayonnaise (replaced by yogur t). 761  Other novelties advertised are \nfrozen vegetables, this time in a cream sauce, 762  pre-baked baguettes, 763  frozen herbs, dip \nspice mixes such as Fuchs \u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s dip\u201d , described as \u201c4 exciting evening-filling spice blends, \ntzatziki, spring herbs, Tuscany, onion.

Indeed, even if men also read women\u2019s magazines, women \nare still often the purveyors/choosers of food, cos metics and sometimes even clothes in family-type \nhouseholds. Thus the embedding of ads seemingly dir ected at men in a woman\u2019s magazine may simply sugge st \nthat women are trusted lifestyle mediators for thei r men.  \n759  Ad for L\u00e4tta ( freundin , Heft 9, 1988): \u201e Haben sie sich entschieden, niemals dick zu werden?

But \nwith less than 5% fat!\u201d , Milano salad ( \u201cwith yogurt and whole wheat or vegetarian: refined  \nand delicious salads\u201d ), gouda ( \u201cthis delicious type of cheese lacks nothing except  fat\u201d ), salami \n(\u201cjuicy and powerful as well as 40% less fat: sausag es and meats\u201d ). And the caption above \nthe products reads like a modern creed for eating r ight: \u201cProVital is really delicious and \nprovides many variations on modern pleasure: health y, wholesome, with very little fat and \nquality ingredients. Enjoy your meal\u201d . This discourse thus differs from contemporary \nslimming assortments such as Du darfst,  the main emphasis of which is on calorie-counting.  \n \nWhen it comes to desserts, two main orientations ca n be detected. First there are the \nseductive, creamy, almost forbidden sweets such as chocolate or ice-cream with motifs \nemphasising sensuality and potentially explicit \u201cse xual\u201d sin such as e.g. in an ad for Sprengel \nEdel Vollmilch  chocolate, showing a woman in a suit grabbing a ma n passing by with the \nstatement \u201cI want Sprengel\u201d 768  or an ad for Carte d\u2019Or  ice-cream under the caption \u201cA good \nreason to be unfaithful\u201d  (not to mention the added \u201cReserved for climaxes\u201d  at the bottom of \nthe ad). 769  Both seem to hint to the fact that eating sweet & fatty foods has become a \nsecretive, quasi-forbidden pleasure. This contrasts  with lighter desserts that can be eaten \nwith less of a bad conscience such as Dr Oetker \u2019s Rote and Gr\u00fcne Gr\u00fctze  \u2013i.e. stewed red or \ngreen berries\u2013 or the new Langnese blood orange flavoured yogurt  ice cream (in tubs and \ncones), which benefit from the positive aura of fru it and yogurt. 770   \n \nAs to hot drinks, under the guiding stars of French  and Italian tastes, the demand for light \ncoffee that dominated the 1980s seems to be declini ng in favour of avowedly more robust \naromas, as in ads for Eduscho \u2019s Bonjour \u2013\u201cirresistibly spirited beans\u201d \u2013 or for the Mini \nCappuccino Luxe  coffee machine manufactured by Krups .771  Tea is the object of a \u201cfitness\u201d \ncampaign by the German Tea Bureau.  One of the ads shows a tennisman lightly springing  \nover the net and the other shows two women jogging in tracksuits, t-shirts, headbands, \nlegwarmers und trainers. The following text is high lighted in both ads: \u201cTea is it \u2026 Real tea \nfosters everything: enjoyment, the ability to conce ntrate, relaxation, freshness and fitness. \nAnd all that without calories! Well-known brands pr ovide variety and taste. Real tea.

Moreover, foreign mineral waters ar e penetrating the market, e.g. Volvic , \nContrex and San Pellegrino . Most ads move from an impersonal rhetoric to a pe rsonal or \nbody-/fitness-oriented discourse: from \u00dcberkinger  showing a woman who has fallen while \nroller-skating and who is trying to rather lamely b ut laughingly hoist herself up again using a \nlectern to support herself ( \u201c\u00dcberkinger helps you get back on your feet\u201d ), 775  to Contrex  \ndisplaying a muscular (but not overslim!) woman in a dance posture near the prow of a boat \n(\u201cActive individuals feel good. No wonder, since the y live more consciously and enjoy healthy \neating\u201d ). 776   \n \nA particularly interesting series of ads for Heppinger  water elaborates on the lifestyle \nfunction of water consumption. One of them displays  a man in his late thirties, attired in a \ntracksuit and lounging on a couch. He sports a broa d toothy smile, his right hand propping \nup his cheek. The other hand clasps the glass of wa ter perched on his left knee. A bottle of \nHeppinger is nestled against his belly. The heading  reads: \u201cI am a Heppinger. Because it suits \nme. Fit, active, naturally Heppinger: lots of miner als, particularly magnesium. That makes \none physically and mentally fit. It feels good and provides the right momentum. \u2018Source of \nthe active\u2019, that sounds just right\u2026 Heppinger. And  I feel heppi.\u201d 777  The setting here is truly \nleisurely: the man is wearing sports gear but the f olds of the track suit top fall loosely on his \nreclined figure. Even if he has presumably been exe rcising before taking a break, his body \nshows no signs of strain or exhaustion. Just as in the Hirschquelle  example quoted higher, \nthis mineral water also seems to have a holistic ef fect: on the performance of both body and \nmind (hence also work performance) but also on gene ral well-being and mood. Moreover, \n\u201cSource of the active\u201d  may seem to contradict the generally lazy atmosphe re of the picture \nbut it thereby hints to the fact that activity is t aken for granted: the man no longer has to \nprove anything; he can just dwell in the moment \u2013 i n \u201cpure and natural\u201d wellness style.  \n \n                                                 \n772  Ads for tea ( Brigitte , Heft 9, 1989 and Brigitte , Heft 8, 1989 respectively): \u201eTee bringt\u2019s \u2026 Echter Tee hat alles \nf\u00fcr Genu\u00df, Konzentrationsf\u00e4higkeit, Entspannung, Fr ische und Fitness.

Und ich f\u00fchl\u2019 mich \nheppi.\u201c . 189 \n \nThis attitude contrasts with that found in a twin a d displaying a woman in jeans, T-shirt and \ntrainers, taking a break on a stone in a natural, m ountain-like setting. Her posture seems to \nhave more dynamic potential despite her coy, reflex ive expression. And the text reflects this \nreadiness (or is it just the reflection of a societ al imperative that pushes women to work \nmore than men for their beauty?): \u201cWhy am I in such good shape? Because I am very act ive: \na lot of movement, a conscious diet and, naturally,  Heppinger as a drink. It contains a lot of \nmagnesium, enhances performance and makes one fit. Hence I feel wide awake \u2013both bodily \nand mentally. Clearly, my source of the active is H eppinger. And I feel heppi\u201d .778  A year later \ndespite a similar format \u2013same slogan, full body po rtrait and text in the first person\u2013 the \nmood has shifted. A smiling woman lounges in a deck -chair in such a way as to show off her \nlong, slim and bronzed legs and holds a glass of wa ter close to the bottle nestling near her \nknees. The text has become more direct, aggressive and self-confident: \u201cOf course I\u2019m active. \nAnd I can show off at the beach, can\u2019t I?\u201d  and the text goes on to extol Heppinger  and its \ncontribution to well-being and a body \u201cin good shape\u201d .779   \n \nAn ad for Hirschquelle  from the same year shows that the holistic impact of the water has \nbeen integrated and need not rely on a surfeit of e xplanations since the ad simply states \u201cFor \nbody and mind\u201d  above a table with a bottle of Hirschquelle  and a glass against a background \ndisplaying the shadow of a slim and pretty woman, o ne hand resting on the top of her head \nin a sort of \u201cthinker posture\u201d and the other arm gr acefully arched above her head like a \ndancer. The caption beneath the picture says \u201cHirschquelle tastes good and does one \ngood\u201d .780  Otherwise, novelty in the mineral water field is f lavoured water, usually with citrus \nfruit. The ad for e.g. Apollinaris Lemon  states the following: \u201cApollinaris Lemon. Made with \nnatural mineral water and a touch of lemon. Nothing  else. No colourings or artificial \nflavourings. No sugar. Taste without calories. Exci tingly fresh.\u201d 781  It is the first example I have \nfound of an ad explicitly emphasising the absence o f both colourings and artificial aromas, \nnot to mention sugar \u2013and this without an artificia l sweetener to compensate.  \n \nThis mineral water craze can be partially explained  by the suspicions surrounding tap water, \nespecially its high pesticide and nitrate content, caused by groundwater contamination with \nfertilisers -not to mention high levels of chlorina ted hydrocarbons as a by-product of the \ndisinfection of 35% of the water supply. An article  in prima  warns against these conditions \npointing to discrepancies between the lax national tolerance of 50 mg pro litre vs. European \nrecommendations of max. 25 mg pro litre:  \n \nAnd here this value is exceeded in many places. [the article provides a table listing the most \nnitrate-rich locations] . Of course, one can pointedly argue about prescrip tive limits and, as \noften, the question \u201cdangerous or not?\u201d can only be  conditionally answered. The only sure \n                                                 \n778  Ad for Heppinger Heilwasser ( Brigitte , Heft 24, 1989): \u201e Warum ich so gut in Form bin?

Aufregend frisch.\u201c  190 \n \nthing is that the less nitrate, the better. Nobody is as \u201ctolerant\u201d as we are when it comes to \nnitrates in Europe. Hence: when nitrate level excee ds 25 mg per litre, one should go easy on \ntap water. 782  \n \nThe article then preaches caution with small childr en, especially when fed vegetables \ncontaining high nitrate concentration and recommend s the use of bottled mineral water that \nis explicitly labelled as suitable for children. An other article, this time in Bunte  and with a \nlifestyle orientation, praises still mineral water as the hot new trend in the summer of 1990. \nThe article starts by saying that in the past, peop le would be ashamed to order water in a \nrestaurant because of the reaction of the waiters a nd other guests, whereas nowadays one \nis embarrassed if one does not order a specific wat er brand and one is entitled to berate the \nwaiter if the restaurant does not offer a particula rly fashionable brand. The mineral water \nboom is then illustrated by quoting figures: West G ermans consume 80 litres per person per \nyear (a world record) compared to just 14 litres in  1970. The article goes on to report that:  \n \nAccording to Munich\u2019s famous party caterer K\u00e4fer, s ince fitness and health have become a \nphilosophy, the turnover for mineral water knows \u201ca lmost no limits\u201d. Arnold Wolters, the \nmarketing director at Apollinaris [a mineral water company] , confirms this trend: \u201cespecially \nthe so-called still varieties with little carbonic acid are booming\u201d. 783  \n \nStrikingly, this is the first reference to fitness and health having become trends on a societal \nscale. The article ends with a list of mineral wate r benefits \u2013the first being zero calories!\u2013 \nand provides tips on water etiquette, label deciphe ring and taste linked to mineral content. \nOther features include a blurb on how two glasses o f \u201cstrong\u201d mineral water can help \ncombat hangovers, an eating-out tip advertising a r estaurant where one can order four \ndifferent types of mineral water (and 800 types of wine!), a guidebook on mineral water and \na satirical drink column where the author praises w ater but admits to a preference for \nanother type of bubbly\u2026 The tenor of this article is  particularly emblematic of the new \ntrend: mineral water is no longer treated as either  taken for granted or as a marginal \nphenomenon for \u201celderly\u201d and/or \u201cboring\u201d health-con scious consumers, instead it is treated \nwith the same passion and respect as wine or beer.  \n \nEarly 1990s: Glocal, slowfast and techno-natural \u2013 dualities reconciled  \nThe first half of the 1990s is characterised by ext remely varied recipes that can be truly \ndefined as creolised since they play on traditional  ingredients or dishes with a contemporary \ntwist (i.e. often prepared with less fat and with l ighter or no sauces) while integrating \nunusual or formerly luxury ingredients (such as exp ensive fish, seafood, saffron or high \nquality lean meats). Moreover, they often rely on f oreign foods (e.g. spices galore), relatively \nnovel or rediscovered cooking methods (such as grat in, 784  stir-frying, 785  cooking in \n                                                 \n782  \u201eWas ist drin im Trinkwasser?

Furthermore, whole foods , vegetarian 788  and (near-)foreign food \n(especially Italian) or exotic touches are often no rmalised in recipes. Cooking methods range \nfrom the extremely simple and relatively fast all-i n-one methods to very elaborate time-\nintensive processes (perhaps heralding the subseque nt slow food trend?). It is difficult to \nassign a particular style to a particular occasion.  Often, a relaxed experience with guests or \nthe ability to react spontaneously and prepare some thing fast is valued more than elaborate, \nstressful menus. But sometimes the latter are also recommended for special occasions and \nintimate get-togethers. Recipes thus range from \u201csalmon fillet baked with a horseradish \ncrust\u201d to \u201clamb\u2019s lettuce with deep-fried noodles and scallop s\u201d , \u201cwholemeal pasta tubes with \na cheese filling\u201d , \u201cradicchio pasta\u201d , \u201ctea foam with exotic fruits\u201d , \u201cbraised rabbit Italian-\nstyle\u201d , \u201cartichokes with a caper and pepper sauce\u201d , etc. 789   \n \nInterestingly, rice is again the object of a signif icant push. stern , for example, features it in a \nspecial \u201cEssen & Trinken\u201d  [Eating & Drinking] article with the following sta tement: \u201cIn the \npast, there were two types of rice to choose from a t the grocer\u2019s: \u2018soup rice\u2019 on one side of \nthe shelf and \u2018pudding rice\u2019 on the other. Sad time s. Today, we have the choice between \ngreen or red rice, between brown rice and parboiled  rice, Italian risotto rice or Japanese \nsticky rice\u201d .790  In prima , I also found an article entitled \u201cRice tastes international\u201d  with the \nfollowing caption: \u201cIt is especially healthy and is offered in many va rieties. And: it is found in \nall the world\u2019s cuisines\u201d  Recipes range from seafood risotto, to Turkish stu ffed peppers and \ntomatoes as well as lamb biryani [ \u201cLammfleisch mit Reis\u201d ]. 791    \n \nOtherwise seasonal ingredients continue to be featu red. If they are sometimes the object of \na traditional revival, such as meat specialties wit h pears or plums, even staples such as \npotatoes are subjected to daring modernist touches,  such as mashed potatoes mixed with \npoppy seeds or with yogurt and curcuma. 792  But the truly creolised nature of contemporary \nGerman cooking is probably best symbolised by a reg ular \u201cmenschen + genu\u00df\u201d  [people + \npleasure] feature in the Bunte  magazine.

All these \ntrends will become very representative of contempor ary German cooking and eating habits. \nIndeed, by stating that \u201cPreserving is modern again. 1. It tastes so person al 2. working in the \nkitchen is the in thing\u201d , the first article revives a discourse on the deli ghts of traditional \nhome-cooking made with love, hard work and patience , thus also heralding the slow-food \nfashion. 793  Nevertheless, the article\u2019s paradoxical title, i.e . \u201cMama, the preserves factory\u201d , \nshould be noted since it highlights the apparent co ntradiction of a return to pre-industrial \nfood-preparation in the modern domestic realm, whil e still hinting at a rather conservatively \ngendered labour division \u2013beyond a potentially humo rous intent. At any rate, this \n\u201chome/mama-made\u201d ethic stands in stark contrast wit h the \u201cmodern primitive\u201d or \u201cchildish\u201d \nfun of eating with one\u2019s fingers and mix-n-matching  what one likes as described in the \nsecond article. 794  On a mitigating note, however, it should be stated  that \u201cstuffed zucchini \nflowers\u201d  or \u201cpoussin legs\u201d  dipped in \u201cdivine sauces\u201d  \u2013the ingredients highlighted in the \nsubtitle\u2013795  hint to a great deal of sophistication in terms of  both product choice and \npreparation, thus contrasting with the hands-on app roach to ingesting ... Finally, the last \narticle broaches the topic of the heart-healthy \u201cMe diterranean diet\u201d:  \n \nThe recipe comes from Crete and, even in winter, yo u can obtain all the ingredients in \nGermany from the farmers\u2019 markets. It is this easy,  healthy diet based on olive oil, \nvegetables, dark bread and dried fruits that gives the inhabitants of Crete a long life \nexpectancy. In Crete, there are almost no cases of heart attack. It is thanks to Cretan cooking \n\u2013 with a lot of garlic, onions, fresh herbs, ewe\u2019s milk cheese, yogurt and honey, grilled fish, \npoultry and \u2013 a lot of salad. 796  \n \nThis description reunites all the elements of our l ate modern food creed: from the vitamins, \nminerals, antioxydants, enzymes and fibre from non- refined cereals, fruit, vegetables and \n\u201cexotic\u201d seasonings, to the lean protein of fish or  poultry, the calcium inherent in  yogurt and \newe\u2019s milk cheese (two \u201ceasy-to-digest\u201d dairy optio ns), to the appropriate fats provided by \nolive oil and fish.  \n \nAs far as other ethnic cuisines are concerned, it h as become increasingly difficult to draw the \nline between pure German tradition and unusual exot ic delicacies. Parallel streams and \ncrossover experimenting seem to rule the day. Forei gn cuisines no longer seem to be just \nappreciated for their \u201cotherness\u201d but because they are e.g. like Chinese food \u201ceasy to digest, \nlow-calorie and healthy. And the dishes are easy an d quick to prepare\u201d ,797  or because, \ndespite the simplicity of the staple used \u2013such as pasta in Italian food, the knack of a special \n                                                 \n793  Ritter, Wolfgang, \u201eKonservenfabrik Mama\u201c ( Bunte , Heft 41, 05.10.1995, pp. 78 ss.): \u201eEinmachen ist wieder \nmodern. 1.

The article pointedly sums up development s for the 1980s and the incipient 1990s: \n \nIn the 1980s, the techniques of the French-inspired  \u201cnouvelle cuisine\u201d became widespread: \nnearly every high-end restaurant began to serve dis hes on enormous plates decorated with \nsauces and side-dishes. Germans\u2019 nutritional consci ousness also evolved. The often meatless \ndishes from the Mediterranean area became de rigueu r, just as the light Asian cuisine \u2013 \npreferably cooked in a wok to preserve vitamins. In  the 1990s, the food palette in \nsupermarkets continued to grow. Pots of tiramisu an d mousse au chocolat could be found in \nthe refrigerated section. Asian convenience dishes such as bami- or nasi-goreng were already \navailable in the frozen section. And where previous ly Erbswurst [convenience dried ground \npeas with added ingredients compressed into a sausa ge shape and used to prepare pea soup]  \nand packet soups ruled the shelves, various powders  and flavour enhancers promising the \nsuccessful preparation of \u201coriginal\u201d Greek or Asian  dishes have mushroomed. Currently, the \nindustry is bent upon expanding the young megatrend , namely Mexican cuisine. 804   \n                                                 \n798  \u201ePasta wie vom Italiener\u201c ( prima , Heft 5, 1992, pp. 129 ss.).  \n799  Regularly recurring feature in the course of 1992 ( prima , 1992).  \n800  \u201eImmer ein Fest\u201c ( stern , Heft 46, 05.11.1992, pp. 246 ss.). \n801  Bettermann, Stella, \u201eMulti-Kulti-K\u00fcche.

Sim ilarly, an ethnic food experience in a restaurant i s more \nreadily embraced (on an occasional basis) by 51% of  the younger population as opposed to 24% in the ol der \none.   \n804  Ibid., p. 180: \u201eIn den 80ern machten sich die Gepflogenheiten der franz\u00f6sisch inspirierte \u201cNouvelle Cuisine\u201d \nbreit: Nahezu in jedem besseren Restaurant wurden S peisen auf riesigen Tellern \u00e4sthetisch \u201can\u201d Saucen und \nBeilagen dekoriert.

Derzeit setzt die Industrie au f die \nAusweitung des jungen Megatrends, der mexikanischen  K\u00fcche.\u201c 194 \n \n \nAnother interesting piece of information contained in the article is a list showing the likely \npercentile turnover increase for various food group s: pasta (79%), coffee (63%), vegetable oil \n(48%), frozen convenience meals (46%), dry convenie nce meals (39%), delicatessen (37%), \nfruit & vegetable (28%), non-dry convenience meals (26%), sauces (24%), stew/vegetables \n(22%). 805  The triumph of pasta as an inescapable favourite s tarchy side- or main dish is \nparticularly noteworthy, not to mention the perhaps  more predictable success of \nconvenience foods in general (including delicatesse n) as well as vegetable oils (olive etc. as \nopposed to animal fats) or coffee (with the incipie nt vogue of Italian coffee specialties). 806   \n \nAs to products, tradition has not died out but trie s to speak to the late modern consumer. \nEmblematic of this trend are the rather ambivalent CMA  ads. One ad shows a lump of butter \ndissolving in a sauce whilst vaunting the pleasurab le merits of regional German food as well \nas a cookbook with the significant title of \u201cSavouring in plain German\u201d  [Geniessen auf gut \ndeutsch]. 807  But in the same year another ad entitled \u201cFitness in three gears\u201d  [Fitness in drei \nG\u00e4ngen] counterbalances the pleasure discourse with  health rhetoric. It shows a family on \nbikes touring the German countryside in the top hal f of the ad, while the bottom half \ndisplays protein-rich (but lean) roast beef, carboh ydrate-rich milk (thanks to lactose), a dish \nwith butter shells that promise easy digestion and added energy thanks to milk fat and, \nfinally, a piece of blue cheese providing both prot ein and easy to digest milk fat. The magic \nrecipe according to the ad is \u201cMovement and a healthy balanced diet with foods fr om \nGermany. They contain protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins and mineral, plus they are the \nideal combination to make you fit.\u201d 808  \n \nThis health/pleasure dichotomy is emblematic of man y assortments or products. For \nexample an ad for Champignon  brie-type cheese shows almost identical photograph s \nfeaturing a slice of cheese on a knife with a piece  of broken baguette under the same \ncaption \u201cGourmets relish it pure\u201d . But one of the ads is for the \u201cExtra creamy deluxe\u201d  while \nthe other is for the \u201cCreamy taste the light way\u201d .809  The same is valid for another traditional \nproduct like Rama  margarine, offered in both the usual \u201cbreakfast-qu ality\u201d and the \n\u201cbalance\u201d variety with 25 % less fat. 810  Another type of compromise is that emblematised by  \ntraditional products boasting an exotic note such a s Milram \u2019s Quark [curd cheese] Classico \nthat comes in three additional varieties: Malaga , Zabaione  or Messina .811   \n \nIn the convenience realm, one also observes a mind split. Because convenience food has \nbecome so mainstream, it now no longer requires com plicated \u201cjustification\u201d rationales but \ncan play on a lighter note, as displayed by ads for  McCain \u2019s potato specialties [ 1\u00b72\u00b73 \nKroketten, Fritatoes & Barbecues ] showing a cowboy enjoying a large portion of \u201cFritatoes\u201d  \nwhilst his more unfortunate, tied up companion plea ds to be released or a Woody Allen type \n                                                 \n805  Ibid., p. 177. \n806  E.g. ad for Lavazza ( Bunte , Heft 42, 1995).  \n807  CMA ad for German agricultural products ( Bunte , Heft 41, 1995). \n808  CMA ad for German agricultural products ( stern , Heft 41, 1995): \u201eBewegung und eine gesunde, \nausgewogene Ern\u00e4hrung mit Nahrungsmitteln aus Deuts chland.

Good \nexamples include Heidemark \u2019s so-called Fitlets , i.e. turkey breasts blended with peas and \ncarrots and \u201cbreaded\u201d in corn flakes, promoted with  the caption \u201clight & ready to eat\u201d ,813  a \nnew iglo  \u201cGreen Cuisine\u201d  frozen veggie line, including items such as \u201cmixed vegetables in a \ncream sauce, Italian vegetable stew, vegetable grat in, vegetable stew\u201d  but also more \nelaborate concoctions under the label \u201cVegetables Plus\u201d : e.g. vegetables with rye and \nsunflower seeds or vegetable with both patna and wi ld rice, reflecting the trend towards \nwhole foods cooking but without the hassle. 814  Even vitamins are thematised as in the new \nLivio Plus  salad dressings with added vitamins E, B1 and B6 i n five varieties. 815  But, in this \ncontext, an even more surprising ad should be menti oned: an ad for tins as containers and \nvitamin preservers. On the left, it displays a pill  with the caption \u201cVitamins in small cans\u201d  [or \n\u201cdoses\u201d since there is a play on words in German] a nd a tin in which peaches are reflected \nwith the caption \u201cVitamins in large cans\u201d  [id.]. The accompanying text reads: \u201cVitamins \nevaporate when in contact with air, which is why th ey should be enclosed in an air- and light-\ntight can. That\u2019s how you can get your vitamin dose  e.g. with a juicy peach rather than a \nbitter pill. Tinplate. Good when full. Good when em pty.\u201d  Besides the implicit paradox \ninherent in the criticism of industrial vitamins wh ile extolling industrial preservation, it is the \nstill unusual environmental dimension that is notew orthy, since the tinplate [Wei\u00dfblech] \nrecycling logo also stars at the bottom of the ad. 816  Ecological responsibility also surfaces \nbriefly in an ad for Saupiquet \u2019s tuna fish salads that guarantees a catch without  driftnet and \npromises that the southeast Pacific area has been a voided. Since Saupiquet  is a French \nbrand, 817  the latter ad plausibly seems to hint at the Murur oa and Fangataufa atolls (French \nPolynesia), a French nuclear testing ground for thr ee decades. 818  \n                                                 \n812  Ads for McCain Fritatoes, Barbecues & Kroketten ( Bunte , Heft 42, 1995 & Bunte , Heft 46, 1995).  \n813  Ad for Heidemark Truthahn Fitlet ( Brigitte , Heft 6, 1992).: \u201e leicht & fertig\u201c  \n814  Ad for Iglo Gr\u00fcne K\u00fcche ( Brigitte , Heft 10, 1995) ( prima , Heft 11, 1992) ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 24, 1992): \u201e Buntes \nRahmgem\u00fcse, Italienisches Pfannengem\u00fcse, Gem\u00fcseaufl auf, Gem\u00fcseintopf\u201c; \u201eGem\u00fcse Plus\u201c.  \n815  Ad for Livio plus ( Brigitte , Heft 10, 1995). \n816  Ad for Wei\u00dfblech Recycling from the Informations-Z entrum Wei\u00dfblech e.V.: \u201eVitamine in kleinen Dosen\u201c; \n\u201eVitamine in gro\u00dfen Dosen\u201c; \u201eAn der frischen Luft h auen Vitamine ab.

A first example is the ad for Iglo \u2019s Delite  \u201cChicken fillet in a Hollandaise sauce \nwith rice and gourmet vegetables\u201d  that comes with the caption \u201cNatural taste requires no \nflavour enhancer\u201d  \u2013both \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cno\u201d are in a bigger font. 819  Another good example is \nan ad for Flora spreads that states \u201cThe only thing that we try to preserve is your health\u201d and \nthe text goes on as follows: \n \nA balanced diet is important for your health. We wo uld like to make it really tasty for you: \nwith Flora\u2019s pure vegetable-based spreads. Only sel ect vegetables are used to produce these \nspreads with great care. That is why Flora boasts o nly the best ingredients. Nothing else. \nWhat remains is the full natural taste. [\u2026] Experim ent with healthy pleasure .820   \n \nOtherwise, \u201chealthy\u201d snacks in the shape of bars co ntaining crunchy cereal flakes, dried fruit \nand/or chocolate seem to be really ubiquitous. 821  \n \nBut functional food is really driven by the aggress ive becel  campaigns mostly displaying \nclose-ups of seemingly hefty and greasy sandwiches (with cheese and mayonnaise oozing \nout of every pore) or a more refined assortment of open sandwiches. Appropriately, the first \nad states \u201cWhoever still claims that healthy eating means ren ouncing has missed something\u201d  \nand then presents an assortment of mayonnaise as we ll as vegetable, cheeseish and meatish \nspreads made with linoleic acid. The second ad decl ares: \u201cAs you can see, a cholesterol-\nconscious diet spells more and more pleasure. Eight  small revolutions from becel.\u201d  It then \npresents similar products including hard cheese and  cream-cheese substitutes or coffee-\nwhitener. 822   \n \nDuring this period, food (including its origins, pr oduction, control, etc.) seems to star much \nmore regularly in the media and these concerns are even reflected in some CMA  ads. After \nconcerns were raised about fertilizers and high nit rate contents in agricultural products \n(especially lettuce) and water, an ad vaunting the merits of so-called \u201cintegrated production\u201d \nhardly comes as a surprise. Under the heading \u201cTested and found good\u201d , the ad \u2013over a \ndouble page\u2013 shows two apple close-ups: one constel lated with small labels/blurbs and the \nother with the logo \u201cfrom integrated production\u201d . The small blurbs detail the characteristics \nof the label (e.g. \u201cpriority use of biological and mechanical means fo r pest management, \nobservation of pest epidemics and thus a significan tly reduced use of chemicals.

The accompanying explanatory  text entitled \u201ca meal made of genuine \ngroats and corn\u201d  details the components of the pig feed ( \u201cfreshly kibbled wheat, barley and \noats, rapeseed or soy groats, whey fresh from the d airy as well as vitamins and an extra \nportion of minerals\u201d ), whereby most of the wheat comes from the farmer\u2019 s own integrated \nproduction in the example provided here. Interestin gly, the feed description reads like a \nstriking parallel of a whole foods muesli recipe. B ut just as for the whole foods bought in \nsupermarkets, the article shows that the farmer use s a computer [picture provided] to \ndetermine the quantities required by each pig as we ll as the cost of ingredients. A \ncomputerised process also blends the ingredients fr om the various silos and ensures timely \ndistribution. Nevertheless, as if to reassure the c onsumer faced with such technological \nintrusion into \u201cnatural\u201d production, the text empha sises that nothing can replace the \nfarmer\u2019s gaze when it comes to assessing the health  of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\u2026 824  \n \nOtherwise, three articles in Brigitte  tackle the organic question. The first one examine s how \norganic produce is set to conquer supermarkets: \u201cBread made with genuine wholemeal? \nSpinach with less nitrates? Organic produce is rare ly found in supermarkets. But this is \nchanging. Organic products are the next big thing. And prices will fall. A new EC regulation is \nfacilitating this development.\u201d  The article goes on to state that \u201cGerd H\u00e4rig from the Federal \nAssociation of Food Trade also agrees that: \u2018Since the fitness and health wave has embraced \nthe German consumer, organic products are increasin gly in demand\u2019\u201d . This represents yet \nanother public acknowledgement that German consumer s are becoming more health-\nconscious. Thanks to a new European law \u2013the enforc ement of which is planned for January \n1st  1993 (with planned rules for the subsequent year)\u2013  that protects and defines organic \nproduction for cereals, fruit and vegetables, a uni fied control system is being put into place, \neven though there is still no unified eco-labelling  system. This system replaces an affiliation \nwith extant organic associations or more doubtful o rganisations and opens up the market for \nmany more organic farmers \u2013foretelling a significan t drop in the price of organic produce. \nThe article emphasises that the future of organic p roduce lies in its being integrated into the \noffer of supermarkets: \n \nAs is the case at Tengelmann\u2019s for example. For the  past few months, the supermarket chain \nhas been offering almost exclusively organic produc ts from growers\u2019 associations under their \nown \u201cNaturkind\u201d [Nature\u2019s child] brand. With a lot of success [\u2026] Until recently the  crux had \nalways been that, compared to other types of food, organic products were too expensive. \nBut now they are getting cheaper since competition is invigorating the trade. [\u2026] \nTengelmann offers the first proof. Organic butter c an already be obtained there for 2.98 \nGerman Marks. In any other health food shop, one pa ys between four and five Marks, \nsometimes even more.    \n                                                 \n823  CMA ad for integrated production ( stern , Heft 48, 1992): \u201e Gepr\u00fcft: und f\u00fcr gut befunden\u201c;  \u201eAus Integriertem \nAnbau\u201c; \u201evorrangige Anwendung biologischer und mech anischer Verfahren beim Pflanzeschutz, Beachtung vo n \nSchadswellen und damit ein deutlich geringer Einsat z chemischer mittel. Also: weniger Umweltbelastung bei \nhervorragender Fruchtqualit\u00e4t.\u201c  \n824  CMA ad for animal husbandry ( Brigitte , Heft 22, 1992): \u201e Mahlzeit aus echtem Schrot & Korn\u201d; \u201eFrisch \ngeschroteter Weizen, Gerste und Hafer, Raps oder So jaschrot, Molke direkt aus der Molkerei, dazu Vitam ine und \neine extra Portion Mineralstoffe\u201c.  198 \n \n \nThe article closes with a reminder why organic prod uce will always remain a bit more \nexpensive because it reflects the real environmenta l and social costs of agriculture. 825  \n\u201cHealthy food from the canteen\u201d , a small appended article reports about an experim ent to \noffer organic food in various canteens \u2013amongst the m AEG\u2013 apparently with some success \nsince: \u201cThe organic meal is popular at AEG: according to t he workers\u2019 council, the number of \ncanteen guests has doubled among the 800 employees.  On average, between 20 and 30 \npercent of guests choose the organic meal, even tho ugh they have to pay between 20 and 80 \npercent more, depending on the quantity of meat.\u201d 826  The third Brigitte article describes a \nsimilar if more tentative development in the field of organic wine, which is attracting \ngrowing numbers of consumers and is poised to be ex perimentally introduced in \nsupermarkets in the course of that year. 827   \n \nNevertheless, ambivalence about food seems to endur e: an article in stern  denounces the \nexcess fat to be found in hospital fare, on the bas is of a study conducted by a certain Prof. \nPeter Schauder. It reminds the reader that excess f at is a trigger of many civilization diseases \nand that almost all physicians agree that an approp riate diet is the most effective and \ncheapest type of prevention. However, since nutriti onal medicine is not a compulsive subject \nin the medical curriculum, many physicians lack the  necessary knowledge. Furthermore, \nconsiderations of cost drive many hospital administ rations to stick to a traditional fatty offer, \ndespite the wishes of many patients for fresh fruit , salads and vegetables. Nevertheless, the \narticle concludes that the medical association of N iedersachsen, alerted by the results of \nProf. Schauder, will test the food of all the hospi tals in the state. 828  In stark contrast, another \nfood specialist, Prof. Volker Pudel, the president of the German Nutrition Society, takes a \nstand for fast food: \n \nThe nutrition specialist wrote the following in the  corporate brochure of a well-known fast \nfood restaurant: \u201cFast-food restaurants \u2026 offer app etizing fare and when one combines the \nmenu items correctly they also provide sufficient n utrients.\u201d So should one order salad with \n                                                 \n825  Baumgarten, Silke, \u201eEcht Biologisches erobert den Supermarkt\u201c ( Brigitte , Heft 25, 1992, pp.110-114): \u201eBrot \naus richtigem Schrot?

Food safety \nhas become a major theme that covers aspects as dif ferent as British beef imports in \nGermany, 830  chicken of doubtful provenance and breeding, 831  the success of organic fast-\nfood, 832 , German reluctance towards radiation for food pres ervation, 833  or gene food \nlabelling. 834  Two other interesting features show the evolution of health consciousness in \nGermany: on the one hand, according to the German B utchers Association, the consumption \nof meat in Germany has almost continuously dropped from 1988 onwards (from 69.4 kilos \nper capita in 1988 to 62.6 kilos in 1994) but on th e other hand, together with Denmark and \nNorway, Germany is in the champions\u2019 league of swee ts consumption. 835  \n \nLate 1990s: Healthy pleasures for wellness \nCooking during the last years of the second millenn ium seems to have come of age in terms \nof the balance between local and global, seasonal a nd luxurious, health and pleasure, fast \nand slow food. Everyday recipes epitomise this blen d by suggesting dishes such as \u201cribbon \nnoodles with fried oyster mushrooms\u201d , \u201cstuffed radicchio leaves\u201d , \u201cbraised rabbit legs\u201d , \n\u201cbread pudding with apricots\u201d or\u201d turkey schnitzel with rhubarb stew\u201d , \u201cvegetables au \ngratin\u201d and  \u201cspaghetti with cheese sauce\u201d .836  Cooking with seasonal produce \u2013such as apples \nor tomatoes\u2013 draws on a wide range of recipes from traditional to Italian (e.g. \u201cred \nrisotto\u201d ), 837  French inspired \u201cNouvelle Cuisine\u201d or more frankly  exotic.

Recipes for the latter span a broad range, from healthy \nclassics to exotic, often crossover temptations (e. g. fibre-rich muesli, muffins, milk shakes \nand smoothies, Parma ham, goat cheese, mango cottag e cheese, etc.).   \n \nFar-Eastern cooking is increasingly taken for grant ed as demonstrated by a Focus  article on \nthe extraordinary sushi-boom in Germany: \u201cIn the last five years the number of Japanese \neateries in Germany has tripled. Today around 200 J apanese restaurants can be found \nbetween the Elbe and the Isar.\u201d  But the trend is also consolidating in consumers\u2019 homes:  \n \nWhile five years ago Gruber just about sold 10 kg t o mavericks or trendsetters, now about 60 \nto 80 kgs per week are sold over the counter. Sushi  recipes books and cookery classes are \nextremely popular amongst a young, diet-conscious g eneration. Connoisseurs find related \ningredients such as sake, Sapporo beer and rice vin egar in a large number of Asian \nsupermarkets all over Germany. 838   \n \nThe same can be said of the Chinese, Indonesian, Th ai and Indian trends. However, more \nlocal or European cuisines and trends are being red iscovered or highlighted in articles such \nas \u201cViennese cooking: wonderful!\u201d  or \u201cMallorca\u2019s delicious cooking\u201d , reflecting the mobility \ntrends of the new generation that not only longs fo r the occasional long distance trip to \nfaraway lands but also requires cheap weekends in V ienna or a last-minute week in the sun \non a Mediterranean island. 839  \n \nBesides the pleasure orientation, the health theme is also very present \u2013sometimes \ndiscreetly, at other times much more forcefully. Fo r instance, many recipes not only display \ncalorie counts and nutrient tables but also star lo w(er)-fat ingredients \u2013especially in terms of \ndairy products or sugar alternatives. Fitness foods , such as salads or fruit juice cocktails, are \nthe object of an elaborate health rhetoric. An arti cle entitled \u201cFitness salads: the power-\nmeal\u201d  lists what it takes to transform a salad into a he althy meal, stressing the need for lean \nmeat, eggs or fish, as useful protein; rice, potato es or noodles for the necessary \ncarbohydrates and fibres; lettuce and vegetables fo r vitamins and minerals that strengthen \nimmune reaction, protect from infections, smooth th e skin and detoxify; and finally, high-\nquality oils for essential fatty acids as well as h erbs and spices that stimulate the \nmetabolism. 840  Another article, \u201cFast beauty and fitness with juices\u201d , praises the virtues of \njuicing ( \u201cIt\u2019s pure health, helps fight stress and performan ce lows, is good against colds and \neven prevents cancer, as the newest studies have sh own.\u201d)  while also reminding readers that \n                                                 \n838  \u201eSushi \u2013 die Bratwurst Japans\u201c [\u201e Vom Nobel-Food f\u00fcr Kosmopoliten zum Snack f\u00fcr jeder mann \u2013 die Zahl der \nSushi-Bars und \u2013Lieferdienste in Deutschland steigt  an. \u201c], ( Focus , Heft 22, 26.05.1997, pp. 180-182): \u201e In den \nletzten f\u00fcnf Jahren hat sich die Zahl der japanisch en E\u00dfst\u00e4tten in Deutschland verdreifacht.

A 1997 campa ign shows groups of products according \nto nutrients (protein: cheeses and milk; carbohydra tes: bread, fruit, milk; fats: cream, yogurt \nor butter) alongside pictures of sporty individuals  (e.g. a woman sporting inline skates and \nplaying hockey or a windsurfer). 842  A subsequent ad portrays a cheese assortment with the \nfollowing text on the first page : \u201cA varied cheese assortment contains a lot of pro tein, \ncalcium and B-vitamins. The dark mixed rye bread an d delicious rolls provides carbohydrates \nand sufficient fibre. Butter and especially milk su pply easy-to-digest milk fat, liposoluble \nvitamins, protein and that essential calcium.\u201d  And on the second page, under a photograph \nof a couple cycling in the (presumably German) coun tryside, readers are reminded that a \nbalanced diet with German produce provides all the necessary nutrients for fitness and \nhealth. 843  Besides more practical nutritional and cooking inf ormation, a dissemination \ncampaign for olive oil mysteriously states that \u201cOlive oil has a soul\u201d  before adding that \u201cOne \ncan believe the myths surrounding the olive-tree. O r one can just taste it.\u201d  844   \n \nEven convenience food seems to bear the constraints  of a healthy appearance. Thus, iglo \u2019s \nfish fingers are apparently manufactured with only the finest filets: \u201cSo that you get all the \nvitamins and minerals that fish can offer\u201d . Even more explicit is the firm\u2019s ads for frozen \nvegetables emphasising a so-called \u201cvitamin-seal\u201d . A pack of e.g. frozen spinach is held by a \npair of androgynous hands alongside the statement \u201cHere are the vitamins\u201d  and the text \ngoes on to explain that the spinach is frozen as so on as it is harvested to avoid vitamin \nloss. 845  More surprisingly perhaps, sausage becomes \u201cfit\u201d w ith the addition of e.g. full milk \nand even functional ( \u201cwith precious fibre\u201d) , as in Club Vital \u2019s full milk mortadella \u2013thus \ninvolving less fat, hence also fewer calories. 846   \n \nThis means that more questionably healthy foods hav e to play along the lines of either \nhumour (witness a campaign for sugar starring a fru strated-looking old dame with rollers \nalongside the following statement: \u201cAfter 3 weeks without dessert, her life felt somew hat \ntasteless.

Both scientists advocate fast food \u2013especial ly hamburgers\u2013 as snacks in-between \nmeals (!) especially if they are combined with a sa lad, a glass of milk or juice. A subsequent \narticle featuring a comparison between traditional fast-foods condemns \u201cCurry-Wurst\u201d [a \npopular sausage speciality served with curried ketc hup] because it allegedly contains almost \ntwice the fat of tacos or hamburgers. 851   \n \nIn the wake of cholesterol-conscious fats such as becel , functional food really begins to boom \nin 1996, especially in the realm of milk products ( e.g. Nestl\u00e9 \u2019s LC1 , S\u00fcdmilch \u2019s Vifit  or \nDanone \u2019s Actimel ). Discourse on functional milk products that have been enhanced with \nvarious bacteria, repeatedly emphasises effects on intestinal flora, hence the metabolism \nand general immunity. But while both big producers emphasise the naturalness of their \nproducts, they use different strategies. Danone  stresses only natural origins when describing \nthe yogurt as a \u201cWellness-Drink\u201d  (another pioneering \u201cwellness\u201d label!) and the L.C asei \nbacteria it contains as a \u201cculture that is particularly health-enhancing and that comes from \nnature\u201d since  \u201cIt is found in small quantities in e.g. fresh, un processed milk and kefir\u201d. 852  And \nNestl\u00e9,  while still extolling a natural origin, is more pr agmatic in its approach: \u201cIt was \ndeveloped by nature and selected exclusively for Ne stl\u00e9\u2019s LC1 by nutritionists at the Nestl\u00e9 \nResearch Centre in Lausanne.\u201d  And after vulgarising the effects of the bacteria in the body in \nthree steps, the text states: \u201cIn order to obtain and prove this result, research ers and \nnutritionists in Switzerland and in France have res earched for four years and conducted \nnumerous experiments.\u201d  Thus, scientific expertise seems to hold the upper  hand over nature \nhere. Nevertheless, the ad reassures the reader tha t \u201cHealth can also taste good\u201d  since the \nyogurt is available in two \u201cdelicious\u201d  varieties. 853  \n \nA major functional food theme is risk, hence the ne ed for security and protection: becel , for \nexample, shows a businessman holding on to the rope s of an open parachute above the \ncaption \u201cThink of your security: lead a cholesterol-conscio us life with becel\u201d .854  A small article \nin Focus  announces the U.S. launching of a line of products  \u2013pasta, crisps and biscuits\u2013 made \nwith psyllium, a plant from the plantain family ren owned for its mucilaginous properties, \ncombined with a low-fat diet, is supposed to dimini sh the cholesterol level.

A few centners of these pl us salt and water transform excess fruit \njuice into an isotonic ACE-fitness drink. It is bel ief that is decisive here. Even traditional \nfoods/drinks owe their popularity to the legends su rrounding them. For instance, the one \nclaiming that mineral water provides potassium. How ever, to obtain the recommended daily \namount just with water, one would have to drink mor e than 2,200 litres. \n \nThe point \u2013as the article sees it\u2013 is that producer s are just as anxious to avoid their products \nbeing tested as drugs (a long, costly and uncertain  process) as they are to make the \nconsumer believe in the health effects of their pro ducts. 856  Similarly, an article in Brigitte \ndenounces the inappropriate nutritional contents of  many \u201cenergy-bars\u201d, which are often \nmuch too fatty or are too expensive for average con sumers who cannot justify a heightened \nintake of carbohydrates and protein by their sporti ng exploits alone. Were it not for \npreservation and practical considerations, a banana  would do just as well and would be \ncheaper claims an expert from the German Nutrition Society .857   \n \nNevertheless, ads for functional food continue to e xploit consumers\u2019 fascination for extreme \nsports and performance \u2013interestingly also across t he gender divide as illustrated by an ad \nfor Aquarius , an isotonic sports drink produced by Coca-Cola . The visual layout is relatively \nunusual: a sweaty woman\u2019s face in profile looking d ownwards occupies the upper third of \nthe ad. Her hand reaches out from the lower half ho lding a bottle of Aquarius towards her \nmouth. A  seemingly hand-written caption occupies the left ha nd side and states : \u201cAfter a \nkick-boxing round with the gentlemen from the manag ement floor, it was time to freshen up \na little\u201d . On the bottom part, in buzzword fashion, one can read: \u201c8 vitamins \u2013 4 minerals \u2013 \nstrong citrus taste \u2013 Aquarius. Because life is a t ough game\u201d . Thus the surprising twist in this \ncase, is that the practice of a martial art, involv ing discipline, endurance and even aggression \nis explicitly connected with the world of work and corporate performance, but from an \nunusual feminine perspective, since women\u2019s inclusi on in either realm is still far from being \nself-evident in Germany. 858   \n                                                 \n855  \u201eNudeln, Chips und Kekse auf Rezept\u201c ( Focus , Heft 3, 18.01.1999).  \n856   Heilsbotschaft aus dem Labor ( stern , Heft 35, 26.08.1999): \u201e Vitamine sind zwar Massenware aus chemischer \nProduktion.

I have already quoted and \nanalysed the 1985 ad for taxofit Vitamin E (Bunte, Heft 16, 1985) in the introductio n to Chapter 4 ( History ). This \nad also echoes the ad for Staatl. Fachingen Heilwas ser ( prima , Heft 6, 1986) that I have analysed earlier on in \nthis chapter. 204 \n \n \nIn terms of health foods, brands such as Schneekoppe  still mostly play on the nurturing \nclich\u00e9, encouraging mothers or future mothers to th ink of their responsibility in providing \nadequate, healthy and natural nutrition for the nex t generation. For instance, an ad for \nSchneekoppe portrays a blissful young woman lying i n tall grass with the following caption: \n\u201cPregnant! Me! Unbelievable. Unbelievably wonderful . Suddenly, one sees the world in a \ncompletely different light. One thinks of things su ch as naturalness and origin. And whether \nthe little one would actually prefer carrot or sea buckthorn juice.\u201d 859 Also, organic products \nare increasingly aggressively pushed in ads for e.g . \u201c\u00d6ko-Logisch  [eco-logical] F\u00fcllhorn\u201d , a \nbrand to be found in Rewe supermarkets until 2008. 860  The two-page campaigns of 1998 and \n1999 all display bucolic scenes from an idealised G erman countryside with happy animals \nproducing milk, yogurt, ice-cream or eggs or, alter nately, the useful animals contributing to a \nhealthy ecosystem for organic potatoes, onions, etc . All the ads display extremely detailed \ntexts vulgarising the practices of organic agricult ure. Before suggesting the advantages of \norganic breeding, one of the ads also typically pla ys on the security concerns of consumers in \nthe aftermath of food scandals: \u201cThe risks and side-effects entailed in mass-breedi ng and the \nuse of meat and bone meal, not to mention so-called  \u2018performance-enhancers\u2019 have long \nbeen known. Nevertheless, there are repeated scanda ls linked to e.g. BSE or dioxin-laced \nfoods.\u201d 861  In contrast, a long article in Focus details the controversy reigning in Brussels \nabout gene-food labelling and its echoes in Germany , emphasising that the complexity of \nstakes means that most decisions for or against gen e food are instinctive rather than \nscientifically-based. However, it stresses that cho ice, hence labelling, is crucial for well over \nhalf of German consumers. 862  \n \nIn the drinks sphere, \u201cSchonkaffee\u201d [mild coffee] o r light coffee is being revived with pictures \nof a sexy young woman either lounging in comfy clot hes at home ( \u201cAnother one of these \ntypical coffee-drinking biddies\u201d ) or sitting at a restaurant table and groomed like  a city-smart \nbeauty in a short dress and sandals ( \u201cYour typical coffee-drinking biddy: it\u2019s always ti me for \nKr\u00f6nung light\u201d ). Both ads are for Jacobs \u2019 blend \u2013with half the caffeine but the full aroma.  \nInterestingly, the expression \u201ccoffee-drinking bidd y\u201d [Kaffeetante], is ironically-positively \ninvested here. A later ad shows a close-up of a cup  of coffee with a yin-yang sign made out \nof the foam on the surface. The caption reads \u201cDiscover the balance between mildness and a \npampering aroma!\u201d  and an announcement at the bottom of the ad mentio ns 10 wellness \nweekends in a spa town to be won by asking for a sa mple of the coffee. 863  An ad for Tchibo \nSana  plays more on the sensitive note by portraying the  face of a young freckled beauty and, \npresumably, the same young woman dancing in a field  against a wooded background, \n                                                 \n859  E.g. ad for Schneekoppe products ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 17, 1999): \u201eSchwanger!

Its bounties seem to know no limits thank s to vitamins and \nantioxidants that combat free radicals and various types of cancer. 865   \n \nNevertheless, echoing a 1990 development I have alr eady discussed, the beverage whose \ncareer seems most promising is water. Indeed, an ar ticle in Focus entitled \u201cMineral Water\u201d  \nunder the \u201cFocal Point\u201d  [Brennpunkt] rubric describes mineral water as THE  beverage of the \nnineties. Apart from a typology of waters, a hit-pa rade of German brands, explanations on \nthe effects of minerals as well as the average cons umption of mineral water in various \nEuropean countries, a table showing the progression  of water consumption in the old west \nGerman states and, from 1990, in the newly-formed G erman states shows a steady \nprogression, but with an extremely steep rise in co nsumption between 1985 and 1990 (cf. \n1970: 12.5, 1975: 24.8, 1980: 39.6, 1985: 57.0, 199 0: 82.7, 1991: 89.3, 1992: 94.7, etc. in \nnumbers of litres per capita). The rationale given for this development is the following: \u201cThe \nwater boom is not only fuelled by the increased bod y- and health-consciousness of the \n\u2018wellness\u2019 generation but also by the environmental  consciousness of a society eager to avoid \nrubbish.\u201d  The reference to a \u201cwellness generation\u201d  is particularly significant, since it \nrepresents the first allusion to wellness as a very  influential ideology in an article on food or \ndrink. Here, it is clearly associated with an incre ased holistic consciousness. The text then \ngoes on to describe how a vast system of returnable  bottles has been built up over the last \n25 years and emphasises another ecological argument , namely that most mineral waters \nhave local distribution networks, implying that bot tles rarely travel more than 100 \nkilometres away from the source. 866   \n \nNaturalness is also stressed in a number of water a ds.  867  However, concerns are also raised \nby tests performed on bottled mineral waters. Accor ding to a stern  article, 50 out of 73 \nsamples contained chemicals and germs.

Thanks to the vitamins, trace elements and hormones they contain, \nchocolate but also bananas, chillies, seafood, oat flakes and chick peas are viewed as real \nhappiness boosters. 871  Finally, a seasonal article on chocolate seems to further confirm the \npositive reputation of the formerly disparaged choc olate by listing its various health-inducing \nsubstances: polyhydroxyphenols (good for the heart) , caffeine and theobromine (good for \nalertness and concentration), B-complex vitamins (g ood for digestion and nerves) and \nphenethylamine (said to contribute to the release o f dopamine for a sunny disposition). The \narticle also debunks the myths whereby chocolate is  fattening, blocks digestion, triggers \n                                                 \n869  Ad for Die Deutschen Wasserwerke tap water ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 9, 1996): \u201cNull Kalorien \u2013 Null \nGeschmacksverst\u00e4rker \u2013 Null Farbstoff\u201d; \u201eAuf unser Leitungswasser sind wir m\u00e4chtig stolz.

S/he understands how to live \nhealthily without forgoing pleasure. Good food and drink are increasingly a part of lifestyle. \nPleasure belongs to life \u2013 and people are prepared to pay for it\u201d . 873  \n \nTaking stock \nSumming up this sweeping overview of the German foo d realm over two decades is no easy \ntask but there are a number of significant overall trends that should be highlighted. First of \nall, the offer (and seemingly also the consumption)  of food and drinks in Germany becomes \nextremely cosmopolitan within those two decades. Th e rather local and traditional diet of \nthe early 1980s gradually gives way to a few exotic  touches (such as e.g. paprika, pineapple \nor olives), before being increasingly seduced by th e food habits of neighbouring or close \nEuropean countries (especially Italy and France) an d finally swept off its feet by Middle \nEastern, Indian or Japanese cooking. This geographi cal expansiveness is matched by the \nincreasing variety of preparation and cooking metho ds: from the popularity of buffet-style \nmeals to decrease hostess hassle, to the novelty (o r rather revival?) of all-in-one dishes \n(from French gratin to Indonesian bami goreng or cl assical German \u201cEintopf\u201d), to steaming \nfish or vegetables to save on fat or using a wok pa n to preserve vitamins through stir frying, \nnot to mention the presentation aesthetics of Asian  culinary traditions or the French \n\u201cNouvelle Cuisine\u201d. \n \nSecondly, convenience foods seem to meet with a res ounding success despite initially \napologetic intrusions into everyday cooking. Indeed , whereas excuses still seemed to be \nrequired to use frozen fish, tinned soup or chocola te pudding powder in the early 1980s, in \nthe 1990s convenience food is self-confidently asso ciated with time-saving, fun and pleasure \nwhile spanning all courses, from the appetizer to t he dessert. Moreover, it enrols the use of \nnew packaging technologies (such as supple mixed pl astic, paper or metal packs), confirms \nthe centrality of established domestic technologies  such as the fridge and the freezer while \ntremendously contributing to the success of newer t echnologies such as the pressure cooker \nor the microwave.  \n \nIn contrast, the third remarkable trend is the incr easing popularity of whole foods, mainly \nfrom local integrated or organic production, as a r eaction against pesticide-intensive \nfarming, industrial manufacturing and various envir onmental disasters. This return to \n\u201cnature\u201d also triggers an incipient crusade against  additives and industrial processes that \nadulterate natural taste or foster health risks: fr om artificial flavours, to flavour enhancers \nand preservatives, through irradiation and genetic modification, not to mention growth \nhormones and antibiotics in animal husbandry. Begin ning with cereals, fruits and vegetables, \nthe offer grows to include a number of foodstuffs. However, the tension between the desire \nfor affordable but pristine natural products and th e fear related to the modern necessity of \nlarge-scale and cheap production remains unresolved . This is reflected in the wish to \nessentialise nature by anchoring it to a bygone idy ll, usually unmarred by the blue diesel \nsmoke of tractors, the stench of contemporary poult ry rearing or the cacophony involved in \nthe industrial production of breakfast cereals.  \n                                                 \n872  Metzger, Dagmar, \u201eSchokolade: Die verlockend gesun de Versuchung\u201c ( Focus , Heft 49, 06.12.1999).  \n873   Haas, Sibylle, Jahrbuch der Werbung in Deutschland, \u00d6sterreich und  der Schweiz , D\u00fcsseldorf & Wien: ECON,  \n1990, p. 128. 208 \n \n \nThis attitude is also reflected in an emerging cook ing trend, that of the so-called \u201cslow-food\u201d \nmovement \u2013even if this trend is not yet named in th e sources I have been able to access. \nHere the emphasis is on accessing \u201cauthentic\u201d and u sually seasonal products stemming from \nsmall-scale local producers or producers from nearb y European countries renowned for their \nfood traditions, such as Italy, France or Spain and  cooking them slowly and traditionally. \nConvenience almost represents a bad word in this co oking philosophy since aficionados will \nspare no efforts in peeling, chopping, preserving, broiling, roasting, etc. in order to respect \nand enhance the quality of the produce. 874   \n \nBut when science or technology does legitimately in trude, it is to lend an aura of \nseriousness, credibility and security to products t hat are designed to limit the risks inherent \nin a disenchantedly technicised nature \u2013rife with C hernobyls, Bhopals, mad cows, nitrates, \ncholesterol, fatigue, low immunity and difficult di gestion. These preoccupations are reflected \nin the fourth trend, i.e. the increasing functional  food offer. 875  Initially very timid in the early \n1980s, it gradually embraces many domains: from jui ces to shakes, isotonic drinks, milk \nproducts, fats and a vast of array of cereal-based sport snacks, heralding the ubiquitousness \nand sophistication of our contemporary functional o fferings (such as e.g. omega-3 bread or \naloe vera yogurt).   \n \nLast but not least, the so-called \u201clight\u201d or \u201cdiet\u201d  wave represents a central trend, the career \nof which seems unfalteringly popular throughout the  two decades examined. It represents \nthe main strategy to actively counter or passively contain weight gain and it rests on two, \noften co-dependent pillars, i.e. sugar and fat redu ction or substitution. 876  The success of the \nfirst pillar is strikingly illustrated by artificia l sweeteners, which were initially promoted to \nenhance hot drinks before finding their way into ju st about any non-savoury product: from \njam, to sodas, vanilla pudding, yogurt, cereals, ch ocolate and chewing-gum. The second \npillar is especially emblematised by low-fat milk p roducts, lunch meats and margarine.  \n \n                                                 \n874  The slow food movement has no doubted been spurred  on by a rediscovery and expansion of the French \n\u201cfood authenticity\u201d concept, the so-called \u201cAppellation d\u2019Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e\u201d  [AOC ] that translates into the \nEnglish \u201cControlled Designation of Origin\u201d , the Italian \u201cDenominazione di Origine Controllata\u201d , the Spanish \n\u201cDenominaci\u00f3n de Origen\u201d  or the Portuguese \u201cDenomina\u00e7\u00e3o de Origem Controlada\u201d , etc. For more information \non the history and philosophy behind these labels c f. e.g. the website of the French \u201cInstitut Nationa l de \nl\u2019Origine et de la Qualit\u00e9\u201d: http://www.inao.gouv.fr/  or a European website: \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/schemes/ind ex_en.htm .  [websites accessed Aug. 2011] \n875  Functional food can be defined as industrially man ufactured products containing natural or artificial  \nadditives. The latter are meant to supplement or en hance the nutritional value of food with the aim of  \nreinforcing or modifying bodily functions, such as the digestive, coronary or immune systems. \n876  However as Carolyn de la Pe\u00f1a soberly concludes in  her analysis of the trajectory of sweeteners in th e U.S.: \n\u201cIf we want to understand how we could, as a societ y, simultaneously support a massive increase in low -calorie \nfood and beverage sales and a relentlessly rising \u2018 average\u2019 American weight over the last sixty years,  we need to \nlook more closely at what low-calorie foods have ac tually been designed to do. History reveals that th e answer \nis sell products not create thin people.\u201d And further discussing the paradoxical link between  artificial \nsweeteners, body ideals and American-style consumpt ion: \u201c[...] we can overstuff our couches and our houses \nand our cars but we are not permitted to overstuff ourselves. Artificial sweeteners allow us to try to  have it both \nways.  We can hyperconsume while \u201cworking\u201d to be th in. We put more into our bodies in order to end up with \nless body overall. And so one of the paradoxes cent ral to contemporary capitalism is resolved: unfette red \nconsumption can lead to fiscal \u2013 and physical \u2013 hea lth. Or not.\u201d Cf.  De la Pe\u00f1a, Carolyn Th., Empty Pleasures: the \nstory of artificial sweeteners from Saccharin to Sp lenda , op. cit., pp. 11-12.  209 \n \nThese seemingly contradictory trends are but a refl ection of the liminal status of food \nbetween biological/physiological and cultural/socia l imperatives, as aptly summed up by \nKarin Zachmann when analysing the boom in food stud ies and its repercussions for the \nhistory of technology: \n \nThe challenge of the food theme lies in the borderl ine position of the field. Food reproduces \nthe body as a biological organism and (re-)constitu tes the individual as a social subject. In \nnutrition and food studies, modern thought patterns  pertaining to the dichotomisation of \nnature and culture become obsolete. Furthermore, in  this domain, strict categorisations \nbetween town and countryside, industry and agricult ure, production and consumption or \ndivisions between organic and mechanical as well as  grown and made should not be \nunderstood as polarities but rather as complementar y relationships. 877  \n \nOn a more general discursive level, the growing pop ularity of exotic, convenience, natural, \nfunctional and low-cal foods appeals to a wide rang e of desirable consumer behaviours \nwhich in turn are fleetingly alluded to, spelt out or emphasised again and again to the point \nof brainwashing. These attitudes are as varied as o pen-mindedness, a sense of adventure, a \nlove of fun and pleasure as well as discipline, res traint, rationality, health- or more generally \nrisk-consciousness. The latter qualities are especi ally extolled in the discourse around \nslimming that plays on some of the most \u201cnormative\u201d  fears in our society. Jakob Tanner \nperceives that the fear of overweight is grounded i n a contemporary ethics of prevention \nthat betrays \u201ca growing preoccupation with health and a fundamen tal postulate whereby \nboth society and individual are perfectible\u201d . He ascribes this shift to a change in the meaning  \nof food dating back to the interwar years: \u201cFrom a universal dietetics, food has become \u2018a \nmeans to perfect the self\u2019 in the process of its te chnologisation. Prevention thus increasingly \nbecomes a duty of self-rationalisation, which is de rived from an economic postulate and \napplied to the body.\u201d 878  The next case study will examine whether this ethi cs also applies to \ncosmetics. \n \n                                                 \n877  Cf.

Indeed, it seems that health rat ionality just makes way for a more \nspontaneous and emotional relationship with the ski n. Besides an initial emphasis on youth, \nthe first ad (for Placentubex face cream ) emphasises the hectic rhythm of everyday life that \nmodern women can master through a consciously organ ised but taken for granted holistic \napproach. In contrast, the second ad for Happyderm  focuses not on strategy and rationality \nbut on the positive emotion literally incorporated in healthy-looking skin. 882  The skin is \npersonalised and the proactive agency of consumers is not even mentioned here. Implicitly, \nsimply applying Happyderm  will make the skin happy. However, just as in the food realm, \nwhen surveying the cosmetic discourse over two deca des, it becomes obvious that rational \n(i.e. technoscientific or just \u201ccommonsensical\u201d) co smetic discourse co-exists with a more \nnature-oriented and emotional rhetoric. In fact, in  the early 1980s, natural products and \narguments already abound, so it is the rhetorical n egotiation of nature, emotion, rationality \nand high tech that becomes really interesting in th e course of the following decades. \n \n                                                 \n879  From the outset, I should emphasise that I have ma inly focused on what I would call \u201cnon-decorative\u201d,  \nmainly facial cosmetics, i.e. leaving out make-up, hair- and nailcare as well as depilation products. I have also \nleft out men\u2019s cosmetics to a large extent since fa ce creams for men were blatantly underrepresented i f not \ntotally absent during the period under consideratio n.  \n880  Ad for Placentubex Kosmetik ( Freundin , Heft 5, 1980): \u201e Frauen von heute bleiben l\u00e4nger jung, weil sie mehr  \nf\u00fcr sich tun.

In the  case of cosmetics, there has long been an \nabundance of (pseudo-)historical studies on groomin g \u2013especially as it pertains to hygienic \nand decorative practices. The mainstay of this prod uction can be described as so-called \n\u201ccoffee-table\u201d offerings spanning broad periods \u2013i. e. often beginning with either Egyptian or \nClassical Antiquity, the Renaissance/Baroque or the  19 th  century. They generally boast \nglamorous illustrations, dubious cultural interpret ations of particular beauty rituals and \nshocking revelations about the \u201cappalling\u201d personal  habits typical of bygone eras or the \nhealth hazards inherent to various products and tec hniques. A few studies such as e.g. Kathy \nPeiss\u2019s Hope in a Jar  or Geoffrey Jones\u2019s Beauty Imagined  provide good market development \nanalyses as well as short corporate histories of th e most influential companies and \nindividuals but rather little on late modern discur sive strategies centred on appropriate \nskincare.883  So, here again, my primary interest lies in analys ing the historically cyclical focus \non \u201cnatural\u201d versus \u201cartificial-technological\u201d aspe cts of cosmetics as well as their growing \ninterpenetration and interdependence. \n \nNature\u2019s best? \nGenerally, apart from a few exceptional all-in-one creams, skincare in those years already \nrepresents a complex venture. Most producers advert ise entire lines of interdependent \nproducts. These correspond to \u201cindispensable\u201d steps  in appropriate face-care: cleansing \nrequires cleansing milk, toning a skin toner, moist urising a moisturising cream, rejuvenating \nan anti-wrinkle cream or serum used on a daily basi s. Occasionally, it is deemed necessary to \nexfoliate with a face scrub or a peeling cream, and  regenerate with a face mask. Should the \nskin appear in need of more in-depth repair, a temp orary intensive treatment with ampoules \nis often recommended. The programmatic nature of la te modern skin care not only serves \nthe purpose of increasing the sales of indispensabl e products, it additionally reinforces the \n\u201ctechnoscientific\u201d rationality of body-care and bac ks a strict organisation of everyday life.  \n \nNevertheless, from the onset of the 1980s, \u201cnature\u201d  is writ large in many cosmetics \nadvertisements. At this point, however, it should b e stressed that, to this day, there is no \nstate-regulated certification for natural cosmetics  in Germany. 884  Concretely, this means that \nany producer can label its cosmetics as \u201cnatural\u201d. However, in parallel with the increasing \npopularity of organic foods, conscious consumers\u2019 i nterest in \u201cgenuinely natural\u201d cosmetics \nhas fostered the emergence of a number of more or l ess binding certification labels. Just as \nin organic food certification, Demeter , the biodynamic agriculture association closely \naffiliated with anthroposophy, was a pioneer in thi s field in the 1990s. 885  But due to its \n                                                 \n883  Cf.

Moreover, contrary to the the food sph ere \u2013as far as I am aware, there seems to be no rec urring \nlarge-scale scientific (and publically-funded) stud ies on the actual consumption of cosmetics in Germa ny. \n884  Cf. http://www.ikw.org/pdf/broschueren/06.pdf   from the website of the German Cosmetic, Toiletry , \nPerfumery and Detergent Association: http://www.ikw.org/pages/main_about_us.php .

A label with more popular appeal is \nthe so-called BDIH  certification, introduced in 2001 and developed to gether with a number \nof well-known natural cosmetics companies. 887  Competing labels include e.g. the originally \nFrench label ECOCERT 888  or  the relatively new label  NaTrue  (founded in 2008), 889  as well as \nthe much less demanding European Ecolabel  for soaps, shampoos and conditioners, 890  the \npopularity of which still appears very limited. 891  With varying degrees of stringency, natural \ncosmetics certification labels usually endorse the use of natural (often organic) vegetable \noils and fats, beeswax and milk derivatives, plant extracts or essential oils, etc. while usually \nlimiting or banning mineral oils, silicon and its d erivatives, a number of artificial additives \nand preservatives, animal testing, genetic engineer ing and irradiation.  \n \nThus, the \u201cnaturalness\u201d of cosmetics in the two dec ades under consideration should not be \ntaken strictly at face value. Within the \u201cnatural\u201d sphere, a differentiated range of products \nshould be distinguished: those that just highlight one or two natural extracts or ingredients \nand those that are explicitly designed and designat ed as \u201cNaturkosmetik\u201d  or \u201ckontrollierte \nNaturkosmetik\u201d  and guarantee natural ingredients or processes, as  well as renounce or limit \nthe use of a number of main ingredients or additive s (e.g. colourings, fragrances, artificial \nemulsifiers or other synthetic ingredients). It sho uld also be kept in mind that there are a \nnumber of smaller producers who offer genuinely nat ural cosmetics but cannot afford the \ncertification, be it financially or administrativel y. \n \n1980: Flower power versus rational care \nIn the early 1980s, a particularly interesting seri es of ads designed by the Aok firm features a \nseries of casually-dressed young women with \u201cnatura l\u201d hairstyles and make-up in bucolic \n                                                 \n886  At least 90% of ingredients in the cosmetics must be certified by the association, which \u2013until the \nemergence of the NaTrue certification with its 3 le vels\u2013 boasted much stricter rules than any other or ganic \ncertification agencies. Cf. ibid. Now, the 3rd leve l of NaTrue  certification, the so-called \u201cOrganic Cosmetics\u201d  \nlabel, must guarantee \u201cat least 95 % of natural ingredients from controll ed organic cultivation and/or controlled \nwild collection\u201d.

Each ad starts with an admonition to \nrediscover nature: \n \nBreathe in the spring wind more often. Start counti ng trees instead of kilometres. [\u2026] Try and \nexperience nature a bit more. 892    \n \nRetain a sense for natural and simple things. Enjoy  clear water and spicy air. Be an ally of \nnature. 893   \n \nTry and live a bit more naturally. Breathe again mo re freely. Don\u2019t just look at the woods on \ntelevision. Discover more nature for you and your s kin. 894  \n \nIn each ad, the deadening convenience of modern lif e is implicitly denounced: \u201ckilometres\u201d  \nno doubt stand for \u201ctransportation by car\u201d; \u201cnatural and simple things\u201d  suggest \u201cartificial \nand sophisticated products\u201d as a counterpoint, and the \u201cwoods on television\u201d  imply a society \nestranged from its habitat through increasing media  penetration. To counterbalance this \nalienation, each ad ends with the following admonit ion: \u201cBecome an Aok-woman\u201d, before \nproviding the three following reasons, respectively : \u201cAok-women experience nature very \nnaturally\u201d , \u201cAok-women are women who treasure nature\u201d  and \u201cAok-women get more out of \nnature\u201d . There again, the rather tautological formulation of the first reason hints at an \nenjoyment of nature that is not exploitative. The s econd reason suggests that consuming this \nface cream is a way to affirm one\u2019s solidarity with  nature while the third reason implies that \na positive alliance with nature will unlock its hid den bounty.  \n \nOther cosmetic brands employ a similar rhetoric whi le more explicitly describing the \ncontents and function of their products. The French  brand Clarins  for instance exhorts \nconsumers to \u201cTake nature at its word\u201d  and describes \u201cpreparations that include all the \nactive components of nature\u201d  with \u201coils that deeply penetrate into the skin and thus support \nthe natural regeneration of the epidermis\u201d .895  The Heliotrop  brand also stresses the \nimportance of in-depth effects while extolling Hygrosorb\u00ae , an active agent complex that \nresembles the so-called \u201cnatural moisturising factor\u201d .896  If both ads stress nature as an \ninspiration, they suggest that the natural componen ts have been combined or reordered to \nensure maximum efficacy.

Since the st ate of the skin is perceived as a lifestyle \nrevealer, it makes sense to not limit skincare to t he obvious  \u201ccleaning, refreshing, nurturing\u201d \nsteps mentioned in the introductory Placentubex  quote. Thus, even the discourse used to \nmarket Oil of Olaz 901 , a product not particularly renowned for its \u201cnatu ral\u201d orientation, relies \non healthy living tips such as the following: \n \nSince the skin is nourished from the inside, your b eauty programme also starts there with \ncrispy salads, fresh fruit, plenty of milk, vegetab les and wholemeal bread. They stimulate the \nmetabolism and help your body to detoxify. Regular movement \u2013such as going for a walk, \nswimming, riding a bike or whatever you feel like\u2013 activates your blood circulation and thus \nalso the circulation in the skin. Moreover, a Scott ish shower in the morning is the best \nmedicine for tired winter skin. Of course you shoul dn\u2019t forget a massage with a massage \nglove.  902  \n \n                                                 \n897  Douglas ad for Biotherm ( Brigitte , Heft 19, 1980): \u201e Nat\u00fcrliche Kosmetik ist f\u00fcr Douglas die nat\u00fcrlichst e Sache \nder Welt.[\u2026] Hier setzt auch die zeitgem\u00e4\u00dfe, naturo rientierte Kosmetik ein.

An \ninteresting example is an advertising campaign for Merz Spezial Creme  (or Lotion ) starring a \nshort-haired woman \u201cseriously\u201d jogging in an approp riate outfit (i.e. shorts, a sweatshirt and \na towel around her neck) 904 , a woman cycling 905  or two women running on the beach in \ncasual wear (one with trousers and a sleeveless T-s hirt and the other with a pair of wet \ntrousers and a macram\u00e9 bikini bra displaying a lot of glistening skin...). 906  The lyrical tone of \nthe accompanying text makes it worth quoting extens ively:   \n \nToday\u2019s prettiest women always look a bit like if t hey had just come back from a jog on the \nbeach, a tennis match or a bicycle tour. The touch of sun and wind on their faces, which \nmakes them so attractive, is the radiance and luste r of healthy fresh skin. Merz Spezial \nHauftpflege was designed for these women. It suppor ts the most natural cosmetics in the \nworld: the self-regenerating function of skin cells . Indeed healthy skin is born every day, \nmovement and energy are its essence \u2013 new fresh cel ls continuously replace the old grey \nskin. Merz does not just protect your skin as well as regulate its fatty acids and moisture \nbalance but also supports this self-regeneration, w ithout which your skin cannot live and look \ngood. [\u2026] Healthy skin is beautiful skin. 907  \n \nFirst of all, the rhetorical similarities of this a d with my initial quote, i.e. the ad for \nPlacentubex, can be explained by the fact that the latter was al so manufactured by Merz .908  \nBut compared to the Placentubex  ad, here there is no explicit emphasis on stress t hat has to \nbe countered by a holistic consciousness or practic e: women just appear effortlessly healthy \nand sporty and the cream is only represented as a p rotective or supportive agent.  \n \nMany cosmetic producers also self-consciously draw on both technical and natural registers \nby appealing to the \u201cresults of the most modern cometological research\u201d  while proning the \n                                                 \n903  Cf.

Surprisingly, there are two \nversions of the ad with the women running on the be ach: the one I have just quoted from the begining o f the \nyear and a later one [ad for Merz Spezial Lotion; Brigitte,  Heft 17, 1980]. In the first ad the macrame-braed \nwoman displays an unsightly bulge just above the wa istline of her jeans that is probably more postural  than \nadipose. The second has corrected this aesthetic \u201ca nomaly\u201d by showing what looks like the same model i n a \nsimilar outfit; however she is jogging in a more er ect manner and there is no bulge to be seen. One ca n only \nspeculate that a stricter \u201cappropriate body\u201d stylin g code has come to pass in the interval...  \n907  Ibid.: \u201e Die h\u00fcbschesten Frauen von heute sehen immer ein bi \u00dfchen so aus, als ob sie gerade von einem \nStrandlauf, einem Tennismatch oder einer Radtour ko mmen.

A later ad for Placentubex cream explicitly state s that the \nproduct has been developed over a number years by M erz scientists ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 19, 1983).

Another intriguing ad app eals to Scandinavian nature as a \nstandard without mentioning any specifically natura l ingredients. Pierre Robert  (nice Swedish \nname by the way\u2026) is supposedly the number one cosme tic supplier in Sweden and the text \nof the ad states the following:  \n \nDiscover the Swedes\u2019 beauty ideal with the new skin care range by Pierre Robert, from the \nland of pure nature with its fresh sources and clea r mountain lakes. Pierre Robert Skin Care is \nan allergy-tested range for every skintype and ever y product was designed to offer an \nabsolutely neutral pH-value. Pierre Robert Skin Car e is produced with the utmost care in the \nfirm\u2019s own laboratories under particularly strict c ontrol. 911  \n \nIn this example, the purity of Swedish nature becom es an empty signifier for the industrial \npurity of these cosmetic products since the emphasi s here is on the production process. \nMany other brands, however, are much more straightf orward in their allegiance to scientific \nresearch and product processing. A brand such as Helena Rubinstein  does not even \nforeground nature in its advertising discourse for Skin Life . The motto here is \u201cScience for \nbeauty\u201d  and sophisticated ladies are portrayed with produc ts from the range, which contains \na mysterious biological active agent named \u201cGAM\u201d . 912  On a similar note, before listing a \nnumber of effects such as the reduction of wrinkles  or the revitalisation of the skin,  Marbert  \nstate that Skin Garantie \u2019s \u201ceffectiveness is scienctifically proven\u201d 913  while Vitamol\u2019 s pedigree \nincludes consequent Swiss research carried out by S wiss scientists. 914  Most brands go to \nsome length to educate consumers on the skin\u2019s func tioning, sometime even introducing the \nphotograph and signature of an expert, such as Dr E . Charlet from the Drugofa  company in \nK\u00f6ln who presents the Quenty  line, featuring collagen and placenta extract, the  star \ningredients of the time: \u201cThe skin begins to age from the age of 25. The und erlying reason for \nthis are changes in the collagen fibres that are re inforced by damaging environmental \ninfluences. The skin becomes increasingly dry and w ithered. Now the first lines are visible.\u201d915  \nIn a more dramatic vein, the French brand Biotherm \u2019s strategy is to present its \u00c9mulsion \n                                                 \n909  Ad for Stendhal Les Bio-Program ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 23, 1980):  \u201cErkenntnissen modernster kosmetologischer \nForschung\u201d ; \u201creine nat\u00fcrliche Aktivsubstanzen\u201d  \n910  Ibid.: \u201e Nat\u00fcrliche Widerstandskraft f\u00fcr empfindliche Haut\u201c;  \u201eein klares, \u00fcberschaubares und wirksames \nKonzept, das sich den Hautanforderungen und den per s\u00f6nlichen Bed\u00fcrfnissen unserer Zeit anpa\u00dft.\u201c  \n911  Ad for Pierre Robert Pflegeserie ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 6, 1980): \u201e Entdecken Sie das Sch\u00f6nheitsideal der Schweden mit \nder neuen Pflegeserie von Pierre Robert aus dem Lan d der unber\u00fchrten Naur mit seinen frischen Quellen und \nklaren Bergseeen.

This can \nonly be attained through the correct analysis of th e skin: \u201cWithin 30 seconds, the Linique skin \nanalyzer developed by leading dermatologists reveal s your true skin-type and tells you how \nto obtain better looking skin.\u201d  The ad then specifies that this analysis can be ca rried out at \nany Linique retailer and the accompanying photograp h features the analyzer with its eight \nhorizontal slots including explanations.

For \ninstance, Marbert  in the promotion for its Sensitive  line states that almost 50% of women \nhave sensitive skin 919  and emphasises the environmental stress that the s kin is submitted to: \n\u201cThe wind, the weather, stress and tensions are a b urden for your skin\u201d .920  The French RoC \ncosmetics company \u2013a pioneer in scent-free cosmetic s 921 \u2013 goes a step further when \nvaunting its products as \u201chypoallergenic\u201d . Before explaining the meaning of the latter, the \ntext of the ad first states that many women\u2019s skin tends to be allergic and thus requires \nspecial hypoallergenic care: \u201cCosmetics can only be called hypoallergenic, if th ey diminish \nallergy risks to a minimum through a scientifically  proven composition.\u201d This is followed by a \nbox detailing the so-called \u201cRoC-Garantie\u201d: \n \n\u2022RoC products contain only high-quality pure ingred ients that are proven to be particularly \nkind to the skin by dermatologists. \u2022RoC contains n o fragrance. \u2022RoC contains no irritating \n                                                 \n916  Ad for Biotherm \u00c9mulsion Vitale ( Brigitte , Heft 3, 1980).  \n917  The German-speaking equivalent of the Est\u00e9e Lauder  \u201cClinique\u201d brand, which was originally launched in  \n1946, cf. http://www.elcompanies.com/heritage/timeline.php .

Introduced by Estee Lauder in 1967, Clinique \nprojected its hygienic, asexual message in a number  of ways, from its trade name and antiseptic green \npackaging, to its neutral color palette and adverti sing. Its \u2018Twice a Day\u2019 ad, likening skin care to t he regular use \nof a toothbruch, focused exclusively on the product , not on glamorous or sexual situations. \u2018Our consu mer \ndoesn\u2019t want to live her life through someone else, \u2019 the company\u2019s president explained. \u2018She looks at makeup as \ninformation.\u2019 Clinique became the cosmetic line of choice for many professional women and feminists.\u201d \n918  Ad for Linique Hautanalysator ( Brigitte , Heft 19, 1980): \u201e Der Linique Hautanalysator-kosmetische Aufkl\u00e4rung \nzum Wohl Ihrer Haut.

Surprisingly, however, there is no mention of tolerance tests though \u2013which \nfrom our perspective may seem like the first charac teristic one would expect from this kind \nof product.

An \nenlightening example of the former is provided by a  F\u00fcr Sie  article. It begins with a reference \nto the future duty of declaration [Deklarationspfli cht], a law forcing cosmetic producers to \nreveal all the ingredients contained in their produ cts. 927  According to the author, this move \nwill enable consumers to understand either the pric e of the products or, for those who are \nallergic, to find out (more) about potential allerg ens. The article goes on to emphasise that \nthe main component of most cosmetic products is oil  whether vegetable, animal or \nsynthetic. Oils are supposed to keep the skin smoot h but can also trigger violent allergies. \nProducts are then listed with the specificities of their combinations \u2013be it oil in water for day \ncreams or water in oil for night creams, tortoise o r shark oil in eye cream or paraffine oil in \nmascara, castor oil in lipstick or the special hydr ophilic oils contained in make-up remover \nthat help to remove dirt and skin impurities as wel l as regulate the skin lipids. 928   \n \nAgony aunt columns, on the other hand, respond to s pecific queries and anguishes sent in by \nreaders. These extend from dry skin to self-tanning  lotions, radical diets (which make breasts \nshrink and wither), rosacea, swelling beneath the e yes, blemished skin, perfumes, beauty \nfarms, scars left from acne and how to handle conta ct lenses when applying make-up. In the \ncase of F\u00fcr Sie,  it is a physician, Frau Dr. Panka-Dietz, 929  who answers in a no nonsense way. \nThe column emphasises the quality of the counsellin g offered:  \n \nA decisive criterion for our reader advice column i s the professional cosmetic knowledge of \nall our employees as well as an overview of the ent ire cosmetics market. Through close \ncollaboration with dermatologists and the industry,  we are not only informed about novelties \nand scientific progress but are also warned about t he dangers linked to inappropriate \ntreatment. 930   \n \n                                                 \n925  Ad for Kaloderma Creme ( Frau im Spiegel , Heft 23, 1980): \u201eIrgendwann entdeckt eine Frau Kaloderma\u2026\u201c ; \n\u201eKaloderma Creme gibt der Haut, was sie braucht: Pf lege und Feuchtigkeit\u201c.  \n926  Ad for Mouson Kosmetik ( Frau im Spiegel , Heft 23, 1980): \u201eMouson macht sch\u00f6n\u201c.  \n927  An obligation discussed earlier on in this chapter .   \n928  \u201cHaut wie Samt und Seide: Die feinen kosmetischen \u00d6le sind unerl\u00e4\u00dflich f\u00fcr unsere t\u00e4gliche Hautpflege . Wir \nsagen Ihnen, warum\u201c ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 6, 28.02.1980, p. 90). \n929  From my perspective, it is impossible to find out if Dr Panka-Dietz is an actual physician or an inve nted \nauthority conjured to uphold the scientific credibi lity of the information provided. \n930  \u201eDas wollten unserere Leserinnen wissen: Seit mehr  als 10 Jahren l\u00f6st Frau Dr. Panka-Dietz die \nkosmetischen Probleme unserer Leser\u201c ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 6, 28.02.1980, pp. 98-99, p. 98): \u201eEntscheidend f\u00fcr unsere \nLeserberatung ist das kosmetische Fachwissen aller Mitarbeiter und der \u00dcberblick \u00fcber den gesamten \nKosmetikmarkt. In enger Zusammenarbeit mit Dermatol ogen und der Industrie sind wir nicht nur \u00fcber \nNeuheiten und wissenschaftliche Fortschritte inform iert, sondern k\u00f6nnen auch die Gefahren einer falsch en \nBehandlung erkennen.\u201c  220 \n \nProfessionalism and scientific methods are thus ens ured. However, this does not exclude a \nholistic approach. To a reader complaining about ex tremely dry skin and wondering whether \nit might be due to a recent existential shock, the doctor replies: \u201cThe skin is not just a \nreflexion of the state of our bodies. In your case,  it is quite plausible that the emotional \nburden is the underlying cause.\u201d 931  Occasionally, beyond various specifically cosmetic  \nrecommendations, the physician\u2019s advice also includ es very practical holistic strategies: e.g. \nmassages, gymnastics or swimming, while recommendin g the avoidance of e.g. alcohol, \ncoffee or sunbathing. \n \n1983: Highly scientific, sensitive and fit \nLater in the 1980s, the market seems to witness an increasing amount of high-tech creams \nand lotions. The discourse surrounding these produc ts is very similar: it emphasises tests, \nproofs, the status of science and it also increasin gly relies on high-tech instrumentation and \nsophisticated illustrations. Revlon \u2019s slogan, for instance states: \u201cTested by physicians \u2013 \nconfirmed by women\u201d . 932  Lanc\u00f4me  emphasises that: \u201cNumerous experiments prove the \nvisible results of Progr\u00e8s Intensif Rides, after ju st two weeks of use\u201d 933   while Alcina  soberly \nstates that: \u201cEccelente mirrors the high level of dermatological  science.\u201d  934  But Biotherm  \ngoes even further: \u201cThis double effect has been scientifically proven:  the electron-\nmicroscopical study clearly shows the restoration o f the skin\u2019s surface. 935  Scientific discourse \nis often reinforced by explanatory statistics, diag rams, photographs or other illustrations, as \nin the Biotherm  case, where two boxes display the structure of a d ehydrated epithelium as \nopposed to an adequately moisturised one: in the fi rst case the cells are schematically \nrepresented as dried up beans through which water i s excessively drained. The following \ncomment is appended: \u201cThe cells let too much water through. The cells ar e dried up.\u201d The \nsecond drawing shows cells as rounded and regular a s smarties. In this configuration water \nrequires more detours to evaporate from the surface , prompting the following comment: \n\u201cThe loss of water is controlled. Cells are filled with water.\u201d 936  Another ad for a Biotherm \ncream, this time the so-called Special Rides  backs up its claims by displaying macro-\nphotographs of the skin surface with the following discourse: \n \nPhotographs prove the efficacy. Over 1,000 macro-ph otographs were taken in the course of a \n6-week experiment. These close-ups show the effect stages of CREME SPECIAL RIDES on over \n100 test persons of various ages. The proof.

After a 6-week treatmen t the difference is very visible. \n                                                 \n931  Ibid. p. 98: \u201e Die Haut ist nicht nur ein Spiegelbild unserer K\u00f6rp erlichen Verfassung.

The skin is smoother and more \nharmonious.  937   \n \nThis wish to document \u201cbefore and after\u201d states and  thus provide \u201cproof\u201d of effectiveness \nrepresents a leitmotiv in the cosmetic discourse of  the following decades. Another \ninteresting example in this \u201cscientific\u201d category a re the ads for Viviane , the so-called \n\u201cthinking cream\u201d  that adapts to every face because \u201cits new emulsion system actually \ncombines the care provided by a rich cream with the  moisturising properties of a milky \nlotion.\u201d 938  While it may still be a far cry from Happyderm \u2013th e product I quoted in my \nintroduction to this case study\u2013 and its phytodorph ines [sic] that are supposed to boost skin \nhappiness, 939  the idea of an \u201cintelligently adaptive\u201d cream is r ather revolutionary for the \ntime. Another ad for the same cream provides long e xplanations over a whole page. \nScientific backing here is provided by the fact tha t \u201c[t]ogether with dermatologists and \ncosmetics professionals, scientists from Schering\u2019s  skin research have developed a novel \ndouble-emulsion system that imitates the skin\u2019s nat ural water and oil film.\u201d  The text ends \nwith a reminder that Viviane can only be obtained i n pharmacies and provides the following \nrationale:  \n \nThe international pharmaceutical corporation Scheri ng has developed many successful \ndermatological creams. VIVIANE itself was developed  at the suggestion of dermatologists. \nThe pharmacist is in the best position to judge tha t skincare is in the very best hands at \nSchering\u2019s, since he is aware of his responsibility  when it comes to sensitive skin problems. \nHis advice is more focused on knowledge about the s kin and that is important nowadays. \nIndeed, every woman\u2019s closest companion is her own skin.  940  \n \nThe text thus highlights another important mediatio n partner in the ranks of the scientific \nintelligentsia: the (male!) pharmacist and his prof essional knowledge.

Schlie\u00df lich ist \njeder Frau die eigene Haut am n\u00e4chsten.\u201d 222 \n \nexperience has a decisive impact on the state of th e skin: \u201cA woman\u2019s existential experiences \n\u2013both the significant and the less significant\u2013 imp act not just her personality but also her \nskin\u201d.  The ad therefore recommends \u201ca healthy portion of cheerfulness\u201d  besides the \ncollagen-rich cream. 941  \n  \nOtherwise, within the scientific discourse niche, a  subfield is dramatically expanding: that of \nproducts for sensitive skins, the emergence of whic h I described in the previous section. As \nwas the case then, the \u201e-free\u201c discourse is repeate dly emphasised, e.g. as in Avon \u2019s slogan \nfor Pure Care : \u201cNo perfume. No colourings. Only care\u201d .942  Beyond this type of discourse, an \nad for RoC products emphasises the transparency of its product s: \u201cOpen and honest\u201d or \u201cWe \nhave nothing to hide\u201d \u2013 before stating the following: \u201eNot everyone follows this scientific \nconcept. But we believe that your natural beauty is  absolutely entitled to it.\u201d 943  This \n\u201ctransparency\u201d postulate represents an interesting antithesis to the otherwise often \nsecretive strategies involving mysterious ingredien ts that are privileged by many brands \u2013no \ndoubt also to protect their costly patents.  \n \nBut the most striking development in this field (wh ich I also hinted at in the previous section) \nis the development of a fully-fledged \u201cenvironmenta l stress\u201d rhetoric. I am including three \nexamples that display different perceptions of what  are the most significant environmental \nstress factors. Clarins  emphasises dimensions that may be difficult to inf luence individually: \n\u201cBe sensitive to your delicate skin since pollution , air-conditioners, dust, heat and cold \nalready put enough pressure on it\u201d ,944  whereas Toscana  adds factors that are strongly \ninfluenced, if not determined by individual lifesty les: \u201cNowaday the skin is increasingly \nendangered. More and more women experience sensitiv e skin due to pollution, stress, lack of \nmovement and the hectic rhythm of everyday life\u201d. 945  The coupling of stress as a generic \nphenomenon with everyday hustle and bustle reinforc es the impression that individuals are \ncaught in a treadmill existence, which is paradoxic ally characterised by sedentariness. But by \nfar the most interesting discourse is outlined in a n ad for Payot \u2019s Amniotique  products. \nRather unsurprisingly the ad begins thus: \u201cToday many influences disturb the sensitive \nbalance of your skin \u2013 the wind and the weather, em otional tensions, the polluted \nenvironment and the normal cycle of life. Its sensi tivity makes it vulnerable and thus easily \nunattractive\u201d . 946  Environmental stress here, if it does have an exte rnal component in the \nshape of pollution and weather, has a strong intern al correlate in the shape of emotional \ntension, whereas everyday stress is normalised into  a form of natural rhythm. In a way, this \nmakes the effect of the cream all the more surprisi ng:   \n \n                                                 \n941  Ad for Placentubex line ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 19, 1983): \u201eAlle kleinen und gro\u00dfen Erfahrungen im Leben einer  Frau \npr\u00e4gen nicht nur ihre Pers\u00f6nlichkeit.

Ex ceptionally rich, soothing and boosting \nsubstances care for and strengthen your sensitive s kin and protect it from the harshness of \nlife. It becomes smooth, soft and delicate again an d can better resist a tough environment. 947  \n \nSuddenly, the relatively neutral depiction of the e nvironment shifts to menacing undertones, \nwith \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d implications. In thi s context, the skin is represented as a \ndefenseless baby that requires a form of \u201coral regr ession\u201d in the shape of a protective pouch \nprovided by the cream. This amniotic fluid imitatio n paradoxically implies that the late \nmodern individual has been betrayed by an environme nt implicitly denatured by technology \nbut that a technology imitating nature can provide a survival shield \u2013a new nature of sorts.  \n  \nIn contrast, avowedly natural cosmetics seem to be less forgrounded in these years. There \nare still the typical Aok  ads that peddle David Hamilton style images of pre tty young women \nin lace dresses sniffing daisies in a meadow with t he following injunction: \u201cRetain a sense of \nthe natural. Enjoy simple things. Reexperience the beauty of the woods, the meadows and \nthe flowers. Be a closer ally of nature\u201d .948  But a more subtle type of intermingling between \nscientific and natural discourse seems to be taking  place as illustrated by an ad for the \nVitamol  line that features a photograph of and a pseudo-in terview with a certain Inge B., a \nZurich photographer. Towards the middle of the inte rview, the following section is \nhighlighted: \n \nI know that the skin itself cannot produce vitamins , which is why I use Vitamol with its \nbalanced vitamin complex. This skincare gives me a fresh and youthful appearance. \nMoreover, my sensitive skin tolerates Vitamol bette r than most products. Hmmm, nature \ndoes indeed provide the best cosmetics.  949   \n \nThis assertion is particularly significant of the c ontemporary mindset because, on the one \nhand, it recognises the limits of nature, i.e. the skin (as a natural being) is incapable of \nproducing its own food, which means technology has to come to the rescue with a vitamin \ncream. But on the other hand, technology is natural ised because vitamins are part of \nNature\u2019s bounty.  \n \nThe next noteworthy development is an increasing se gmentation of the offer according to \nage. There, opinions seem to diverge as to the appr opriate age to start providing special care \nfor the skin. Lysmina  for example states: \u201cFor a growing number of women, their skin \nbecomes demanding and sensitive at an increasingly early age. This is why skincare should \n                                                 \n947  Ibid.: \u201eAmniotique tr\u00e4nkt die Hautzellen mit einem Wirksto ff-Komplex, den die Natur selbst als erste \nembryonale Zellnahrung hervorbringt: dem Amnion Liq uide.

Erleben Si e mal wieder, wie sch\u00f6n W\u00e4lder, Wiesen und Blumen s ind. \nSeien Sie ein bi\u00dfchen mehr mit der Natur im Bunde.\u201c   \n949  Ad for Vitamol Schweizer Vitamin-Kosmetik ( Brigitte , Heft 9, 1983): \u201eIch weiss, dass die Haut selbst keine \nVitamine bilden kann. Deshalb nehme ich Vitamol mit  der ausgewogenen Vitamin-Kombination. Und diese \nPflege gibt mir ein jugendlich-frisches Aussehen. A usserdem vertr\u00e4gt meine empfindliche Haut Vitamol s o gut, \nwie kaum etwas anderes. Tja, Die Natur hat eben die  besten Sch\u00f6nheitsmittel.\u201c   224 \n \nstart at 25 so as to support the natural functions of the skin.\u201d 950  Although this discourse is \nnot explicitly related to an environmental stress f actor, one can plausibly assume a \nconnection since the text goes on to describe what substances are required to support these \nfunctions. The \u201cactive collagen and elastin complex, precious plan t jojoba oil, the natural \nmoisturising factor (NMF) and a special UVB filter\u201d  seem to imply that environmental \nconditions have a strongly dessicating effect on th e skin. Aok  situates the need for special \ncare at a later moment: \u201cTake more time now for face care because, from the  age of 30, the \nskin gradually loses its elasticity and natural reg eneration diminishes\u201d .951  But the most self-\nconsciously developed segment is that of mature ski n as exemplified (and apparently \npioneered) by Quenty forty : \u201cQuenty forty was specially developed for skin afte r 40. At this \nage the skin increasingly loses its tonus and elast icity.\u201d 952  In contrast with the casual garb of \nthe younger models in the afore-mentioned ads, this  ad presents a youthful-looking but \nartfully controlled woman. Her hairstyle, make-up, jewellery and clothing are low-key but \nflattering and her gaze seems to reflect a mature s elf-confidence. This \u201cpower-styling\u201d thus \nsuggests that if 40-year old skin is more demanding , it is just a reflection of the general \nentitlement entailed by experience. \n \nAnother aspect worth mentioning is the emergence of  \u201cfitness\u201d for the skin as exemplified in \ncreams manufactured by Marbert  or Guerlain . The first company presents Splendance  as \n\u201cface fitness\u201d  and describes the cream as both \u201chigh-performance care\u201d  and \u201cprogressive \nbeauty care\u201d , thus highlighting two pillars of this ideology: p erformance and progress. 953  \nGuerlain \u2019s Ultra-Sport  face cream depicts a sportily but smartly dressed young woman (in \ncorduroy trousers, a houndstooth blazer, a white sh irt and tie). A black dog is clamped \nbetween her legs and she firmly holds both his coll ar and the leash. The caption reads: \n \nNaturalness embarks on a career. \u201cFormule Vitalisan te\u201d simulates the fundamental functions \nof the epidermis and reinforces its natural defence s. The grapeseed oil and linol\u00e9ate d\u2019\u00e9thyle \n[sic]  active complex provide the skin with \u201cbeauty build ing blocks\u201d in the shape of \nunsaturated fatty acids.

M oreover, the Ultra Sport  name suggests \nvalues of performance and progress similar to those  voiced in the Marbert  ad while \nemphasising the programmatic aspect of skincare in the 1980s. Beauty may seem natural but \nit requires a heck of a lot of work: the number of steps (including cleansing, toning, \nmoisturising, vitalising & protecting) required in order to keep the skin fit and competitive \nbelies the vaunted uncomplicatedness of the program me.  \n \nCosmetic programmes are also part and parcel of wom en\u2019s magazines beauty advice. An \narticle in F\u00fcr Sie , for example, recommends that women from 30 onward s take better care of \ntheir skins: \u201cEven if you feel really well both bodily and menta lly and you are fully satisfied \nwith the image in your mirror \u2013 your skin is actual ly beginning to age now. But this is no \nreason to give up quietly. You can do a lot for you r appeareance. We show you what.\u201d  A \nblurb recommends doing a skin test before buying ne w products because the skin tends to \nget drier with age. Practical advice then includes how to cleanse properly (avoiding \u201cthe \naggressive products of the \u2018spotty\u2019 years\u201d ), the daily use of special eye cream as well as \nmassaging large amounts of cream (with a good balan ce between moisturising and fatty \ningredients) on both face and neck as well as the d aily use of a special night cream. In terms \nof body care, the article also advocates daily spor ts \u2013especially swimming or daily gymnastics \nwith dumbbells and a daily massage with a special a nti-orange skin appliance under the \nshower not to mention a massage cream afterwards. 956   \n \nAs to novel products, one can mention Aapri  cream wash that replaces soap for delicate face \nskin. 957  But the greatest novelty is gel that is introduced  in all sorts of products from haircare \nto gel masks, eye, face, body and foot gels not to mention gel toothpaste and gel-based \nmake-up (mainly lip gloss and rouge). Beyond the ob vious advantage of being transparent \nand thus signalling a certain \u201cpurity\u201d, an article in Brigitte  lists the advantages of gel-based \nproducts thus: \u201cGels are easily spread on the skin,  they do not stick and are very good at \ntransporting active ingredients\u201d. 958   \n \n1985-1986: Energy against stress and the battle aga inst age \nCleansing, clearing and scrubbing become increasing ly important steps in the mid-1980s \nwith more ads for peelings, make-up remover and ton ic from Aapri , Nivea  or CD . The main \nmotto seems to be best expressed by the Nivea  or Aapri  slogans: respectively \u201cthoroughly \n                                                 \n955  This ester seems to be endowed with emollient and fragrance/flavour-enhancing properties: Cf. e.g. \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/consumers/cosmetics/cosing/inde x.cfm?fuseaction=search.details_v2&id=76066  [website \naccessed Aug. 2011].   \n956  \u201eDer aktuelle Sch\u00f6nheitplan f\u00fcr die Frau um 30\u201c ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 19, 31.08.83, pp. 38 ss.): \u201eAuch wenn Sie sich \nk\u00f6rperlich und seelisch richtig wohl f\u00fchlen und Ihr  Spiegelbild Sie voll zufriedenstellt\u2014Ihre Haut beg innt \nsp\u00e4testens jetzt zu altern.

More than in other products, naturalness is \nrepeatedly invoked: \u201cDiscover your absolutely natural beauty\u201d (Aapri ), \u201cit contains naturally \npure ingredients\u201d  (CD ) or \u201cThe natural beauty of your skin awakens\u201d  (Nivea ).959  \n \nSurprisingly however, natural cosmetics seem to be rather weakly represented. Claire Fisher  \ncosmetics appear new on the market 960  and the type of discourse used to market these \nproducts appears very similar to the one used for s ensitive and allergic skin. Additional \nclaims include the fact that they contain \u201cnatural active ingredients which have a proven \nnormalizing and soothing effect\u201d , that products can be returned \u201cif not tolerated or \nqualitatively flawed\u201d  and most interestingly that \u201call products are sensibly preserved: as little \nas possible but as much as required, so that germs and bacteria do not spoil them, thus \ncausing irritations of the skin.\u201d 961  This last claim anticipates nature puritans\u2019 poten tial \ncriticism by stating that a moderate use of chemist ry is necessary to counteract the \nunhealthy proliferation of an unwanted nature. \n \nAnother tack taken by mainstream cosmetics that see k the natural aura is to quote nature as \na sort of pedigree without providing any concrete i nformation on the ingredients actually \nused. A good example is an ad by Ellen Betrix  vaunting the merits of the Pure + Natural  line \nthat \u201cprotects and cares for your skin with the strength s of nature and provides it with all the \nindispensable building blocks and precious active i ngredients that it really needs and can \nassimilate.\u201d  962   The ad never reveals any of the cream\u2019s component s so the \u201cstrengths of \nnature\u201d  are bound to remain mysterious. Similarly, even if  Yves Rocher  does reveal the main \ningredient in its so-called D.N.S. v\u00e9g\u00e9tal  \u201cfrom the origin of nature\u201d , as a cosmetic foray into \nnascent industrially-oriented genetic engineering, it remains enigmatic:   \n \nDNA is a biological substance that can be found in the nucleus.

DNS v\u00e9g\u00e9tal aktiviert die 227 \n \n \nSeveral conclusions can be drawn from these explana tions. First of all, the concept of \n\u201cnucleus\u201d, \u201cgenetic information\u201d and presumably DNA  [deoxyribonucleic acid; in German \nDesoxyribonukleins\u00e4ure \u2013 DNS] appear to be prevalen t enough to be included in a vulgarised \nbiotechnological explanation. Secondly, the process  that unfolds in plants is seen as directly \napplicable and beneficial to the human skin. Thirdl y \u2013if only implicitly\u2013 the type of nature \noffered here is only accessible through high-tech m ethods and its effectiveness must be \nproven by scientific tests.  \n \nMore classically,  Aok  continues to articulate its rhetoric around a rath er clich\u00e9d nature-\ncentred discourse with several attempts at defining  it as a fountain of youth: \u201cNature is \nalways young, because it has the strength to regene rate itself year after year\u201d 964  or as the \nultimate panacea: \u201cNature \u2013 that is strength, health, beauty and life \u201d .965  It also encourages \nits consumers with a rather weird injunction: \u201cBuild an alliance with nature \u2013 against stress \nand the environment. For naturally beautiful skin.\u201d966  It is not the alliance with nature that is \nsurprising here since this was already the essence of Aok \u2019s motto in the early 1980s \u2013 a fact \nunderscored by a small picture of a young woman gat hering plants in a rocky landscape. \nNeither is the anti-stress discourse revolutionary.  Rather, it is the coalition against the \nenvironment that is new and perturbing, since in th is case the \u201cenvironment\u201d is not \nperceived in the now dominant ecological acceptatio n but as the threatening and hectic \nman-made (urban) landscape.  \n \nEven in more mainstream products, discourse focuses  on the deadly stress and environment \ncouple. Lian  soberly states: \u201cEvery day, your skin is burdened by stress and the  \nenvironment\u201d 967  whereas Placentubex f rames negative influences with a \u201cscientific\u201d backi ng:  \n\u201cScientists note that stress, indoor climate and in creasingly strong environmental influences \ndeprive your skin of its youthful freshness earlier  than ever.\u201d 968  In these two examples, it \nseems that the environment is again understood as t he threatening man-made one. In \ncontrast, \u00c9lastine privileges a more subjective and  down-to-earth perspective: \u201cMy skin is an \nexpression of my well-being and the traces left by stress, hustle and bustle, dust and wind get \nto my skin.\u201d .969  Which is why Lysmina  suggests the following cure: \u201cEvery day retire from \nyour environment for a few minutes. Give yourself a  break. Treat your skin to a little \nrelaxation.\u201d  If this advice smacks of Eastern meditative influe nces, this impression is \nreinforced by the picture of a woman in a short kim ono-style robe sitting in a simplified \nlotus-position and holding a tray where all the pro ducts of the Lysmina  line are careful \npositioned \u2013all this against a rice paper screen ba ckground reminiscent of a tea ceremony. 970  \n                                                                                                                                                         \nZellerneuerung der Epidermis und schenkt der Haut n eue Dynamik und Spannkraft.

The first company claims that its Double S\u00e9rum Multi-R\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rant  \n(comprising an Hydra S\u00e9rum  and a Lipo S\u00e9rum ) combine 17 main ingredients and supports 5 \nfunctions: \u201cregeneration, revitalisation, moisture regulation,  skin respiration and \nprotection\u201d 971  \u2013 functions that are reflected in another French prod uct, Energie Active  by \nBiotherm , a day cream that promises the same palette in sli ghtly altered words: \u201cmoisture \nbalancing, regeneration, revitalization, oxygen exc hange, skin-like protection\u201d .972  Activation \nis also a key-word in the ads for Lanc\u00f4me \u2019s S\u00e9rum Oligo-Major  (combining animal tissue and \nyeast extracts as well as minerals) 973  or Juwel-Regenerations-Activum  (also with minerals and \nvitamin E) 974  and Helena Rubinstein \u2019s Existence Skin Building Serum  \u2013a particularly apt name \nin the heart of the fitness era. This impression is  reinforced by a facial massage appliance, \nthe so-called Dermoaktivator  and a statement whereby the firm has made the \n\u201crevolutionary\u201d discovery that \u201cskin needs energy, in order to remain strong and t aut\u201d .975  \n \nAnother central emphasis in those years is on night  creams. They should be used because \n\u201cToday, sleep as a natural recuperation process no longer suffices to eliminate signs of \ntiredness from the skin, since it is burdened by st ress and environmental influencs.\u201d 976  Nature \nhere is seen as losing against the negative side-ef fects of technology. Night creams are thus \na privileged tool to regenerate the skin since the skin\u2019s biorhythmic curve 977  seems to imply \nthat \u201ccell regeneration is particularly effective during  the night, which is why the skin is \nparticularly receptive to nurturing active ingredie nts\u201d . This process should make it easier to \ncounter \u201cnegative environmental influences such as exhaust gases, hard water, dry heat, \ndust and stress\u201d . 978  \n \n                                                 \n971  Ad for Clarins Double S\u00e9rum ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 24, 1985): \u201c Regeneration, Revitalisierung, \nFeuchtigkeitsregulierung, Hautatmung und Hautschutz \u201c.  \n972  Ad for Biotherm Energie Active ( prima , Heft 11, 1986): \u201c Feuchtigkeits-Ausgleich, Regenerierung, \nRevitalisierung, Sauerstoffaustauch, hauteigener Sc hutz\u201c.  \n973  Ad for Lanc\u00f4me\u2019s S\u00e9rum Oligo-Major ( prima,  Heft 3, 1986). \n974  Ad for Juwel-Regenerations-Activum in Ampullen ( Frau im Spiegel , Heft 39, 1986).

Einmal geht es um die  \nDurchblutung, zum anderen um die Zellerneuerung.\u201c  Further he specifies the times when the skin is es pecially \nactive: \u201e[...] morgens zwischen f\u00fcnf und sechs Uhr, nachmit tags ab 17 Uhr, gegen 21.30 und von 22 Uhr wieder \nbis morgens um f\u00fcnf Uhr.\u201c  (Brigitte , Heft 7, 1986, pp. 67 ss., p. 67).  \n978  Ad for Ellen Betrix Effect Rich Night Care ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 22, 1985): \u201eNachts l\u00e4uft die Zellerneuerung auf \nHochtouren.

The rationale here is that since the cream \nwas especially conceived for delicate baby skin, it  is also perfectly adapted to any adult \nsensitive skin. Hence \u2013as a family cream\u2013 it is eve n more multifunctional. 980  \n \nCreams for an older segment, which were launched in  the previous years, are really \nbooming, as displayed by the two leaders in the fie lds: Quenty Forty  and Harriet Hubbard \nAyer . The former, a German firm, continues along the li nes developed until then: it \nemphasises the justifiable claims of older skin and  displays understatedly elegant forty-\nsomethings. 981  And the latter, a company based upon the legacy of  Harriet Hubbard Ayer, 982  \nuses models that radiate an even stronger \u201csuperwom an\u201d aura. The mature, self-assured \nsophistication emanating from these women is also r einforced by the following texts: \u201cI have \ndecided. I use Radiance Energy . Today I know what I want. I want to enjoy my job and I feel \ncomfortable in my own skin\u201d or \u201cI know what I want. I use the Double Action Line . Just as I \nattach great importance to quality for all the impo rtant things in life, I make high demands \non my cosmetics.\u201d 983  These ads seem to pay a tribute to the increasing professionalisation of \nwomen, a development that is seen as providing them  with increased self-confidence and \u2013\nimplicitly\u2013 purchasing power. \n \nFeature articles concentrate on the everlasting ant i-ageing preoccupation, i.e. wrinkles and \nhow to prevent them.

Avoiding prolonged \nsunbathing, wearing sunglasses to avoid creases aro und the eyes and avoiding drastic weight \ngains or losses are general rules that are also lis ted in the article. While these \nrecommendations are not new and represent the backb one of most cosmetic vulgarisation \narticles, their enumeration in parallel with the wo man\u2019s previous routine appears almost \noverwhelming \u2013as much in terms of time and money in vestment as ideologically. Indeed, it \ndisplays westernised societies\u2019 internalised expect ations about women, whose self-worth \nand social recognition are intimately tied to value s of youth, performance and \nattractiveness, hence appropriate grooming \u2013values which at that point in time do not yet \napply as stringently to men.  \n \nAnother article, in prima 985  this time, details how wrinkles emerge, describes the best anti-\nwrinkle substances and a couple of novelties in the  field before answering the question of \npotential habituation to anti-wrinkle creams. Besid es explaining the intricacies of skin \nmetabolism to the lay reader, the most interesting section is the one detailing advances in \ncosmetology and its limits: \n \nRecently, scientists have found new ways to counter  the declining vitality of the skin. One of \nthe strategies are active ingredients: the \u201cje ne s ais quoi\u201d in creams, ampoules and lotions \nthat boosts the metabolism, improves the cellular s tructure, and mitigates natural \ndeficiencies, without crossing the boundary to phar macy, because this is forbidden for \ncosmetics. Moreover, nowadays the effects \u2013 even in  depth \u2013 are provable thanks to state-\nof-the-art scientific methods. 986   \n \nEven though cosmetics, as a field in which scientis ts are described as the motors of \ndiscovery, potentially submits itself to the burden  of scientific proof, these very scientists \nhave to walk a tightrope between effectiveness and a clear demarcation from pharmacy. \nHowever the article does not articulate the nature of this demarcation and the scant \nexplanations provided for specific substances \u2013from  aloe vera to RNA through collagen, \nelastin, carotene, royal jelly, hyaluronic acide, N MF (natural moisturising factor), panthenol, \nphytohormones, \u201cRepair Complex\u201d and retinol\u2013 do not  really enable a lay-reader to grasp \nthe significant differences between the two fields.  To wit, ribonucleic acid is defined thus: \n\u201cStimulates the production of new cells and partici pates in the protein synthesis of skin cells\u201d . \nOther explanations fluctuate between the rather amb itiously specialised use of \n\u201cmucopolysaccharide\u201d  to describe hyaluronic acid (embedded in a more st raightforward \nexplanation, it is true), a terse but understandabl e formulation such as \u201cA package of natural \nmoisturising factors, such as: lactic acid, urea, s ugar derivatives\u201d  for NMF 987  and the rather \n                                                 \n985  \u201eL\u00e4nger sch\u00f6ne und glatte Haut \u2013 das ist m\u00f6glich\u201c ( prima , Heft 9, 1986, p. 109).  \n986  Ibid.: \u201eIn letzter Zeit sind die Wissenschaftler auf neue Wege gesto\u00dfen, wie sie der nachlassenden Vitalit\u00e4t \nder Haut begegnen k\u00f6nnen.

Finally the article ends on a sober note, \nemphasising that if consumers need not fear an habi tuation effect (\u201cAnyway the skin only \nabsorbs and assimilates what it needs\u201d ), anti-wrinkle preparations are only effective whe n \napplied regularly and over a long period, and their  effect subsides over a period of 28 days \nafter application ceases.  988  \n \nIf the two preceding articles have shown the comple xity of everyday routines to fight \nwrinkles and have displayed the sophistication of n ew products, the strategies suggested \nand the effects promised seem rather limited compar ed to more radical ventures to combat \nageing skin, since cosmetology also offers treatmen ts that appear inextricable from \npharmacy \u2013if not cosmetic surgery. A sensational bu t also rather scary anti-wrinkle \nrevolution is exposed in a Bunte article on the new technique developed by an Americ an \ncosmetologist, Alexander Le Bon, and recently impor ted into Germany. 989  Indeed, not only \ndoes the treatment he offers far outstrip the time and financial investments required by \nmore mainstream practices, it also leaves the reade r with nagging doubts about potentially \npernicious physiological and psychological side-eff ects.  \n \nThe main illustration above the title \u201cThirty years younger: a cosmetologist combats faci al \nwrinkles without anaesthesia, scalpel or injections \u201d  exhibits the head of a woman divided in \ntwo: the left half shows a wrinkled granny face and  the right half displays a face where most \n                                                                                                                                                         \n[24].

However, the art icle does later \nemphasise that the method has been perfected from a  process discovered 90 years previously by a \ndermatologist named Garbo Gustavson in New York.  232 \n \nof the creases seem to have been ironed out. The co mplex process labelled as \u201cchemo-\nsurgery\u201d  is then detailed as follows:  \n \nFirst Alexander Le Bon examines the client\u2019s comple xion. Then, on the basis of a secret \nrecipe, he prepares a tincture adapted to the skin,  which he then applies to all the wrinkles \non the face. This procedure lasts almost three hour s. Finally, the face is covered with a \nplaster mask that airtightly seals the treated area . [\u2026] When the plaster mask is removed \n[after 3 days!], the skin is red and still very sen sitive. [\u2026] The face is then treated with a \ncooling powder. [\u2026] On the seventh day a creamy mas k containing healing substances is \napplied and removed on the tenth and final day. Now  the skin is only slightly flushed. 990   \n \nThe method can be summed up as an extremely aggress ive abrasion of the epithelium, \nfollowed by a lengthy healing process of the raw de rmis to form a new \u201crejuvenated\u201d \nepithelium. According to the cosmetologist, the eff ect of the treatment lasts about a year, \nbut the article does not specify whether it can be repeated or not. However, the \ncosmetologist spontaneously insists that \u201cCosmetics are a positive illusion, when they are \ncorrectly applied\u201d  and that this treatment appeals to men and women o f all ages because it \ncan also be used to correct other skin imperfection s such as e.g. a rough skin texture or \npigmentation marks. But the main prerequisite for t he treatment is \u201ca healthy attitude \ntowards oneself\u201d  since \u201c the psychological dimension plays an important role  in cosmetic \ntreatments\u201d . The article closes with enthusiastic reports from  the husband of a client and \nanother female client, as well as a reference to th e costs (8-10,000 DM) of the treatment as \nwell as counterindications. 991  \n \nOther feature articles on cosmetics focus on more t raditional skin care techniques and \nproducts that are not primarily geared towards anti -ageing: from the importance of face and \nbody scrubs, 992  to the care of particular features (e.g. eyes), 993  special seasonal care, 994  as \nwell as specific skin challenges or ailments such a s allergies. An article on the latter not only \nprovides a lay public with a comprehensible clinica l picture of this particular ailment but also \naims to demystify a number of connected myths or as pects. After stating that dermatological \nclinics have compiled lists of potential allergens,  the article goes on to emphasise the \nfollowing: \u201cActually, there are less synthetic substances in t hese than plant-based ones. \nBesides lanolin and certain aromatic compounds, pla nts reputed as \u2018therapeutic\u2019 such as \ncamomile and arnica frequently trigger allergies\u201d . Moreover, it warns against exaggerated \nallergy suspicion: \u201cIf one suddenly reacts with a rash, red patches or  small pimples when \nusing one\u2019s usual or a new cosmetic product, most o f the time it is not an allergy at all. \nIndeed, it could simply be a case of using the wron g product\u201d . Other causes include changing \ncosmetic needs over the years, products that are to o rich for an oily skin or skin that has \n                                                 \n990  Ibid.: \u201e Zuerst untersucht Alexander Le Bon das Hautbild des  Kunden. Dann mixt er nach einem Geheimrezept \neine auf die Haut abgestimmte Tinktur, mit der s\u00e4mt liche Falten im Gesichtsbereich bestrichen werden. Diese \nProzedur dauert fast drei Stunden. Anschlie\u00dfend wir d das Gesicht in einer Pflastermaske verpackt, die das \nbehandelte Feld luftdicht versiegelt.

Surprisingly the Aok \nstaple is much less dominant: it is Claire Fisher  cosmetics that seem to have to have taken \nover in terms of \u201cpresence\u201d. As in the discourse su rrounding mainstream products, the \n\u201cenvironmental stress\u201d rhetoric is also present in natural care advertisements. Claire Fisher  \nrecommends rewarding the skin with its Cr\u00e8me Gel\u00e9e Royal because \u201cafter all, [your skin] \nhas bravely wrestled against environmental influenc es and climate change\u201d .996  Here, an \ninteresting addition to the usual environmental fac tors is the influence of climate change. \nThis reference is in fact rather puzzling since, un til very recently, the impact of climate \nchange may have been (often controversially) charte d for the global ecosystem but not \nreally for the human body, let alone the skin. 997  It thus seems that this reference should be \nread more generally as an additional threat to huma n life.

The outlook for c hanges in prevalence requires further clarification  using \npublished climate models.\u201d  Cf.: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1610-0 387.2008.06676.x/abstract . \n[Websites accessed Aug. 2011]  \n998  Ad for Ellen Betrix Mild + Soft line ( Brigitte , Heft 8, 1989): \u201e Kristallklares Wasser, reine, saubere Luft, \nerfrischender Sommerregen - die pure Natur ist kost bar geworden\u201c.  234 \n \nApotheker Scheller  goes a step further and conjoins environmental str ain with the stress \npotential of synthetics in mainstream cosmetics, 999  thus going even a step further than \ncontemporary discourse on allergy-tested or hypo-al lergenic products: \u201cNowadays, many \nwomen have very sensitive skin. It reacts negativel y to the weather, stress and poor air \nquality, and increasingly also to synthetic substan ces in skincare products\u201d . Which is why this \nproduct line is advertised as containing \u201conly high-quality natural plant extracts, cold-\npressed oils and vegetable fats, but no synthetic c olourings and perfumes\u201d .1000  Similar \nformulations are used by Ellen Betrix : \u201cWith natural active ingredients, with vitamin E. B ut \nperfume- and colouring-free\u201d 1001  as well as shoynear : \u201cThis why shoynear  products contain \nthe greatest possible amount of natural ingredients  and a minimum of emulgators and \npreservatives\u201d .1002   \n \nNevertheless, even if ingredients are as natural as  possible and processing kept to a \nminimum, rational care is stressed as with other ma instream cosmetics. It is thus necessary \nto use products embedded in a specific system, as d escribed in an ad for Claire Fisher : \u201cIt \nprovides systemic care for every skintype: with sof t cleansing, intensive day- and night care \nas well as tender body care\u201d 1003  or in a programme, as expounded in an ad for Apotheker \nScheller : \u201cThis why Apotheker Scheller has consciously design ed its natural cosmetics \nprogramme based on very simple and traditional form ulations\u201d .1004  Finally, even though aloe \nvera has not yet attained its future \u201ccosmetic pana cea\u201d status, it seems to be gradually \ngaining in popularity as an effective moisturiser. 1005  \n \nAs to mainstream products, the appeal of progress a nd performance is still considerable as \nencapsulated in the formula coined by L\u2019Or\u00e9al : \u201cYou keep up with the times. Progress and \nperformance are essential for you\u201d .1006  Strangely, science and technology are particularly  \nextolled in publicity for French cosmetics. 1007  A good example of this phenomenon is \nprovided by Lanc\u00f4me  with its ads for Nios\u00f4me  and Noctos\u00f4me . Alongside a title extolling \n\u201cThe treasures of science\u201d , the first cream is presented against a background  of glass or \nplastic bubbles that supposedly symbolise a revolut ionary discovery: \n \n                                                 \n999  This vision thus contradicts the aforementioned prima  article that reminded its readers that natural \ningredients were more likely to trigger allergies t han synthetic ones. \n1000  Ad for Apotheker Scheller Naturkosmetik ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 16, 1989): \u201e Viele Frauen haben heute sehr \nempfindsame Haut.

This is the first instance I have found of \nthe word \u201cstress\u201d being used in the name of a cream . So-called hydrospheres which are \u201c100 \ntimes smaller than any lipid forms used until now\u201d  form the basis of this \u201ctechnology of the \n21 st  century to solve the problem of the 20 th  century\u201d 1013  \u2013there again a very progressivist \ndiscourse. \n \nStress can also be perceived as the undertone of an  ad for Phas \u2019s \u201cResistance Liposom \nActivcreme\u201d . It portrays a young woman casually but elegantly attired, sitting or rather \nlounging \u2013with her feet up on the opposite seat\u2013 in  what looks like the first class \ncompartment of a train. Her attitude connotes relax ation, since she has taken off her shoes \nand negligently placed her briefcase and her coat o n the neighbouring seat. However, this \nattitude may be misleading since she is clasping a slip of paper and her glasses in her left \nhand whilst balancing what looks like a first-gener ation laptop between her legs with the \nother hand. The caption states: \u201cA fresh look for 18 hours without any signs of tir ed skin\u201d . \nAfter describing the effects of the cream, the text  reads: \u201cThe liposomes regularly release \ntheir active components. Your skin is supplied with  new energy during 18 hours, without \ninterruption.\u201d This spells new resistance against signs of tiredne ss and ageing and the result \nis \u201c a radiant look everyday, from early morning to late  at night\u201d. 1014  Resistance thus \nembodies the tensions of the fitness era: the sport y and relaxed attitude belies a rigorous \nworking schedule. The woman is portrayed as an achi ever but she must give the impression \nthat it is somehow effortless. Resistance  therefore efficiently provides a continuous supply  \nof external energy to a superficially relaxed human  motor: a \u201cconveyor-belt\u201d treatment is \nsuggested to remedy the ills of a \u201cconveyor belt\u201d l ife.

Her clothes are also relaxed bu t smart, an impression reinforced by her \nexpensive looking jewellery. Her legs are splayed a part and she negligently balances a \ncamera on the step before her. Further equipment li es around here as well as what appears \nto be a camera case. Her gaze self-confidently sust ains that of the reader. The cream is \ndescribed as \u201cideal as special care in particularly demanding ti mes\u201d .1015    \n \nBesides this type of sophistication, simpler all-in -one products are a resistant niche as \nemblematised by Margaret Astor  moisturising creams that promote short and \nstraightforward routines such as \u201cshowering 1 x day and Moisturizing Cream N\u00ba 1. 1016  The \nsmall text beneath the bust of a woman smiling unde r the shower emphasises that the skin \nrequires good circulation \u2013provided by a cold showe r\u2013 and moisturising \u2013provided by the \ncream. Another example from the same company states : \u201cMy daily beauty routine: laughing \nand Moisturizing Cream from Margaret Astor\u201d . The accompanying text supports this creed \nby adding \u201cWhen it comes to skincare, I am against thousands of pots and tubes\u201d .1017  But the \nultimate all-in-one cream is no doubt the evergreen  Nivea. Indeed, beyond its existential \nmission \u2013i.e. \u201cNivea Cr\u00e8me. Essential for the skin.\u201d \u2013 it fits into the zeitgeist because it does \nnot require preservatives. The ad goes on to explai n that a blend between the purity and \nquality of the ingredients, the specificity of its water in oil emulsion as well as a special \nmanufacturing process make preservatives superfluou s. 1018    \n \nOtherwise, the market displays an increasing segmen tation: beyond creams for (post-)40 \nyear olds and 30 year olds, 1019  product lines for the younger generation seem to b e \nflourishing, from the bebe  line that states that \u201ccompared to older skin, young skin has \ncompletely different needs\u201d ,1020  to Quenty sporty  that already provides moisturising and \ncollagen for the skin of twenty year olds and above , 1021  to Payot \u2019s Ligne Purifiante  that caters \nto the urgent needs of young combination skin with products that promise to: \u201c\u2022free \nclogged pores \u2022normalise sebaceous secretions \u2022prev ent inflammation \u2022strengthen the skin\u2019s \nnatural defenses, \u2022make blackheads and pimples disa ppear quickly\u201d . 1022  Rather than \nnourishment or regeneration, the emphasis here is o n purification. \n \nIn terms of novelties, one can note the special cle ansing pads advertised by Aapri  that are \npre-drenched in an apricot cleansing lotion with on e side devoted to \u201cin-depth cleansing\u201d  \n                                                 \n1015  Ad for Phas Grand Soin Anti-Rides ( Brigitte , Heft 8, 1989): \u201e ideal als Spezialpflege in Zeiten besonderer \nBeanspruchung\u201c.   \n1016  Ad for Margaret Astor Feuchtigkeitscreme N\u00b0 1 ( prima , Heft 5, 1988): \u201e 1 x t\u00e4glich duschen und \nFeuchtigkeits-Cr\u00e8me N\u00ba 1\u201c.  \n1017  Ad for Margaret Astor Feuchtigkeitscreme ( prima , Heft 12, 1988): \u201e Mein t\u00e4gliches Sch\u00f6nheitsprogramm: \nLachen und Feuchtigkeits-Cr\u00e8me von Margaret Astor\u201c;  \u201eIch bin gegen tausend T\u00f6pfe und Tiegel bei der Pf lege\u201c.  \n1018  Ad for Nivea ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 11, 1989): \u201e Nivea Cr\u00e8me.

His posture \nbetrays an interesting \u201cnew man\u201d vision \u2013blending s trength with vulnerability or \ntenderness\u2013 that will become increasingly ubiquitou s towards the turn of the century. \nIndeed, his slightly uplifted heels and his elbows resting on on his knees emphasise muscle \nbulge while his hands protectively clutch a white t owel against his face. The picture thus \ncomplements the text that develops a particularly i nsistent didactical rhetoric, highlighting \nindividuals\u2019 responsibility in the health of their skins:  \n \nPlease. Change your washing habits. Or your washing  lotion. Dermatologists contend that \nover-frequent washing and showering harms the skin.  This is reason enough to reconsider \none\u2019s views on skincare. A mild washing lotion woul d already be a first step, but not real \nprogress. You should be aware that after each wash tiny particles of the cleaning substances \nremain on the surface of the skin and that, long af ter washing, they \u201cperforate\u201d the natural \nfatty protection of the skin. Thus, depending on sk in type, the protective functions of the skin \ncan lose their balance. Real progress would be a wa shing lotion \u2013such as BASIS pH washing \nlotion\u2013 that has been proven to leave just about no  residue on the skin. Furthermore, it is \nfree of alkaline soap, it is colouring- and fragran ce-free, is very well tolerated by the skin \nwhile containing a balanced proportion of lipid-rep lenishing substances. 1024   \n \nBASIS pH  thus appears to be a genuine forerunner of a trend  towards synthetic washing \nlotions and soaps that will take off much later, i. e. towards the mid- 1990s, while building on \nthe \u201c-free\u201d as well as \u201cenvironmental threat\u201d disco urses that we have already discussed. In \nthis case though, the man-made environment does not  remain anonymous (such as \u201cstress\u201d \nor \u201cpollution\u201d). Instead, it is consumers who are d irectly indicted for a harmful, if still \nunconscious habit. The ad questions a normalised hy gienic procedure \u2013washing one\u2019s body \nwith conventional soaps\u2013 thus implicitly criticisin g most existing soaps. But pointedly, even if \nthe ad does quote dermatologists\u2019 condemnation of e xcessive hygiene, it does not advocate \nwashing less but provides a technological quick-fix  in order to avoid the negative side-effects \nof our modern obsession with cleanliness. 1025   \n \nOtherwise, an ingredient that seems to be making it s mark is an extract from the thymus \ngland that is supposed to have an enhanced rejuvena ting effect. 1026  It should perhaps be \n                                                 \n1023  Ad for Aapri Duo Reinigungs Pads ( Brigitte , Heft 9, 1989): \u201e Tiefenreinigung\u201c; \u201ezarten Gesichtspartien\u201c.  \n1024  Ad for BASIS pH Wasch-Lotion ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 11,1989):  \u201eBitte. \u00c4ndern Sie Ihre Waschgewohnheiten.

Eine milde Wasch-Lotion w\u00e4re da sch on ein \nerster Schritt, aber noch kein Fortschritt.

Und \ndie ist obendrein noch alkaliseifen-frei, farbstoff -frei, parfum\u2013neutral, sehr gut hautvertr\u00e4glich und  enth\u00e4lt \neinen ausgewogenen Anteil an r\u00fcckfettenden Substanz en.\u201c  \n1025  Indeed, according to Ulrich Wengenroth, this advic e contrasts with 1970s mainstream advice to shower \nevery other day or the famed \u201csave water, shower wi th a friend\u201d slogan popularised in the 1960s.  \n1026  An isolated example already stems from 1985, i.e. an ad for Merck Thymoderm ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 22, 1985). \nMore recent examples include ads for Toscana Thymus ome [a coinage drawing on thymus and liposome] ( F\u00fcr \nSie , Heft 12, 1989) and bipharm Sympathik 2000 Liposom en-Gel [Mit hochwirksamem Vitamin A und \nwertvollem Thymusextrakt] ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 12, 1989). 239 \n \nnoted here that animal extracts are extremely frequ ent in mainstream products, especially \ncollagen or placenta extracts. At this point in tim e, there is no trace of placatory discourse to \nspare the sensitivity of animal lovers or simply of  those who may not like the idea of applying \nsubstances derived from aborted animal fetuses onto  their skins\u2026  \n \nThe main obsession of feature articles on skin care  revolves around proven and novel anti-\nageing strategies. Similar explanatory or warning c olumns can be found in all the main \nwomen\u2019s magazines. For example, an article in F\u00fcr Sie  focuses on the conditioning of the \nvarious substances and distinguishes between moistu rising creams, micro-pearls, active sera, \nbeauty capsules, liposomes as well as a new product  category: anti-wrinkle fluids designed \nto be used with special plasters against expression  wrinkles. The plasters supposedly provide \nmechanical assistance to control the effects of emo tional expression on the face:  \n \nOur expressions, triggered by laughing, crying, tal king and frowning, cause wrinkles that \ndeepen over the years. These expressions, which are  so difficult to control, can be restrained \nfor a while by using the special anti-wrinkle plast er. This helps delay the formation of \nwrinkles, the texture of the skin is smoothed out a nd our expressions are trained to diminish \nwrinkle-inducing movements. [\u2026] Since our expressio ns also change during the night, the \nmost practical strategy is to let the plaster work during the night. It can also be used when \none has time at home during the day.  1027    \n \nThese explanations provide a particularly interesti ng illustration of the paradoxes involved in \nskin care: on the one hand, a number of ads and art icles emphasise to what extent positive \nemotional expression \u2013e.g. joy or falling in love\u2013 is a boon for the skin. But on the other \nhand, technological aids are devised to rein this e xpressivity because not even joy should be \nallowed to leave its mark on perfect porcelain skin .  \n \nA couple of other anti-ageing articles show that if  the new products on offer can be \npositively considered, perspectives on the specific  merits of these technoscientific \nachievements vary widely. To wit an article in prima  provides a very dithyrambic (and \nuncritical) perspective on cosmetic progress:  \n \nCosmetic research has impressively progressed in th e past years. It has discovered the main \nreasons for premature skin aging and found new ways  to prevent and fight damage. \nMoreover, cell biologists and biochemists can scien tifically prove the success of treatments \nand document them with modern analysis and evaluati on methods. The aim now is to \noutsmart the skin by smuggling from outside the act ive ingredients and cellular building \nblocks that over time are no longer so abundantly p roduced by the body. The biggest \nchallenge here is transporting these substances int o the subcutaneous tissue where new cells \nare formed. Indeed this is not a path foreseen by n ature since the skin is an excretory \norgan. 1028  \n                                                 \n1027  \u201eSch\u00f6ne glatte Haut\u201c ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 11, 10.05.1989, pp. 48-56, p. 56): \u201e Durch unsere Mimik, die durch \nLachen, Weinen, Sprechen und Stirnrunzeln sichtbar wird, entstehen Falten, die sich \u00fcber Jahre immer t iefer in \ndie Haut eingraben.

Sie hat die Hauptursachen vorzeitiger Hautalte rung 240 \n \n \nA number of points are noteworthy: first of all the  problematic assessment of what \nconstitutes a big step in scientific developments. The second point is the heavy emphasis on \nscientific proof and modern methods. But the third point is by far the most interesting since \noutsmarting nature \u2013by changing the very essence of  the skin\u2013 is explicitly spelt out as the \naim of mainstream cosmetology. This stands in stark  contrast to the natural cosmetics creed, \nnamely the mobilisation of the skin\u2019s own resources  to rebalance itself. Otherwise, the \narticle goes on to detail the various ingredients t hat are packaged into the main \n\u201ctransportation\u201d innovation, i.e. liposomes or nios omes, and provides answers to a number \nof FAQs. A caveat is nevertheless highlighted in th e margin: \u201cThese anti-ageing products are \nnot cheap and are often burdened by enormous R&D co sts. Their composition is variable \ndespite many similarities. Therefore, study the ing redients on the packaging and make sure \nyou get comprehensive advice from your parfumerie.\u201d 1029  This advice sharply contrasts with \nthat to be found in a Frau im Spiegel  article. Even if the latter provides a small gloss ary of the \nmost current active substances, it very pragmatical ly states the following:  \n \nAnti-ageing products usually all contain the same a ctive ingredients, but in different \ncombinations and concentrations. Anyway nowadays ev ery cosmetic product is \ndermatologically tested and manufactured so as to c ause as little irritation as possible. Your \nchoice of cream is mainly a matter of personal tast e. 1030   \n \nApart from these general features, an arresting art icle \u2013in journal form\u2013 unveils the long and \ndubious flirt of a Brigitte  contributor, Barbara de Bernadinis, with a self-im posed treatment \ninvolving highly concentrated Vitamin A. The impetu s to start the treatment is provided by \nan unpleasant realisation: while trying on a low-cu t evening dress, the journalist realises that \nher d\u00e9collet\u00e9 is tanned like old leather after year s of repeated sunburning. 1031  She then opts \nto test a type of dermabrasion using tretinoin, a s pecific Vitamin A extract that is supposed \nto gradually reveal a younger, fresher skin after t riggering a number of scary outbreaks \n(spots, dandruff, blotches, open wounds, etc.). Eve n though this treatment may not seem \nquite as drastic as the \u201cLe Bon\u201d method described e arlier, it nevertheless raises a number of \nscientific and ethical questions, since the journal ist describes her initial crusade to find a \ndermatologist willing to prescribe the highly-conce ntrated version of the cream that is not \navailable over the counter. Despite the serious war nings of specialists, she does not consult \none when her skin starts reacting in a particularly  alarming way: \n \n                                                                                                                                                         \nerkannt und neue Wege gefunden, den Sch\u00e4den vorzube ugen und sie zu bek\u00e4mpfen.

Later I hear from Prof. Raab, that these may  have been the early stages of a malignant \nevolution. My underarms and the inner part of my up per arms (where I never applied \ntretinoin) are covered with red dots, some of them pea-sized. I\u2019m scared. But which \ndermatologist can I consult without being ridiculed ? I should really have consulted a \ndermatologist during the treatment. 1032   \n  \nIn the end, however, the treatment appears to have been successful, nigh miraculous, since \nthe 53-year old experimenter is showered with compl iments on her appearance. To \nconclude, the article displays the rabidness of mea sures some women are willing to put up \nwith in order to regain the youthful self-image tha t westernised society more or less subtly \nimposes upon them. \n \nAnother article in F\u00fcr Sie , not focused on anti-ageing this time, takes a muc h more sensible \ntack on skin problems such as lifeless looking skin , itchy red blotches, dandruff, blackheads, \npimples, little red arteries, small blisters on the  lips, cracks or fissures on the corners of the \nmouth by stating the following: \u201cThere is always a good reason behind skin reaction s such as \npimples or little red arteries. Your body is signal ling that something is out of kilter. If you are \nable to correctly interpret the SOS calls, you can quickly do something about it.\u201d 1033  A feature \nin Brigitte  also reminds its readers that there can be too muc h of a good thing, namely too \nmuch care \u2013thus partially contradicting other conte mporary advice that states that: \u201cThe \nskin does not get habituated to cosmetics in the se nse of getting spoiled or diminishing \neffectiveness. The skin takes what it needs, what i t hungers after.

For example, a F\u00fcr Sie  article on different types of clay \nenjoins it readers to use the effectiveness of natu re for their beauty. It then vaunts the many \nbenefits of this element that can be used in facial , hair or whole-body masks, in creams, \ntoothpastes, shampoos, face and body powders as wel l as talcum powders, not to mention \ninternal use. The most noteworthy characteristic of  these various types of clay is their high \nmineral and trace element content. Their other prop erties include purifying and detoxifying, \nanti-bacterial effects as well as a positive impact  on the moisture metabolism and resistance \nof the skin, of connective tissues and inner organs . 1037    \n \n1990-1992: Natural extracts, high-tech transport an d enviro-stress \nIn the early 1990s, the growing popularity of natur al cosmetics seems to consolidate. Claire \nFisher , for instance, presents an array of ingredients th at will become increasingly popular in \nboth natural and mainstream cosmetics and especiall y in body- or hair care, i.e. aloe vera, \nwheat germ oil, jojoba, or silk protein. 1038  But a new trend seems to have been explicitly \ntaken over from mainstream cosmetics, that of incor porating plants extracts as in e.g. \nClarins \u2019s Cr\u00e8me Hydratante aux extraits de \u2018Cellules Fra\u00eeches \u2019 Phyto-Marines  \u2013an ad that \nreminds one of the aforementioned Monteil  ad for ICE factor 100 . Freshness is ensured by a \ntimely harvest and reminds one of the discourse pro moted in the health food realm, where \ningredients are processed rapidly to retain a maxim um of vitamins and minerals: \u201cApropos, \nthe plants used are processed immediately after the y have been harvested. In this way the \nentire concentrated energy of the active ingredient s is preserved.\u201d 1039  But an even more \nstriking ad is provided by Lierac  under the heading \u201cNature\u2019s strength for your skin \u2013this is \nphyto-cosmetics\u201d :  \n \nIn plain English, at the LIERAC company, phyto-cosm etics means scientific skincare with \nplant-based active ingredient extracts.

By the way \u2013and this is really new in natural cosmetics\u2013 it is not the whole \nplant that is used but only extracts (e.g. from the  flower, the stem or the leaf) that are \neffective to solve a particular problem. 1040   \n \n                                                 \n1036  \u201eSch\u00f6nheitsmasken: Zum Selbermachen f\u00fcr eine glatt e Gesichtshaut\u201c (F\u00fcr Sie, Heft 15, 05.07.1989, p. 7 5). \n1037  \u201cErde hat\u2019s in sich: F\u00fcr Make-up, Haut und Haar\u201c ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 10, 1989, pp. 42-50): \u201e Nutzen Sie die \nWirkung der Natur f\u00fcr Ihre Sch\u00f6nheit\u201c.  \n1038  Ads for Claire Fisher Kosmetik ( Prima , Heft 5, 1990; Brigitte , Heft 4, 1992; F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 21, 1992; F\u00fcr Sie , \nHeft 26, 1992). \n1039  Ad for Clarins Cr\u00e8me Hydratante aux extraits de de  \u201cCellules Fra\u00eeches\u201d Phyto-Marines ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 21, \n1992): \u201e \u00dcbrigens werden die verwendeten Pflanzen unmittelba r nach der Ernte weiterverarbeitet.

Dabei nutzt man \u00fcbrigens \u2013 und das ist \nganz neu in der Naturkosmetik \u2013 nicht die ganze Pfl anze, sondern nur die Extrakte (z.B. von Bl\u00fcte, Ste ngel oder \nBlatt), die f\u00fcr ein Problem wirksam sind.\u201c  243 \n \nHere the emphasis is on schooling consumers to unde rstand the term \u201cphyto-cosmetics\u201d, \nwhich sounds much more sophisticated than \u201cnatural cosmetics\u201d since it is derived from the \nGreek via the French \u2013the use of French being a gua rantor of ultimate know-how and \nglamour in the cosmetic realm. Thus, phyto-cosmetic s, although they can reasonably be \nconceived of as the equivalent of natural cosmetics  (since the latter are also primarily plant-\nbased), is defined as a blend of nature with scient ific expertise. Although there should be a \nclear distinction between cosmetics and pharmacolog y or medicine \u2013as we have discussed it \npreviously, the parentage here is clearly emphasise d. Indeed, it is medicine that lends it \nlegitimacy to the use of specific plants in the cos metics realm. The last sentence though is \npotentially the most controversial one. Arguably, r ecent developments in the realms of cell \nbiology and biotechnology have enabled researchers to further refine extraction techniques \nin order to isolate evermore specific substances bu t the process in general is not as new as \nthe article would have us believe. Natural cosmetic s have long relied on plant extracts \nobtained through various, more or less primitive pr ocedures such as boiling, pressing, \ndistilling, etc. Even \u201csimple\u201d remedies such as her bal teas or ointments are rarely based on \ndecoctions of the whole plant: often they incorpora te only flowers, leaves, roots or extracts \nthereof. Thus when the rest of the text goes on to enumerate the types of extracts used in \nthe cosmetics \u2014 from ivy to camomile, lady\u2019s mantle , horsetail, prunus, calendula and \nruscus, not to mention more exotic plants such as \u201cJioh extract (from China)\u201d ,1041  a plant I \nhave not been able to identify, or \u201cNMF\u201d a mysterio us compound moisturiser we have \nalready encountered in previous years\u2014 it does noth ing more than perpetuate an age-old \ntradition, albeit in a more refined scientific garb . \n \nA similar type of discourse can be found in ads for  Aok . It is reflected on a number of levels. \nThe photograph shows a sophisticated woman with hai r tied back and light but elegant \nmake-up emerging from the \u201ccollar\u201d of an exotic flo wer: a technologically stylised natural \nbeauty. The title states: \u201cThe formula that minimises your wrinkles. Nature p lus liposomes\u201d . \nThe addition of the two suggests that the latter ar e not natural but that this formula is an \nanti-ageing panacea, an impression reinforced by th e logo of the brand \u2013 a strange leaf \nmade up of half a \u201cnatural\u201d leaf and half a diagram  with the following caption: \u201chighly \neffective plant-based care\u201d , echoing the \u201cnaturally effective\u201d motto. 1042  This type of layout is \nreflected in another Aok  ad, showing a pot of cream placed in a similarly e xotic leaf, but \nmuch lower as if it needed protection from the plan t. It thus stresses the caption \u201cthe more \nsensitive your skin, the more it is prone to wrinkl es\u201d . To counter this sensitivity a blend of \nmarshmallow (the plant, NOT the candy), mimosa and so-called \u201cbio-ceramides\u201d is offered in \na cream \u201cwith high effectiveness but without side-effects\u201d .1043  Effectiveness without side-\neffects is a theme that comes up in a new eco-formu lation as can be witnessed in an ad for \nNivea day and night cream. The latter is praised as  follows: \u201cThe night cream with \nmacadamia and sasanqua oils sustainably regenerate my skin\u201d .1044  This represents a step \naway from the alarmist discourse on environmental s tress to offer \u201csustainability\u201d as a \nsolution to a number of environmental problems. In this field, however, it is Weleda that \n                                                 \n1041  Ibid.: \u201eJioh Extrakt (aus China)\u201c.  \n1042  Ad for Aok Aktiv Complex Plus ( prima , Heft 10, 1992): \u201e Die Formel, die Ihre Falten verringert.

Beneath the  rather momentous heading \u201cAs from \ntoday, liposomes are out of date\u201d , Quenty forty  states the following:  \n \n\u25a0Vitamin E currently the best protection against age ing skin. \u25a0Classic liposomes cannot \ntransport vitamin E. \u25a0Therefore Quenty forty has developed the new active  ingredient-\ncourier* that can fulfil this task. \u25a0 It brings vitamin E to the place where skin is bor n. \n(*Composed of phytantriol and vitamin E.) 1046  \n \nThis cream is thus a good example of the cosmetic d evelopments described in an afore-\ndiscussed article in prima,  which saw the main challenge as finding an appropr iate carrier to \nbring necessary substances to the \u201csubcutaneous tissue where new cells are formed\u201d .1047  In \nkeeping with its name, Marbert \u2019s Profutura  cream is described as using other vehicules to \ntransport vitamin A and E, so called \u201cnanoparts\u201d .1048  This represents the first allusion to \nnanotechnology in the cosmetics realm, but no speci fic technical details are provided here. \nOther brands, while using other names, are more exp licit as to the function of these micro-\ncarriers. Heliotrop Activ , for instance, contains yet another magic combinat ion, whereby the \n\u201cnanoparts\u201d seem to have been replaced by so-called  \u201cultraparts\u201d: \u201cLiposomes plus \nultraparts are natural micro-globules from soy plan t derived lecithin: they represent the \noptimal association of two biologically active ingr edient transport systems. The skin is thus \nprovided with in-depth moisturisation and precious natural materials.\u201d 1049   \n \nOther companies extol seemingly much more complex s tructures under such evocative \nnames as Capture  or Ic\u00f4ne  (Christian Dior ), Initiator  (Y ves Saint Laurent ), Authentique  (Payot ) \nor Immunage  (Elizabeth Arden ).

In a much longer description of the  Capture  and Ic\u00f4ne  creams, we read that \nwhat distinguishes Ic\u00f4ne  \u2013as a guarantor of holy perfection\u2013 from other cre ams is that it \ncontains an exclusive \u201cbiological active ingredient orthokeraten [sic?] \u201d that \u201cgives  back to \nthe epidermis all the attributes of normal skin\u201d .1052  On the face of it, the name \n\u201corthokeraten\u201d may imply that this ingredient can p rovide the type of corrective treatment \nfor the skin that orthopedics provides for bones an d joints. 1053  Yves Saint Laurent  with its sci-\nfi sounding Initiator  programme draws a \u201cground-breaking\u201d conclusion: \u201cThe source of all \nbeauty is \u2013 life\u201d . And this life is enabled by so-called initiators which are \u201cbiologically active \nsubstances that are identical to the essential raw materials that are naturally present in the \nskin\u201d .1054  Another ad for the same line goes on to describe t he function of what sounds like \nan army of little robots: \u201cEvery single initiator has a very specific functio n: the initiator \nresponsible for oxygen supply lends the skin its gl ow, the moisturising initiator improves its \nability to retain moisture. The regeneration and re vitalisation initiators ensure a youthful \nappearance.\u201d  Further on, under the still rather dissonant headi ng \u201cPleasure and beauty \nthrough high-tech textures\u201d,  the text explains that:  \n \nInnovative, patented textures were developed so as to ensure an immediate penetration and \ndistribution of the active substances. These refres hing and smooth micro-crystal emulsions, \nwhich are composed of millions of minute droplets s maller than liposomes have an ideal \npenetration potential and are immediately absorbed by the skin. Daily care thus becomes an \nunforgettable experience. 1055  \n \nThis is a good example of how technology is increas ingly being harnessed to foster a \nsensuous experience. In terms of structure, Payot  also boasts the use of crystals: \u201cThe \nAuthentique complex embodies the newest scientific discoveries of biotechnology. The \noriginal liquid crystals system ensures bio-availab ility: the active substances are released \naccording to the needs of the epidermis, they penet rate better with optimal \n                                                 \n1051  Cf. http://www.pasteur.fr/ip/easysite/pasteur/en/instit ut-pasteur .

The amazing thing \nis that its effect is absolutely similar to the nat ural function of the skin. Tests conducted at \nthe \u201cINSERM\u201d institute have proved it.  1057  \n \nHere again, a company has recourse to a mysterious alga, extracts from it a miracle molecule \nthat by chance mimics the skin function \u2013and the la tter is confirmed by yet another \nprestigious scientific institution. 1058  Time and a miracle molecule (so-called Cyclan\u2122) ar e also \nthe two mainstays of Revlon \u2019s publicity for Evivesse  a \u201cskin rescheduling cream - cr\u00e8me de \nrecyclage\u201d  that claims it can confer a younger rhythm to skin .

This introduction \nshould thus prepare the reader to get the full meas ure of the exploit performed by Lanc\u00f4me  \nresearchers who \u201cfor the first time have been able to perfectly imi tate skin lipids. The lipid \nmicrospheres in the new Nios\u00f4me+ system now perfect ly match those of the skin, not just \nmolecules with a single chain but very different mo lecules with 1, 2 and 3 chains.\u201d  1060   \n \nCompared to these dithyrambic assessments of scient ific achievement, publicity for frei \u00f6l  \npresents a much more down-to-earth and slightly iro nic perspective:  \n \nThe international beauty scene is seething. Thousan ds of laboratories across the world are \nsearching for the ultimate beauty secrets. An incre asing number of high-tech creams promise \nwomen and men an attractive appearance over a longe r period of time as well as a touch of \neternal youth. Increasingly complicated and exotic formulations emerge on the market and \ntackle our stressed and exhausted skin with ever no vel active substances. However the effect \nof many of these substances praised as silver bulle ts against ageing skin is often contested \nwithin dermatological circles.  1061   \n \nThe ad concludes that the only substances that seem  to earn the approbation of \ninternational skin specialists are vitamins, expeci ally vitamins A and E. In keeping with the \nmatter-of-fact tone of the introduction, the ad doe s not waste much effort in providing \n(pseudo-)scientific explanations about their dermat ological functions since it simply states \nthat \u201cThese little jack-of-all-trades are indispensable secret helpers in everyday beauty care \nsince, in a sense, they rebuild the skin from the i nside\u201d .1062  However, it cannot help \nmentioning the substantial proofs obtained by means  of scientific studies conducted in \nAmerican and German university dermatological clini cs \u2013whereby the frequent use of frei \u00f6l \nis supposed to accelerate skin renewal.  \n \nIn terms of environmental stress, the discourse is becoming more and more fanatical to the \npoint of aping conspiracy theories. To wit, an ad f or Clarins \u2019s Multi-Active Jour face cream \ndescribes the following scary scenario:  \n \nDestructive forces are tirelessly at work, from mor ning till evening: the harmful UV rays, the \ndry atmosphere at the office, the big temperature d ifferences between inside and out, the \n                                                 \n1060  Ibid.: \u201eZum ersten Mal konnten die hauteigenen Lipide perf ekt nachgebildet werden.

Indirectly, it is \nthe late modern, urban lifestyle that is being indi cted here, since the ad hints at the harm \ncaused by modern insulation, air-conditioning and t raffic. Other companies are more \nscientifically specific in their condemnation. RoC , for instance, denounces the \u201cdisintegration \nof the supportive connective tissue through enzymes  hostile to the skin\u201d  as the main \nculprit. 1065  The ultimate enemies against which Elizabeth Arden \u2019s Immunage UV \nSchutzsystem  is wrestling are free radicals: \u201cLight is primarily responsible for the ageing of \nthe skin \u2013 not biological ageing. Dermatologists ha ve confirmed it. The skin is constantly \nexposed to harmful light rays: outside, in closed r ooms, even under artificial light\u201d .1066  Hence \nthe enemy here is not even man-made. Nevertheless, its ubiquitousness is bound to instil a \nform of protective paranoia reflected in the pictur e featuring an elegant woman with a \n1950s hairdo and a scarf wrapped around her head, w earing futuristic-looking \u201cblack-mirror\u201d \nsunglasses. \n \nThe contrast between the sophistication and threate ning tenor of these bellicose discourses \nand the no-frills statements of Lian  or Nivea  could hardly be greater. Indeed, with the \npicture of a young woman sitting in a car against a  bigger illustration showing an \nenlargement of half her face, Lian soberly states:  \u201cLian ... I\u2019ve tried it and I\u2019m convinced. \nWithin just a few days, Lian perceptibly smoothes t he texture of the skin\u201d .1067  An ad for Nivea  \nis even more radically laconic since beside the ill ustration showing a pretty young woman \nemerging from a bed cover, the caption says \u201cSimply beautiful\u201d  together with the Nivea \nmotto \u201cEssential for the skin\u201d .1068  \n \nOtherwise, products for sensitive skins are still a  strong presence on the market, with e.g. \nproducts from Oil of Olaz , Babor  or Penaten . Ads for the latter are probably the most \nrepresentative. Against a background showing a youn g woman in a bathrobe, the caption \nechoes the straightforward simplicity of the afore- quoted Lian and Nivea  ads: \u201cI want \nnothing that my skin does not tolerate. I want ever ything that my skin needs\u201d . The text goes \non to emphasise a purity discourse while also indic ting both the (man-made) environment \nand harmful rays:  \n \n                                                 \n1063  Ad for Clarins Multi-Active Jour ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 25, 1992): \u201e Unerm\u00fcdlich, von morgens bis abends, sind \nzerst\u00f6rerische Kr\u00e4fte am Werk: Die sch\u00e4dlichen UV-S trahlen, das trockene Klima im B\u00fcro, die gro\u00dfen \nTemperatur-Unterschiede zwischen drinnen und drau\u00dfe n, die Schadstoffe in der Luft: All das greift Ihre  Haut \npausenlos an.

It is free of \ncolourings and preservatives. And when nothing irri tates the skin, the active caring \nsubstances are a lot more effective. Sensitive skin  is thus actively cared for and reliably \nprotected from harmful environmental and light infl uences.  1069  \n \nAfter the first early 1980s breakthrough, purity is  also echoed in a \u201cgel texture\u201d revival, with \na plethora of products from e.g. Nivea \u2019s Augen Make-up Entferner Gel , to Shiseido \u2019s Vital-\nPerfection Daily Eye Primer , Oil of Olaz \u2019s Hydro-Gel-Linie , Ellen Betrix \u2019s Aqua Care  line or \nbebe \u2019s Hydro-Gel. 1070  A feature article in prima  praises the fact that gels do not contain fat \n(as an echo of contemporary dietary requirements?),  are rapidly absorbed by the skin, hence \neconomical, and do not require emulsifiers, which m eans they are less likely to cause \nallergies. Moreover, they are full of active substa nces such as hyaluronic acid, collagen, aloe \nvera, panthenol or vitamin A. The article recommend s them especially for women with oily \nor mixed skin or young and/or sensitive skins. An a dditional blurb provides a short 2-\nquestion interview with the scientific manager of t he Ellen Betrix  dermatological-\ncosmetological laboratory. Dr Magdalene Hubbuch exp lains that the new generation of gels \nare in fact hydro-gels containing a large amount of  water: \u201cFrom a chemical perspective, they \ncontain so-called scaffolding components. These can  be natural products such as proteins, \npectins or algae but often they are artificially ma nufactured substances that are called \npolymers.\u201d  Their refreshing or cooling effect is due to these  polymers: \u201cThese are chemical \ncompounds characterised by long molecular chains. O ne can picture them as millipedes \nbearing a bucket of water on each leg, which is how  they can absorb up to 95 percent \nmoisture.\u201d  1071   \n \nDuring these years, one can find a number of skin-r elated feature articles that discuss \nanything from the impact of care and lifestyle, to sensitive or impure skin, new anti-ageing \nstrategies, eye care, appropriate cleansing, how to  care for the skin after the summer \nholidays, or how to look glowing in 15 minutes in o rder to face a spontaneous invitation. The \nmost noteworthy common denominator in these article s is a heightened emphasis on the \ninfluence of lifestyle, diet and stress on the skin .  \n \nFor instance, an emblematic article in Brigitte  on what the skin betrays starts off with a \nwarning against junk food: \u201cAs a rule, a trained beautician can detect at firs t glance whether \nsomeone eats mostly salad and wholemeal products or  if Coca-Cola and chips are menu \nstaples.\u201d 1072  The feature goes on to indict two further culprits,  namely alcohol and cigarettes \n                                                 \n1069  Ad for Penaten PurAktiv ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 22, 1992 or Brigitte , Heft 22, 1992): \u201e Ich will nichts, was meine Haut \nnicht vertr\u00e4gt.

The only solution \nforeseen is to avoid both, or at the very least dim inish one\u2019s intake. The last offender \ndescribed in the article is nervosity or stress \u201cthat is literally written all over many \nindividuals\u2019 foreheads\u201d , before quoting the example of a young woman who s uffered from \natypical acne for years until she left her boyfrien d... The physiological effects of stress are \nanalysed in terms of constricted blood vessels that  impede the disposal of waste products, \nleading to the skin\u2019s \u201csurly\u201d  reaction. 1073  The remedy recommended is frequent relaxation, \nincluding slower and deeper breathing in stressful situations. Finally, the article closes with \nan exercise designed to train abdominal breathing.  \n \nAnother emerging concern is a new distrust in the s un \u2013not only on holiday but also on the \nhome front. Thus an article in prima warns readers about the protracted dangers of UV ra ys \nthat lead to premature ageing. There again, one sen ses the type of paranoia I have discussed \nin the previous sections on environmental stress, s ince it is emphasized that these rays are \nactive even when the sky is grey as well as indoors  and when using artificial lights. This then \nexplains the growing selection of day or moisturisi ng creams that contain UV-filters as well \nas vitamins A and E, supposed to strengthen the ski n\u2019s defense mechanisms. For those who \ncannot renounce sun worship, the article recommends  the new generation of self-tanning \nlotions \u201cwhose only commonality with the old self-bronzers is a skin-friendly substance \n(dihydroxyacetone, abridged as DHA) that tans the h orny layer of the skin. Their novelty lies \nin the fact that they also provide care as well as UV-filters against the sun.\u201d 1074   \n \nAnother crucial recognition, discussed in a prima  article, is the importance of preserving the \nskin\u2019s acid balance and avoiding harsh soaps as wel l as overintense cleansing so as not to \nendanger it. In the coming years, this will become a leitmotiv in advertising for syndets [i.e. \nsynthetic detergents as opposed to conventional soa ps] that are supposed to be less \naggressive towards the skin. The feature begins by explaining the meaning of pH-value and \ndescribes the acid mantle protecting the skin befor e emphasising that mild products should \nemulate the skin\u2019s naturally acidic pH that lies be tween 5 and 6. 1075   \n \nFinally, there are three feature articles in prima  \u2013designed to clarify scientific terminology to \ndebunk cosmetological myths as well as present test ing procedures\u2013 that are worth \ndiscussing. They are designed to enlighten readers in a field often riddled with esoteric-\nsounding nomenclature as well as highly complex hig h-tech processes \u2013which are rarely \nfactually explained since advertising tends to osci llate between the extremes of bombast \nand secrecy\u2013 and to clarify the tensions between po pular expertise on the skin and rapidly \nevolving scientific knowledge.  \n \nThe first feature, significantly entitled \u201cWhat on earth is \u2018butylhydroxianisole\u2019?\u201d  attempts to \nsum the then current debate pertaining to ingredien t lists on cosmetic products. It begins by \n                                                                                                                                                         \nVollkornprodukten ern\u00e4hrt oder Coca-Cola und Pommes  frites ganz oben auf dem Speisezettel stehen, das kann \neine geschulte Kosmetikerin meist schon auf den ers ten Blick erkennen.\u201c \n1073  Ibid., p. 74:  \u201edas steht manchem buchst\u00e4blich auf der Stirn gesc hrieben.\u201c; \u201eunwirsch\u201c;  \n1074  \u201eWenn Ihre Haut nach dem Urlaub urlaubsreif ist\u201c ( prima , Heft 9, 1990): \u201e Selbstbr\u00e4uner der neuen \nGeneration sind jetzt der Geheimtip Nr. 1!

However a \ngrowing number of producers are yielding to the lab elling trend of at least naming the types \nof preservatives contained in their products since so many consumers are allergic. The article \nalso mentions an EU-commission supposed to elaborat e a set of cosmetic regulations. It \ngoes on to add that German producers follow the Nor th American example by having \nrecourse to the system developed by the Cosmetic, T oiletry and Fragrance Association \n(CTFA). 1076  But it emphasises that despite the obvious advanta ges of drawing on a successful \nlabelling system, German consumers may be linguisti cally discriminated by the use of English \nchemical terminology. However a closer analysis rev eals that this is just a superficial problem \nand that the real crunch for consumers is to actual ly understand terms such as \n\u201cbutylhydroxianisole\u201d \u2013which is apparently quite a common preservative. The article thus \nrecommends contacting producers who often have Germ an-speaking brochures, tables and \nlists of ingredients and explanations for intereste d consumers or dermatologists. Finally the \nfeature ends up listing a number of strategies init iated by producers to avoid or limit the use \nof preservatives: e.g. especially fine water in oil  emulsions, aseptic manufacturing and sterile \npackaging in airtight containers, small quantities packed in aluminium tubes, etc. 1077  Due to \nincreasing allergy concerns, this is an issue that will increasingly resonate in the following \nyears. \n \nThe next article  \u201cWere you aware of it? Here you can test your cosm etic knowledge! What is \nprejudiced, now obsolete or actual fact?\u201d  provides an interesting contrast since instead of \nfocusing on scientific knowledge in order to vulgar ise it, it aims to help readers assess the \nvalidity of popular wisdom by listing the most comm on assumptions about cosmetics before \ndenouncing or mitigating them. Assumptions range fr om the need to regularly change \ncosmetics to avoid tiring the skin, avoiding chocol ate, fatty meat cuts and spices in the case \nof acne, cleansing the skin only if one has used ma ke-up, eating vitamins instead of applying \nthem externally, etc. 1078  \n    \nFinally, under the heading \u201cNews from the laboratory\u201d , the title of the next article \ntriumphantly proclaims that \u201cCosmetics are effective: it can be proved!\u201d .1079  It then describes \nthe tests required to quantify preservability (whic h is fixed at the legal minimum of 30 \nmonths) \u2013including extreme temperature differences and a so-called \u201cshaker\u201d test. It also \ndetails voluntary tests to prove effectiveness, e.g . profilometry involving a before and after \nmolding of the skin to assess whether wrinkles have  diminished, coxelography, a type of \nvideo surveillance for the complexion or, more pros aically, plasters to measure the \nproduction of sebum on the surface of the skin. And  last but not least, it mentions the \nallergy tests that are often carried out on a large  scale by the biggest producers. At the end \nof each section, consumer advantages are then empha sised: freshness, effectiveness and \nhigh tolerance \u2013since cosmetics apparently account for only 1% of all allergies.  \n                                                 \n1076  Compulsory cosmetic labelling according to the INC I system was enforced later, i.e. as from Jan. 1 st  1997. \nCf. earlier discussion. In 1997, the CTFA became th e Personal Care Products Council, cf.: \nhttp://www.ctfa.org/ctfa-becomes-personal-care-prod ucts-council  [websiste accessed Aug. 2011]. \n1077  \u201eWas, bitte ist \u201aButylhydroxianisol\u2018?\u201c ( prima , Heft 7, 1990, p. 48).   \n1078  \u201eH\u00e4tten Sie es gewu\u00dft?

However, even if so-called contact allergies \u2013the most \nfrequent manifestation of cosmetic allergies\u2013 are o ften quoted as a significant type of \nallergy, 1080  it is quite challenging to obtain reliable statist ics. There seems to be a number of \nreasons for this: from the tension between the popu lar and scientific definitions of allergy or \nintolerance, to varying categorisations of allergie s, cross-allergies, diagnostic challenges, \nindividual perception, etc. 1081  Furthermore even when considering a single categor y such as \n\u201ccontact allergies\u201d, not all these allergies can be  traced back to cosmetic ingredients, far \nfrom it. If one leaves aside latex (which is often treated as a separate allergy category \ndespite its being primarily a contact allergy) it i s the metal nickel that heads the list (17.2%), \nfollowed \u2013way back\u2013 by fragrances (7.2%), Peruvian balsam (6.7%), etc. Even relatively \ncommon cosmetic ingredients actually account for a very small percentage of contact \nallergies, e.g. lanolin alcohol (2.9%). 1082  Thus, even if the figure quoted by the afore-\nmentioned article can potentially be challenged, it  is still safe to say that, contrary to popular \nperception, cosmetic allergies are on the whole sti ll rather uncommon.    \n \n1995-2000: Actively techno-natural \nIn the second half of the decade, naturally-oriente d cosmetics still represents a strong niche \nmarket that gradually incorporates some of the tren ds of mainstream cosmetics \u2013e.g. \nsegmented care for younger and older skin, specific  ingredients such as vitamins or alpha-\nhydroxy acids (AHAs) and vehicles such as liposomes  or so called nanosomes\u2013 whilst \npursuing their own path with e.g. attention to spec ific fatty acids or green tea. 1083  A new \ntheme is an added attention not only to the well-be ing of the skin but also to that of the \nenvironement, as thematised in an ad for Apotheker Scheller  products: \u201cIt is exclusively \nbased on gently extracted natural ingredients, whic h irritate neither the skin nor the \n                                                 \n1080  According to e.g.  the \u201eAktionsplan gegen Allergien\u201c  website by the Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrung, \nLandwirtschaft und Verbraucherschutz: http://www.aktionsplan-\nallergien.de/cln_162/nn_461368/SharedDocs/Downloads /10__Forschung__Wissen/Statistik__Allergiker.html , \nin 2008, about 7% of the German population suffers from contact allergies, compared to e.g. respirator y \nallergies (30%), food allergies and intolerances (6 %), insect poisons (2.5%), drug allergies (10%), ne urodermitis \n(3%) and hayfever (12%), statistics published on 05 .02.2008, source: ga 2len Global Allergy and Asthma \nEuropean Network.

But the most decisive \ndevelopment is a much more marked attention to the holistic management of the body: \n\u201cFeeling well is the best care. A beautiful smooth skin and a radiant appearance are a matter \nof individual responsibility. Fitness, a healthy di et and a dash of enthusiasm are part of it, as \nis gentle care. \u201d 1085  A similar type of discourse can be witnessed in an  ad for Yves Rocher \u2019s \nBeaut\u00e9 Nature  line foregrounding a feisty young woman riding her  bike in a natural, forest-\nlike setting (the outline of her male companion can  just be distinguished in the background): \n\u201cWe want to really feel good in our skin. Therefore  we have consciously decided to live \nnaturally. And that is how we want to care for ours elves as well.\u201d 1086  Well-feeling/being thus \nappears to be an endeavour requiring a new holistic  consciousness of and responsibility for \nthe self in its many facets as well as the natural environment. \n \nIn the mainstream cosmetics field, there seems to b e a gradual blurring of boundaries \nbetween high tech and nature, even if techno-intens ive discourse has by no means died out, \nas emblematised by a Dior  ad for Capture  that trumpets \u201cScience\u2019s new victory over time\u201d \nwith its pure micro-protein (developed together wit h the Institut Europ\u00e9en de Biologie \nCellulaire , as a scientific guarantor) that \u201crevitalises the vital cellular functions\u201d  (as \ndocumented by in vitro testing \u2013 the proof obsessio n once again...). 1087  A similar type of \ndiscourse is propounded by Helena Rubinstein  in an ad for Face Sculpture \u201cwith pro-\nphosphor\u201d . The product promises \u201csmoother facial contours \u2018without surgery\u2019\u201d , while the \nrest of the text hastens to add \u201ca cream is no substitute for a facelift but an int ensive \ntreatment with Face Sculptor Serum plus Face Sculpt or Cr\u00e8me closely resembles this \nintervention\u201d . The discourse around these products seems to triv ialise the recourse to \ncosmetic surgery and indirectly endorses a very inv asive and controversial procedure. In a \nsense, the message appears to be: \u201cIf you cannot af ford the time or the money for a facelift \nor if you still have reservations about it but stil l care deeply about your appearance, Face \nSculptor  is a good substitute\u201d. One can also note that Helena Rubinstein  seems to be yielding \nto the \u201cmore transparency\u201d trend initiated by some producers (as noted in the previously \ndiscussed feature article) since it lists some of t he main ingredients in its products, e.g. for \ninstance : \u201cwith pro-phosphor, modelling active ingredients (30%), caffeine\u201d  for the \nConcentrated Line Lift Serum . However, in this case, the bluff remains since it  is unlikely that \nthe average consumer will be able to associate any concretely relevant properties with pro-\nphosphor, 1088  not to mention the humbug involved in the designat ion \u201cmodelling active \n                                                 \n1084  Ibid.: \u201e Sie basiert auschliesslich auf schonend gewonnenen Naturstoffen, die weder Haut noch Umwelt \nreizen.\u201c  \n1085  Ibid.: \u201e Sich wohlf\u00fchlen ist die beste Pflege.

As a result \nthe skin is instantly firmed and lifted\u2019.\u201d  [website accessed Aug. 2011] 254 \n \ningredients\u201d  that could cover just about anything. Nevertheless , the ad does contain the first \n(footnoted!) specification or disclaimer for moistu rising substances that I have found. They \nare described as effective only \u201cin the upper layers of the epidermis\u201d , thus mitigating the in-\ndepth effect that is implied by the \u201cfacelift\u201d comp arison and that is vaunted by most \ncosmetic companies. 1089   \n \nBut most mainstream companies promote a blend of \u201cn atural\u201d and \u201ctechnological\u201d \ningredients to support the skin\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d regener ation or protection. Pond\u2019s , for instance, \nadvertises a Hydro-Aufbau Cr\u00e8me  that blends the \u201cevening primrose oil\u201d natural hit  with \nliposomes and \u201cprotective\u201d Vitamin E. 1090  Other companies seem to more self-consciously \ndraw on a natural- high-tech repertoire, with a ter minology that is just as opaque and \nmystifying as the high-tech discourse we have witne ssed until now. A good example is \nprovided by Sans Soucis  who trumpets: \u201cThere is a world novelty from Nature in Repair \nEnergy: Biocell.\u201d  The illustration shows the face of a young woman ( ecstatically or sleepily?) \nupturned towards a lily flower but the text seems t o purposefully retain the initial ambiguity: \n\u201cBiocell is a unique new active ingredient from the  most precious plant in the world\u201d. 1091  \nBiotherm  also seems to enjoy using the \u201cbio\u201d prefix not jus t in its brand name but also in its \nBiojeunesse  line that contains \u201cPlancton Thermal Biotechnologique\u2122 [sic!], the con centrated \nactive ingredient found in hot springs [that] natur ally activates the skin\u2019s functions\u201d . French \nchic seems to be at work again, since not translati ng the name of the active ingredient ads a \nlayer of mystification to what may already appear a s a strange collocation: a natural \ningredient but in \u201cbiotechnological quality\u201d. Consu mers are left in the dark as to what \nexactly \u201cbiotechnologique\u201d  refers to in this particular case. Instead the epi thet simply \nfunctions as a guarantor of scientific credibility,  but a credibility that should nevertheless \nenable the obtention of \u201ca skin that gives you pleasure\u201d . Thus nature, technology and \npleasure seem to be reunited in the pursuit of the same cosmetic goal. 1092  \n  \nOtherwise, during these years mainstream cosmetics present a festival of active substances \n\u2013both \u201cnatural\u201d and synthetic. Some of them seem pa rticularly enduring such as vitamins, \nliposomes or thymus extract. Vitamins as antioxidan ts to combat free radicals are actually \none of the enduring hits: from \u201ccocktails\u201d such as the one presented by Elizabeth Arden \u2019s \nSpa line with vitamins A, C and E (as well as minerals)1093  to Lanc\u00f4me \u2019s Vitabolic  gel (with \nactive vitamin C, ginseng and gingko) 1094  or more puristic products such as L\u2019Or\u00e9al \u2019s Futur\u2022e  \nwith pure vitamin E: \u201cEvery day, thanks to its unique technology (patent ed micro-capsules) \n                                                 \n1089  Ad for Helena Rubinstein Face Sculptor line ( Brigitte , Heft 2, 1998): \u201eMit Pro-Phosphor\u201c ; \u201e Ebenm\u00e4ssigere \nGesichtskonturen \u201aohne Chirurgie\u2018\u201c;  \u201eEine Cr\u00e8me ersetzt kein Lifting.

Somet imes they are blended with other \nsubstances to protect the sensitised skin. 1100  Finally Biotherm \u2019s Hydra-Detox  banks on a \n\u201cnew\u201d process rather than a magic substance since i t declares that \u201cMoisturising alone is not \nenough.

These practices are often rooted in traditio nal medical systems such as Ayurveda and its Pancha karma \nprocedures, as defined e.g. by the Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha (Department of AYUSH, \nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of Ind ia): \u201cPanchakarma means the \"five therapies\"/five \ntherapeutic means of eliminating toxins from the bo dy are Vaman (emesis), Virechan (purgation), Nasya (nasal \ninsufflation), Basti  (enema) and Raktamoskshana  (blood-letting by using leech and different instru ments).

However, there are a number of critical \n(contemporary) voices raised against what is percei ved as pure quackery, especially as it pertains to \ncommercial detox products: cf. e.g.  http://www.skepdic.com/detox.html  (including a number of references); \nThe Detox Dossier , Eds Alice Tuff & Harriet Ball, 2009, online publi cation: \nhttp://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/PDF/Detox%20Dos sier.pdf ; Prasad, Aarathi, \u201cChampneys detox patches \ndraw out harmful toxins from your body overnight\u201d,  There Goes the Science Bit: a guide to standing up for \nscience for early career researchers , Eds Alice Tuff & Frank Swain, London: Sense about  Science, online 256 \n \n \nProducts for sensitive skin remain a strong niche m arket with new products designed to \ndesensitise skin. The talk here is mainly centered around the term \u201csensitivity\u201d or \u201cirritation \nthreshold\u201d [Reizschwelle] but there seems to be som e linguistic confusion: whereas Payot \u2019s \nLes Sensitives  suggest that \u201cThe sensitivity threshold of your skin diminishes by up to 75% and \nredness is significantly reduced\u201d ,1103  Vichy \u2019s SenSium  contends that its products enable an \n\u201cincrease of the sensitivity threshold thanks to sk in-regulating care: 94% less irritation after 4 \nweeks\u201d .1104  However both products have recourse to \u201cnatural\u201d i ngredients: epaline 1105  and \nliquorice extracts for Payot  and alginates, a natural polymer, 1106  for Vichy . Whereas all are \ncharacterised as soothing, the latter is described as a second skin in surgery because it \ncontributes to wound healing, is hypoallergenic and  contributes to protection from free \nradicals and drying. 1107  Interestingly though, an earlier ad for Payot  presents a more positive \nperspective on sensitive skin, presenting it as an asset. The cream by mitigating the \nsensitivity of the skin is seen as contributing to the blossoming of its specific beauty: \u201cThus \nmy delicateness has become my trump card and I am v ery sensitive to that.\u201d 1108  \n \nA relatively new niche in terms of skin protection is represented by products initially \nstemming from soap and body lotion research, i.e. a  series of pH-neutral or rather skin-\nneutral brands. Early ads stress similar characteri stics to those found in previous body-care \nproducts, i.e. a specific attention to the protecti on or restoration of the skin\u2019s acidic \nprotection, the so-called \u201cacid mantle\u201d, sometimes with the addition of other skin friendly \nsubstances such as e.g. vitamin E or dexpanthenol 1109  \u2013an effect reinforced by an illustration \n                                                                                                                                                         \npublication, 2007, http://www.senseaboutscience.org/data/files/resourc es/15/There-Goes-the-Science-Bit.pdf , \npp. 6-7.

All the ads I have collected in this ser ies stem from the lifestyle magazine Bunte  \nthat seems to boast a slightly older readership tha n the likes of Brigitte  or F\u00fcr Sie . Actress \nHannelore Elsner stars in an ad for Marbert \u2019s  Cell Activation  in a glamourous and flatteringly \nblurred photo under the caption \u201cWhy should my skin look older than I actally feel? \u201d .

This is the wa y many women feel nowadays\u201d .1112  A very \nsimilar discourse is peddled by Oil of Olaz  who presents an older but just as carefully \ngroomed and radiant woman with the following affirm ation: \u201cMy skin should look as good as \nI feel\u201d .1113  Finally, a (seemingly prematurely) white-haired wo man with a dazzling smile is the \nicon of Nivea \u2019s Vital  line that is supposed to provide \u201cnew vitality to mature skin every day\u201d . \nIn all these creams, vitamins (A, B5, C or E) play a central role. 1114  \n \nA new product on the market is Imedeen , a skin-specific food supplement including \u201cmarine \nbiological proteins, polysaccharides, vitamin C and  zink\u201d . The campaign for Imedeen  mainly \nstars Ann Archer \u2013an American actress in her late f orties\u2013 as well as a series of anonymous \nconsumers. The common denominator of all the ads is  an emphasis on the effects of an \nunbalanced lifestyle, e.g.: \u201cStress, too little movement, an unbalanced diet ma ke the skin \nappear sallow and grey\u201d . If outer cosmetics are recognised as providing a valuable \ncontribution to the youth and beauty of the skin, i ts limits are also stressed: \u201cLasting success \ncan only be obtained by additional nourishment from  the inside\u201d .1115  Hence, this represents \nan implicit recognition that holistic measures are necessary to ensure effective wrinkle \nprevention\u2026    \n \nAmong a number of relatively new strategies to figh t acne or impure skin, an article in \nBrigitte  presents another technological novelty: an array o f plasters to prevent or cure nasty \nspots, pimples and blackheads.

Finally, the article emphasises a new \nphenomenon, so-called late acne that seems to be pl aguing an increasing number of 30-year \nolds. The causes remain unclear, but stress or horm onal imbalances linked to the intake of \nthe pill are viewed as plausible. 1116    \n \nOn another note, after establishing itself as a cha mpion of laconically effective publicity \u2013in \nline with the simplicity of its traditional Nivea Cr\u00e8me \u2013 Nivea  inaugurates a novel strategy, \nthat of emotional advertising, a phenomenon that wi ll gather impetus well into the next \ncentury. A famous ad for its cream shows a little g irl hugging her mother and the photograph \nis stamped with a huge caption that states \u201cMother\u201d  in a massive font and \u201cLove\u201d  in a much \nlighter and rounder fount. At the bottom of the ad,  once can read the usual caption \n\u201cEssential for the skin \u201d alongside a tin of cream. 1117  As in ads for other, non-body oriented \ntechnologies, this type of ad suggests that technol ogy is just an empty vehicle if it is not \npowered by the force of positive (and, in this case , nurturing) emotion. 1118   \n \nMany of the findings that have emerged in the cours e of my analysis of publicity are \nreflected in the feature articles of the time, most  prominently in a recapitulative article in \nBrigitte  entitled \u201cSkincare report: This is new\u201d . The article sums up \u201cnovelties\u201d such as the \nrenewed focus on vitamins, especially vitamin C, wh ich poses a particular challenge because \nit is difficult to stabilise. Companies seem to hav e elaborated various solutions: from a last \nminute blending of powdered vitamin with gel, to ot her forms of extraction or preservation \nwith alcohol. But all vitamins are recommended sinc e they help combat free radicals, \nbalance skin moisture levels as well as encourage t he skin\u2019s self-regeneration: \u201cThus vitamins \nare a cosmetic evergreen and especially when combin ed, they are unbeatable: be it against \nwrinkles, dryness or irritation\u201d . The article also notes the emergence of ads for \u201c mature\u201d skin \nand reports the hullabaloo set off by Clinique  when it first advertised that \u201cBeautiful does \nnot mean young\u201d , before other companies jumped onto the bandwagon:  \u201caccording to \nstatistics every other woman who regularly uses cre am is over 50. The cosmetics industry has \nadapted to this fact and no longer perceives mature  skin as a problem\u201d. Which means that a \nseries of products have been launched that are \u201cno longer abashedly presented as \u2018creams \nfor stressed, damaged or very dry skin\u2019\u201d . Instead simple, straightforward care is the new \nmotto: \u201cWomen who are at peace with their age have a reali stic outlook and do not expect \nmiracles.

The fourth and final sect ion of the feature reports on the \nsomewhat confusing situation regarding animal testi ng. Attempts to introduce a rapid \nanimal-testing standstill failed in 1993 but a law is planned for the future: \u201cAll animal-testing \nwill be banned as of 1998 but only if until then, a cceptable alternatives are found\u201d .1121  And \nthat is precisely the crux of the debate, because i f in- vitro testing and skin modelling using \ncell-cultures are increasingly becoming the norm, a nd if animal-testing is no longer carried \nout for a number of regular products such as shampo o or straightforward creams, experts \nare divided about the necessity to carry on with an imal-testing in order to chart the long-\nterm genetic impact of specific substances. The art icle closes with the mention of the \n\u201cproduced without animal testing\u201d  seal, which remains controversial since most subst ances \nhave originally been tested on animals. 1122  \n \nBesides also mentioning animal-testing regulations,  a 1997 article in Focus  reports on the \nimpending European laws pertaining to the cosmetic market: \u201cIn future, the effectiveness of \na product must be proven. Moreover, what should hav e been the norm a long time ago, will \nat last become a law: cosmetics, when used appropri ately should not harm anyone, the \ningredients should be stated and the use-by date pr ovided\u201d . Thus the burden of proof rests \nwith the producers instead of the consumers. But ma ny voices \u2013especially from the \necological faction\u2013 have raised concerns about the opacity of some chemical jargon that may \nmask potentially harmful substances such as carcino genic preservatives. Other voices \ncriticise the fact that some umbrella terms such as  \u201cfragrance\u201d may mask dangerous \nsubstances such as \u201cnerve-damaging nitromusk compounds\u201d .

It describes voluntary efforts by a number of companies \u2013both natural and \nmainstream\u2013 to limit the number of ingredients (hen ce potential allergens) in some of their \nproducts and it details packaging strategies to lim it or avoid preservatives. 1124  A later feature \nin the same magazine is designed to help women with  very sensitive skins find appropriate \nproducts. There again, shorter ingredient lists, av oiding certain colours, fragrances and \npreservatives are presented as sensible strategies to limit allergic reactions. However, the \narticle warns readers that the lack of homogenous t esting regulations is a major hurdle, \nsince some products are tested on large samples of women, whilst others only on small \nsamples of particularly sensitive women. In sum, th e article recommends that women with \nsensitive skins go to their dermatologist (or aller gologist) for a check-up. There, they can \nobtain an allergy pass which they should always hav e about them when purchasing new \ncosmetics since, as from July 1999, a so-called INC I list will have become compulsory for all \ncosmetic products. 1125   \n \nOtherwise, anti-ageing cosmetics are still the focu s of a lot of attention and energy. For \ninstance, a feature containing only letters to the editor displays a broad spectrum of \nreactions to an article published in Brigitte  earlier in 1985 on yet another brave or insane \n(depending on the viewpoint) attempt by one of its beauty editors to test a form of chemical \npeeling based on concentrated fruit acids. In the p rocess, the editor suffered severe burns \nand would have incurred scars had it not been for e mergency cortisone treatment. Readers\u2019 \nreactions then range from outrage: \n \nI was terribly upset by the horror trip article in your magazine.

Researchers define three causes that tri gger this sensitivity: \u201cthe skin\u2019s diminished \nbarrier function\u201d  which means that poisons can penetrate more easily , \u201ca heightened neuro- \nsensory activity\u201d  since nerve endings can be found even in the most superficial layers of the \nskin and are thus more prone to irritation, and \u201can increased immunological \nresponsiveness\u201d , whereby the body produces antibodies against subs tances that are a priori \nharmless for the skin, thus triggering allergies. T he article includes a test to determine the \nstate of the skin. 1147  \n \nConclusion \nThese last two articles provide a good basis to sta rt outlining the conclusion of this case-\nstudy, since they foreground the medicalisation of cosmetics as well as the unique status of \nthe skin. To begin with the latter, the central and  ambivalent status of the skin is perhaps the \nmost striking aspect that transpires from the ads a nd articles of the two decades under \nconsideration. Indeed, the skin, as the largest, mo st peripheral and ubiquitous organ of the \n                                                 \n1144  \u201eDer Winterfahrplan f\u00fcr gesunde Haut\u201c in \u201eSch\u00f6n&ge sund\u201c supplement ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 19, 1999, pp. 8-12, p. \n10): \u201e Die Kombination von Kosmetik und Medizin zeigt sich  darin, da\u00df immer mehr active Wirkstoffe von der \nMedizin in die Kosmetik gelangen, die hierf\u00fcr die o ptimalen Grundlagen und Anwendungssysteme zur \nVerf\u00fcgung stellt.\u201c; \u201edie Zuf\u00fchrung stoffwechselakti vierender Substanzen wie Hormone, Vitamine, Kollage n, \nElastin, Mineralien, und zwar von au\u00dfen und innen.

It contains the body in the sense that it is \nits most obvious receptacle while circumscribing th e body\u2019s space since it effectively draws a \nlimit between inside and out. Its barrier function,  protecting the body against a variety of \npathogens, excess fluid loss or loss of essential n utrients through exposure to a variety of \nenvironmental influences, is enhanced by an excreto ry function (sweating) that enables the \nbody to regulate its temperature. The skin\u2019s sensor y properties are crucial to human (and \nanimal) survival \u2013from the perception of temperatur es, textures, pressure or vibration to the \nmediation of pain through its numerous nerve ending s. As the seat of the sense of touch \u2013a \nsense that is often downplayed in contrast with e.g . sight or audition\u2013 it represents babies\u2019 \nfirst gateway to the world and throughout human lif e, it remains the prime medium of \nintimacy. Moreover, it represents an important mark er of well-being \u2013be it physiological, \nmental or emotional\u2013 betraying e.g. liver problems,  a junk food diet, the hormonal storm \nraging inside teenagers or a variety of existential  problems expressed through pallor, rashes \nor dark circles. Finally, it is considered a crucia l ingredient of youthful beauty, hence perforce \nthe most merciless indicator of age. These last \u201cmi rror\u201d functions point towards the crucial \nsocial role of the skin: a person\u2019s skin is one of the first aspects apprehended upon \nencounter. It functions like a barometer since it h elps us guess people\u2019s ages, diets or \nsleeping patterns as well as their overall health a nd happiness, while determining to a large \nextent their potential attractiveness.  \n \nThis then explains why so much hope and hard work i s invested in the cosmetic domain \u2013be \nit from the producer or the consumer side\u2013 and why the search for natural, technological or \nhybrid solutions to counter the effects of time, il l health, unhealthy lifestyles or emotional \ncrises will no doubt remain an ongoing enterprise. The most challenging aspect in this quest \nis the one mentioned in an article we already discu ssed, namely: \n  \nThe aim now is to outsmart the skin by smuggling fr om outside the active ingredients and \ncellular building blocks that over time are no long er so abundantly produced by the body. \nThe biggest challenge here is transporting these su bstances into the subcutaneous tissue \nwhere new cells are formed. Indeed this is not a pa th foreseen by nature since the skin is an \nexcretory organ. 1148  \n \nThis explains a fundamental \u201cphilosophical\u201d tension  that can be witnessed again and again in \nthe analysis of product ads, a tension between a te chnological \u201cfix-it\u201d mentality and a more \nholistically or naturally \u201csupportive\u201d attitude. 1149  The first strategy is eminently positivist and \nprogressivist in its approach. It is postulated on the observation that the skin\u2019s metabolic \ndesign is flawed or at least that its successful fu nctioning is extremely short-lived, thus \njustifying a scientifically-based interventionism. Indeed, upon reading the ads, one gets the \n                                                 \n1148  \u201eAnti-Falten-Kosmetik: Was ist wirklich dran?\u201c ( prima , Heft 7, 1988, p. 122) \n1149  One explanation for these contrasting mentalities reflected in discourse is the actual economic orien tation \nof the manufacturers. Geoffrey Jones sees the beaut y industry as structured in three main types of fir ms: large \nconsumer products companies, pharmaceutical compani es and specialty firms focusing on a particular typ e or \nrange of products. Cf. Jones, Geoffrey, \u201cBlonde and  blue-eyed? Globalizing beauty, c. 1945-c. 1980\u201d, o p. cit., p. \n129. Empirically considered, one does notice a tend ency towards more scientifically- or medically-orie nted \ndiscourse for products emanating from pharmaceutica l and large consumer products companies. In this \nrespect, one obvious reason may also be a financial  one: these companies are the ones that boast the b est \nendowed and most sophisticated research laboratorie s. However, over time, neat distinctions between th e \nvarious companies tend to blur; witness e.g. the sc ientisation of natural cosmetics or the naturalisat ion of \nmainstream cosmetics. \n 266 \n \nimpression that the skin ages so quickly that it re quires permanent stimulation or even \nresuscitation. Consequently, cosmetics are designed  in medically-equipped laboratories by \nhighly-trained specialists who usually stem from th e biochemical, pharmacological or \ndermatological fields. Their aim is two-fold. First , they have to find, extract, develop or \nsynthesise the most effective substances to stimula te or regenerate the skin\u2019s metabolism. \nAnd second, they must search for optimal vehicles \u2013 from liposomes to nanosomes or so-\ncalled \u201cultraparts\u201d\u2013 to effectively transport these  substances to the deeper layers of the \nskin, thus going against its natural excretory func tion. Once developed, the cosmetic \nproducts are tested using extremely sophisticated i nstrumentation in collaboration with \nvarying numbers of test-persons either recruited by  the company itself or through a \ndermatological clinic, before being mass-manufactur ed in meticulously clean and sterile \nenvironments.  \n \nIn this context, as noted by Dr Harald Gerny, inter viewed in the penultimate article I \ndiscussed, cosmetology can hardly be distinguished from pharmacology or dermatology \u2013\nhence his recourse to the term \u201ccosmeceuticals\u201d to describe contemporary cosmetic \ndevelopments. Prospective consumers are then relent lessly reminded that the effects of \nthese products are \u201cscientifically proven\u201d and \u201cgua ranteed\u201d by prominent health \n\u201cauthorities\u201d, provided the cosmetics are applied c orrectly within often complexly-\nstructured cosmetic programmes. In this case, consu mers are viewed as rather passive and \ncompliant recipients of an active cream. They shoul d be fittingly awed by cosmetological \nprowess and grateful for these impressive scientifi c innovations. An exacerbation of this \nscientific \u201cfix-it\u201d trend are the repeated attempts  to publicize extreme peeling or \ndermabrasive interventions that border on plastic s urgery, using potentially dangerous \ntechniques and substances. The more or less overt j ustification for these invasive methods is \na refusal to let natural ageing processes codetermi ne consumers\u2019 self-perceived age. \nConsumers\u2019 readiness to embrace the hazards charact erising these procedures often \noverlooks the reservations voiced by some dermatolo gists while ignoring the dubious \ncredentials of other practioners. Nevertheless, the  feature articles discussing these trends \nstill do convey a sense of their controversiality: despite the perceivedly legitimate \ndesirability of pursuing a youthful appearance, the  authors usually emphasise the high risks \nand costs involved in these \u201cDorian Gray\u201d enterpris es. When reader reactions are available, \npredictably enough, they appear to span a broad spe ctrum: from outraged rejection to \nunreserved enthusiasm through cautious interest.  \n \nThe second, more \u201cnatural\u201d or holistic product stra tegy implicitly or explicitly acknowledges \nthe validity of the skin\u2019s natural metabolism, prof essing to respect it while providing \nadequate support. In contrast with the more hardlin e \u201cscientific\u201d perception described \nabove, the skin here is viewed as a living organ th at has significant resources to regenerate \nitself but may require occasional encouragement. He nce, the motto in this context is \n\u201chelping the skin to help itself\u201d. In this context,  nature represents a very malleable cipher \nthat assumes a variety of authentic or more superfi cial roles: from cornucopia to pedigree, \nfrom relaxing retreat to energising (re)source, fro m strong ally to more vulnerable and \nprecious entity, or from a symbol of simplicity and  purity to an emblem of sophistication and \ncomplexity. A number of ads thus evoke human beings \u2019 estrangement from a generous and \nprotective nature \u2013as emblematised by Aok \u2019s injunctions to go count the trees instead of \nkilometres\u2013 while enjoining consumers to trust natu re\u2019s wisdom and enjoy her bounty. \nFurthermore, the discourse surrounding naturally-or iented products usually identifies multi-267 \n \nfactorial influences on the skin\u2019s health since the  skin is recognised as a \u201cmirror\u201d organ. It \ntherefore preaches a holistic approach to skincare,  emphasising the importance of a healthy \nlifestyle, including diet, sleep, exercise and emot ional equilibrium. Consumers in this realm \nare perceived as proactive agents who are assigned increased responsibility in the \nmanagement of their personal skin ecology. Indeed, the ads in this stream clearly prescribe \nlifestyle changes \u2013from the duty to eat fruit and v egetables or to jog regularly to the mission \nof relaxing. This discourse on appropriate lifestyl e provides a rather thought-provoking \nprojection of (mainly) women\u2019s routines during thes e two decades. Their increasing \nprofessionalisation outside the home has visibly ad ded an extra burden on their shoulders, \nsince the extant duty to remain youthful and attrac tive is now coupled with the imperative \nof being ever more productive, resistant and flexib le \u2013a dimension I have already discussed \nin previous chapters.   \n \nIf the two trends I have just described seem so pol arised as to appear irreconcilable, over the \ntwo decades examined, I have also noted increasing efforts to bypass or reconcile ostensible \ncontradictions. The first very enduring tactic is t o offer \u201cno-frills\u201d products that simply elude \nthe nature-technology dichotomy, such as the origin al Nivea cream. Often, they are \ntraditional products that have been tried and teste d over the years, thus no longer requiring \nan extensive introduction. Some of them have also b een marketed as baby products, such as \ne.g. Penaten . The implication in this case is that a product de signed for ultra-sensitive infant \nskin is naturally suited to all other (more mature)  skin types. Therefore, the appeal of these \ncreams resides in their \u201call-in-one\u201d simplicity: mo re or less explicitly, they are presented as \nan effective weapon to counter the complexity and s tress involved in late-modern routines. \nTypically, slogans used to market them emphasise em otionality and spontaneity.  \n \nBut a more decisive element that increasingly bridg es the gap between the \u201cscientific\u201d and \nthe \u201cholistic\u201d realms, is the perception and articu lation of increasing environmental threats. \nFrom our contemporary perspective though, the use o f the term \u201cenvironment\u201d in these ads \nmay appear somewhat confusing since they usually re fer to human surroundings in general \nrather than to the natural ecosystem. In this accep tion, the environment encompasses \nnatural threats (such as wind, dust, weather \u2013hence  varying temperatures\u2013 and, from the \nearly 1990s, light) as well as man-made menaces (es pecially air-conditioning, pollution and \nthe arch-enemy stress). This makes for an increasin gly paranoid rhetoric that presents the \nskin as extremely reactive, vulnerable and in need of protection, thus paving the way for a \nnew generation of \u201csensitive\u201d products. These produ cts are designed to be as neutral or \u201c-\nfree\u201d as possible (avoiding the excesses of both na ture and technology), culminating in a \nform of \u201csupernature\u201d, as in  Payot \u2019s Amniotique , a womb-like cream to protect the skin from \n\u201cthe harshness of life\u201d .1150   \n \nOver time however, the collocation of nature and te chnology in the same product no longer \nseems to require elaborate justifications, indeed i t even becomes a trump because the \nhybrid commodity thus obtained can claim the best o f both worlds. A number of products \nemblematise this trend, such as Monteil \u2019s ICE  or a number of Biotherm  creams: they boast \nnatural extracts and a respect for natural processe s while guaranteeing industrial control in \nterms of purity and effectiveness. Implicitly, thes e products may represent the recognition \nthat there is no way back to an unadulterated natur e or a surefire technology. Indeed, \n                                                 \n1150  Cf. the previously discussed ad for Payot Amniotiq ue ( F\u00fcr Sie , Heft 20, 1983). 268 \n \ncosmetics have always been the fruit of a more or l ess harmonious compromise between \nnature and technology \u2013from traditional application s of flowers, leaves, roots, vegetables, \nfruit, mud, honey or dairy products to lethally lea ded or bleaching cosmetics (still en vogue \nin some parts of the world) and more contemporary l iposome emulsions or organic creams. \nConcretely, this means that even the most primitive  natural cosmetics involve technological \nknow-how in terms of extraction, blending, etc. whi le mainstream industrial cosmetics \nultimately derive from a natural source however est ranged, be it coconut, soy, potash, \npetrolatum, mink oil, whale blubber or calf embryos . Moreover, as far as industrial \nprocessing and conditioning are concerned, so-calle d \u201cnatural\u201d products can hardly be \ndistinguished from \u201chigh-tech\u201d ones.  \n \nThus what seems to be at play here is a question of  degree, i.e. the type of chemical, \nphysical or bio-technological refinement (e.g. isol ation, extraction, cultivation, distillation, \nhomogenisation, hydrogenation, etc.). Hence cosmeti cs can cover the spectrum from a \nsimple face mask involving cucumber and yogurt blen ded in a private kitchen to laboratory \ndesigned \u201cnano-parts\u201d for the facilitated transport ation of e.g. hyaluronic acid, collagen or \ngingko extracts between epithelium cells. Typically , the first will most likely be labelled \nnatural while the second will be considered high-te ch. However, in view of the previous \nargument, I would like to argue that the essential naturalness or artificiality of a cosmetic \ningredient or product can hardly be convincingly an d definitively decided. Indeed, the ads \nconsidered clearly show that it is mainly a hermene utic-ideological question. Both the \ndenotations and connotations of \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201carti ficial\u201d (or \u201ctechnical\u201d) labels vary widely \nacross time and space. For instance connotations su ch as gentleness, safety and efficacy on \nthe one hand or aggressiveness, allergenicity and i nappropriateness, on the other can be and \nare attributed to both \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201chigh-tech\u201d pr oducts.  \n \nMoreover, these considerations extend well beyond t he product to the perception of the \nbody as well as lifestyle and environmental issues.  Throughout the period under \nconsideration, these realms are intensively negotia ted and \u201cbaddie\u201d and \u201cgoodie\u201d roles \nregularly re-distributed. One moment, the ageing bo dy, stressed modern routines and a \npolluted environment are the ultimate enemies and t he next, the self-regenerating body, an \nactive modern lifestyle and a precious eco-system a re the most valuable allies. In parallel, \nnature and technology alternately foster freeing an d clearing versus controlling and \nregulating; opening and peeling versus protecting a nd insulating; soothing and relaxing \nversus stimulating and activating, softening versus  toning; sensitising versus strengthening; \ncooling versus warming; nourishing, comforting, bal ancing and harmonising versus cleansing, \npurifying and detoxifying.  \n \nThe last noteworthy dimension is a gradual \u201cemotion alisation\u201d of the skin, especially \ntowards the end of the period considered. This step  seems to go beyond acknowledging the \nskin as a holistic mirror to personalise or anthrop omorphise it. Linked to the discourse on \nstress and allergies, the skin becomes an entity in  and of itself with human needs and \nfeelings: it can glow, radiate, and relax or it can  sulk, overreact, break out and revenge, thus \nimplying that, just as a child, it requires care, p ampering and protection as well as \nsurveillance and subtle control or disciplining. In  this context, consumers are assigned the \nrole of benevolently responsible parents, whose dut y is to bring out the best from their \noffspring.  \n 269 \n \nCHAPTER 7 \nCONCLUSION  \nON THE CHALLENGES OF CATERING TO FITNESS FREAKS, WE LLNESS GURUS \nAND THE REST OF US\u2026  \n \nWhite people need organic food to survive, and wher e they purchase this food is as \nimportant as what they purchase. In modern white pe rson culture, Whole Foods has replaces \n[sic] churches and cathedrals as the most important and r elevant buildings in the community. \n[\u2026] Many white people consider shopping at Whole Fo ods to be a religious experience, \nallowing them feel [sic]  good about their consumption.

In a \nlawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in L os Angeles, she accuses the yogurt maker of \na \u201cmassive and comprehensive\u201d false advertising cam paign for its Activia, Activia Light and \nDanActive products. Dannon promotes them as clinica lly proven to help regulate digestion \nand boost immunity because they contain bacteria th at Wiener\u2019s suit says aren\u2019t so special. \n\u201cYou\u2019re hearing these scientific terms and you\u2019re t hinking that they have come up with \nsomething,\u201d said the Northridge resident, who owns a catering company. \u201cBut the only effect \nthat it had on me was that it tasted poorly\u201d. 1152  \n         Alana Semuels, LA Times \nThis study is nearing its conclusion but a nagging question remains: how does one cater to \nfitness freaks, wellness gurus and the rest of us?  \n \nI have chosen two emblematic examples that highligh t the ends of a broad consumer \nspectrum \u2013from the quasi-religious practice of comm odified healthy living to a much more \nsceptical stance towards the market\u2019s healthful off erings. Admittedly, the first depiction is \nrather satirical while the second may appear far-fe tched \u2013at least from a European \nperspective. But Americanisation, especially as it transpires from Hollywood celebrities and \nthe lifestyles they promote, is an influence to rec kon with in the German-speaking world \n(and more broadly in Europe), even if the American way of life is selectively understood and \nincorporated. Thus, German parallels abound 1153  and these \u201cmelodramatic\u201d American \n                                                 \n1151  Christian Lander, \u201c# 48 Whole Foods and Grocery Co -ops\u201d, Stuff White People Like , February 3 rd  2008: \nhttp://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/2008/02/03/48-whole -foods-and-grocery-co-ops/ .

Similarly, the European subsidiary of \nDannon , i.e. Danone , has also faced some consumer resistance linked to  deceitful advertising, albeit more on 270 \n \narchetypes do a really good job of encapsulating th e seeming contradictions in the field of \nhealthy lifestyle technologies (HLTs). Indeed, at f ace-value, Wholefoods  promotes socio-\necologically correct living in most of its aspects 1154  and may appear locally-rooted whereas \nDannon  (or Danone  as is it called outside of the U.S.), as a heavywe ight food multinational, \nmay seem more ruthlessly global in its approach to marketing. 1155  However a closer look \nreveals more similarities than expected: Wholefoods , if it does not yet boast Danone \u2019s global \nclout, can still be considered a multinational sinc e it already owns more than 300 stores in \nthe U.S., Canada and the U.K. 1156   and just as Danone  is a world yogurt leader, Wholefoods  is \nthe biggest retailer of natural and organic foods w orldwide. 1157  Furthermore, even if it may \nbe tempting to dismiss its sustainable development initiatives as \u201cgreen-\u201d, \u201csocial-\u201d or \n\u201chealth-washing\u201d, Danone  appears intent on promoting a health-conscious as well as \necologically and socially sustainable image. 1158   \n \nSimilarly, the two consumer extremes portrayed here  \u2013from the seemingly left-leaning, \npredominantly white and often well-heeled \u201ceco-cons cious\u201d or \u201cmoral hedonist\u201d shopper 1159  \nto the perhaps more pragmatically conservative and wary customer\u2013 may not strike one as \nsharing much common ideological ground. However, th e rather monolithic impression \nconveyed by the above consumer impersonations obscu res the fact that most consumer \nattitudes are rarely as clear-cut or at odds with e ach other and that rationales for indulging \nin particular HLTs or not may often appear quite in triguing if not downright irrational when \nviewed from an external perspective. This represent s one of the biggest challenges for \nhistorians of consumption, who wish to reconstrue t he motivations of consumers leading to \nparticular purchase and use decisions, since they r arely get the opportunity to engage live \nconsumers in conversation about their choices and, when they do, it is usually so late after \nthe fact that the echo obtained is bound to be very  selective or distorted. In that respect, the \nethnographer Roberta Sassatelli tauntingly reminds us of the advantages of her disciplinary \nperspective in her analysis of fitness studio consu mption:  \n \n                                                                                                                                                         \nthe public image level than on the legal front, cf.  \nhttp://foodwatch.de/kampagnen__themen/ampelkennzeic hnung/ampeltest/wellness_enttarnt/index_ger.htm \nl, \nhttp://foodwatch.de/presse/pressearchiv/2011/etiket tenschwindel_mit_probiotischem_joghurt/index_ger.ht\nml , http://foodwatch.de/presse/pressearchiv/2009/golden er_windbeutel_aktion/index_ger.html  & \nhttp://www.abgespeist.de/activia/index_ger.html .

Personally, I find the latter term parti cularly fitting\u2026 Cf. Kirig, Anja & Wenzel, Eike, Lohas. Bewusst \ngr\u00fcn \u2013 Alles \u00fcber die neuen Lebenswelten , M\u00fcnchen: Redline Verlag, 2009. 271 \n \nSeen from the ethnographic close-up, choice is reve aled as a process, rather than a cost-\nbenefit decision. A transformative, ongoing practic e rather than an accomplished, rational \ncalculation. Instead of revealed preferences, we ge t a rather hybrid mix of decisions, \nconstraints, habits, contingencies, aspirations, in teractions, relations \u2013 each of which may be \nmore or less satisfying, and may or may not lead to  further consumption. The notion of \nrational choice \u2013 operationalised in mainstream eco nomics through the cunning conflation of \n\u201crevealed preferences\u201d \u2013 obliges us to either imagi ne a sovereign consumer, or to reject it \naltogether opting for notions such as \u201cinduced need s\u201d and \u201cfalse consciousness\u201d. \nEthnography has offered a third, less dramatic, but  more daring picture. In such a picture, the \nboundaries between production and consumption seem to be shifting and, to an extent, \nblurred. Consumption is revealed as an ambivalent p ractice, with consumers increasingly \nasked to be active producers of cultural forms that  are nevertheless largely circulated and \nmanaged by producers who need to consume much of th e very same sort they produce. 1160  \n \nThis late modern co-production (or co-consumption) phenomenon means that the rules of \nthe consumption game have changed: if indeed consum ers are to become \u201cactive producers \nof cultural forms that are nevertheless largely cir culated and managed by producers who \nneed to consume much of the very same sort they pro duce\u201d , they require a number of \noptions that \u2013at least superficially\u2013 provide them with a sense of agency. To my mind, these \noptions are conditioned by a number of marketing st rategies based on particular values that \nhave been historically and situatively negotiated b etween producers, mediators and \nconsumers in order to ensure a successful transform ation of generic products into HLTs. 1161   \n \nWe have seen numerous examples of these strategies in Chapters 5 ( Food case-study ) and 6 \n(Cosmetics case-study ). However, I would like to now clarify their speci fic characteristics. \nIndeed, I contend that the commodification of healt h and well-being is streamlined along \nspecific channels all flavoured by the recombinance  ethic discussed in the \n\u201cCommodification\u201d section of Chapter 3 ( Theory ) \u2013especially since they are often used in \ncombination. The first five strategies are those th at are the most tangibly linked to the \ngenetic metaphor: i.e. isolation (the singling out and development of health product s and  \npractices from extant realms), multiplication  (the cultivation of diversification in the health \noffer), hybridisation  (the splicing of healthy elements that are not tra ditionally associated), \ncreolisation  (the intensification of health hybridisation invol ving transcultural admixture), \nand semiotisation  linked to its correlate resemiotisation . \n \nThe first recombinant strategy I want to address is  isolation and its correlate  simplification . \nJust as in genetics, where particular genes have to  be identified and singled out before being \ncut and spliced into the DNA of a recipient cell, a  similar process is at work in the \ncommodification of health. Concretely, this strateg y implies that particular products, \nservices and practices are isolated from extant con stellations. They can then be grafted onto \nnew constellations but are often re-designed and la unched as separate novel products, \ndisciplines or practices. The realms of movement or  alternative therapies are particularly \n                                                 \n1160  Sassatelli, Roberta, op. cit., pp. 199-200.  \n1161  Cf. Shove, Elizabeth, op. cit., p. 94:  \u201cAlthough I argue that peoples\u2019 routines are shape d and moulded by the \ncollective conventions of the day, I do not suppose  that conventions simply mirror theories of disease , new \nsystems of social discrimination or the restructuri ng of institutions and infrastructures. Without rea ching for a \nfunctional account of action and purpose, I suggest  that private habits are constructed as people stee r their \nown course through culturally and temporally specif ic landscapes of legitimating discourse and classif ications of \nordinary and extraordinary behaviour.\u201d  272 \n \nemblematic of this process. Particularly striking e xamples are the \u201ccreation\u201d of jogging \n(through isolation from athletic running), 1162  stretching (through isolation from yoga and \nother traditional disciplines), or western acupunct ure and reflexology (through isolation \nand/or simplification from Traditional Chinese Medi cine). 1163  The establishment of these \nindependent disciplines is often premised upon the claim that they are easier to master and \nto market for practitioners, while being more acces sible and less \u201cesoterically foreign\u201d for \nconsumers. In turn, this development leads to the c reation of specific gear (e.g. special \nshorts, leotards, T-shirts, headbands, etc.), appli ances (e.g. pulse monitors, steppers, etc.), \nspaces (e.g. the fitness studio or naturopathic pra ctice), practices (e.g. jogging or training \nduring the lunch break or after work, attending wee kend seminars and workshops), \nprofessions (expert trainers and practitioners) as well as information (books, videos etc.) \ndetailing the specificities of the \u201cnew\u201d discipline s.  \n \nAs hinted at when discussing commodification in Cha pter 3 ( Theory ) \u2013I then mentioned the \nexample of soap\u2013 industrialisation has also permitt ed an unprecedented multiplication 1164  of \nalmost negligibly differentiated goods in all the d omains of everyday life in order to cater to \nthe needs and/or wants of new target groups or segm ents \u2013which were discovered (or \ncreated) in parallel. The cosmetic realm is particu larly emblematic of these transformations: \nfor example, the \u201cNivea\u201d all-purpose family cream I  grew up with in the 1970s is now \ncompletely overshadowed by a range of products for babies, teenagers, middle-aged and \nelderly customers who may \u201csuffer\u201d from rough, dry,  oily, mixed, sensitive or allergic \nskins. 1165  Developments are especially spectacular in the fie ld of men\u2019s cosmetics: the \nerstwhile winning combination \u2013i.e. soap, shaving s oap and after-shave\u2013 for the smart man \n                                                 \n1162  I should sound a caveat here: whilst a majority of  commodification strategies are the fruit of consci ous and \ndeliberate planning, many major historical developm ents associated with these strategies, such as the \u201cbirth\u201d \nof jogging, are the mixed offspring of purpose and situative contingencies. But as George Sage contend s: \u201cSo \naggressive is the capitalist fitness industry that many informal, anonymous, unorganized fitness activ ities have \nbeen incorporated into the market. The running boom  provides a good example. It began with the desire of \nindividuals who had been excluded from high perform ance, elitist sport to enjoy a simple form of exerc ise on \ntheir own terms for their own health. Within a few years a massive commercial \u2018running industry,\u2019 with  \nmultinational firms merchandising running shoes and  other accessories, was created. Moreover, running for fun \nbecame overshadowed by marathon races, triathlons, and \u2018ironman\u2019 competitions, many sponsored by large  \ncorporations and winners of these events paid for t his labor. Thus individual and group fitness activi ties have  \nbecome incorporated into dominant commercial struct ures and meanings.\u201d  Cf. Sage, George H., \u201cThe Political \nEconomy of Fitness in the United States\u201d, Fitness as cultural phenomenon , op. cit., p. 121. \n1163  Claudia Freidl provides very convincing descriptio ns of how Tai Ji Quan, Yoga, Feng Shui and oriental  \nhammam rituals were simplified from their original roots for a western audience. Cf. Freidl, Claudia, op. cit., pp. \n38-40. \n1164  One could argue here for \u201ccloning\u201d as a more \u201cgene tically-appropriate\u201d term but because it focuses on  \nexact replication, it misses out on the diversifica tion typical of HLTs. Otherwise, Freidl also correl ates my \nanalysis: \u201eGerade die Steigerung der Optionen trifft auf einen  Trend wie Wellness besonders zu. Tagt\u00e4glich \nlanden mehr Wellnessprodukte auf dem Markt und die Menschen selbst streben nach mehr Gesundheit und \nmehr Wohlbefinden. \u201c Ibid., p. 103. \n1165  Cf. http://www.nivea.de/Produkte .

Therefore, many \nsupermarkets but also service providers (such as fi tness clubs or beauty institutes) will often \nsell products or services (or their communal use) a longside with other products or services. \nA good example of this phenomenon can be found in e .g. mail-order catalogues. For \ninstance, one of the offers under the \u201cSlim & Energetic\u201d  heading in the Neckermann \ncatalogue of 1999, simultaneously advertised cling film, a massage cream, a diet drink and \nscales \u2013in short a type of \u201cslimming kit\u201d.  1168  Similarly, Barry Glassner, after stating that \u201cA \nhybridization of potentially independent matters al so can be found in many of the most \nsuccessful commercial programs in the body improvem ent industry\u201d , goes on to provide \ntelling American examples such as Weight Watchers \u2019 policy to include exercise into its diet \nplan, Nautilus  (an exercise machines manufacturer) marketing Nautilus  workouts combined \nwith a low-cal diet to health clubs; or Nabisco  (a breakfast cereals manufacturer) including a \nmail-in coupon for a Jane Fonda exercise video. 1169   This type of offer implicitly states that \ninterested consumers should buy (and believe in) th e whole package because it \u201cincreases \nthe likelihood that the promised effect will set in \u201d .1170  Moreover, the producer can disclaim \nany responsibility if consumers fail to do so. Pote ntially, this represents a very clever \nstrategy: indeed, producers or mediators can always  defer responsibility for unsatisfactory \nresults to the fact that consumers have not purchas ed or correctly used a particular product, \nprocess or service included in the original constel lation. Ultimately then, consumers can \nalways be accused of not investing enough money, ti me, effort, etc. into their holistic body \nmaintenance.    \n \nBeyond the creolisation  \u2013i.e. the transcultural admixture\u20131171  to be found in health products \n(such as the Ananda  tea example) or services (e.g. the comparison betw een wellness \n                                                 \n1166  Cf. e.g. the development of face cream use in \u201eDer  Markt der Herrenkosmetik und Duftw\u00e4sser: Daten, \nFakten, Trends\u201c, Focus Medialine , May 2003 online edition, p. 18 [originally downlo aded from: \nwww.medialine.focus.de , now no longer available there] : \u201eSo verwendeten 1999 in Deutschland nur knapp 9,4 \nMio.

Schulze, Gerhard, \u201cZeit der Wunder: auch der n eue Modetrend Wellness ist Teil des Erlebnismarktes \u201d, \nop. cit. \n1171  This aspect is correlated by Claudia Freidl who as cribes it to two phenomena, the loss of traditions and \nmulticulturism: \u201eDer Verlust der Traditionen  ist ein weiteres Kennzeichen der Multioptionsgesel lschaft. Diverse \nWellnessprodukte und \u2013anwendungen konnten erst durc h Enttraditionalisierung vermarktet werden. Daf\u00fcr \ngelangten alte Traditionen aus China, Japan oder de m arabischen Raum in abgewandelter Form in die west liche 274 \n \ntreatments in Germany and wellness in India) which I have already discussed in the \n\u201cCommodification\u201d section of Chapter 3 ( Theory ), I now want to broach a closely linked \nphenomenon, i.e. the creolisation of health spaces and professions. 1172  An increasing trend \nin north-western Europe 1173  is to provide consumers with transcultural health spaces. \nConcretely, an increasing number of allopathic phys icians share premises with colleagues \npracticing Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda o r holistic traditions from other cultural \nspaces. Moreover, many mainstream MDs themselves ha ve garnered or are garnering \ndiplomas in (foreign) alternative medical practices1174  \u2013some variants of which are being \ninstitutionalised in western university settings. 1175  For consumers, this entails an exposure to \n\u201cexotic\u201d and alternative treatments that they may o therwise never get unless they travel \nextensively or have an inherent interest in these p ractices. In terms of further \ncommodification, it means that a potentially very p rofitable niche market will probably open \nup for special plant and mineral preparations that were previously confined to foreign or \nvery marginal markets. For the time being, traditio nal Chinese and Ayurvedic medication can \nonly be restrictively imported into Germany since d rugs from both traditions are still \nstumbling against the hurdle of scientific efficacy  proof. 1176  Moreover, it is still cheaper for \nmany companies to sell their Asian products as food  supplements, since the only \nrequirement in this field is to prove that they are  not harmful. 1177  Nevertheless, considering \nthe thriving tradition of homeopathic and naturopat hic preparations in Germany, 1178  one can \n                                                                                                                                                         \nGesellschaft. [\u2026] Die Multikulturalit\u00e4t stellt ein weiteres Kennzeichen der Multioptionsges ellschaft dar und den \nMix von Kulturen und Traditionen findet man in ausp r\u00e4gter Weise im Wellness-Ph\u00e4nomen wieder. Alte, zum  Teil \nantike Traditionen werden in Vital- und Wellnessoas en angeboten.\u201c Cf. Freidl, Claudia, op. cit., pp. 103-104. \n[emphasis in original] \n1172  Freidl mentions another interesting development th at of creolised martial arts such as so-called SenF i \n(Sensual Fighting) that is supposedly based on Kung -Fu, Qi Gong, Tai Chi and Karate and practised agai nst a \nPolynesian musical background. Cf. Ibid., p. 40.  \n1173  Here, I can only refer to regions I know first han d, but I would assume that this is also the case in  other \n\u201cpost-industrial\u201d economies.  \n1174  Cf. e.g. the German Physicians Association for Acu puncture [ Deutsche \u00c4rztegesellschaft f\u00fcr Akupunktur e.V. \n(D\u00c4GfA) ] that boasts a membership of 12.000: http://www.daegfa.de/Daegfa.Ueber_Uns.aspx . This may \nobscure the fact that there are many different prof essional associations and a large number of practic ing \nnaturopaths or acupuncturists that do not hold an o fficial medical title, cf. e.g. also \nhttp://www.tcm.edu/patienteninformationen/de_Aerzte __Therapeutenliste.aspx  & \nhttp://www.agtcm.de/therapeuten-suche.php . [websites accessed Aug. 2011] \n1175  For the time being in the German speaking-world, t his integration is more timid and experimental than  \ntruly curricular. Cf. e.g. the website hosted by by  the Technical University in Munich: \nhttp://www.muemo.med.tu-muenchen.de/ . [website accessed Aug. 2011] \n1176  Concerns have also focused on potential toxicity ( especially heavy metal contamination), the use of c ertain \nrare and/or forbidden animal products, the lack of hygienic standards, incomplete knowledge of potenti al side-\neffects and interactions, etc. For an overview of t he current situation involving TCM herbal drugs, cf . \nhttp://german.china.org.cn/culture/txt/2010-12/08/c ontent_21500381.htm  and the discussed European legal \ndirective http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?u ri=CELEX:32004L0024:EN:NOT . [websites \naccessed Aug. 2011]  \n1177  Indeed, explicit medical indications are still for bidden in this field, cf. e.g.: \nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahrungserg%C3%A4nzung smittel#Indikation.2FWirksamkeit  [website accessed \nOct. 2011] \n1178  To name but a few companies: http://www.salus.de/ , http://www.dhu.de/  or http://www.staufen-\npharma.de/ . Most homeo- or naturopathic preparations are sold  OTC but some are also prescribed by \ncorresponding practitioners or strongly recommended  when patients\u2019 insurances do not cover these remed ies. \nThis trend thus has a further consolidating ramific ation since a number of health insurances now cover  a few \nalternative treatments, usually if patients are wil ling to afford private insurance coverage or to pay  an extra fee \non top of compulsory coverage. Cf. e.g. http://www.test.de/themen/versicherung-\nvorsorge/meldung/Alternative-Behandlungsverfahren-S anfte-Medizin-von-der-Kasse-1336445-1342776/  & 275 \n \nimagine that, once Ayurveda and traditional Chinese  medicine have overcome the obstacles \njust mentioned, they will probably follow similar p aths. 1179   \n \nThe four strategies analysed until now heavily rely  on semiotisation  and resemiotisation  as \nprocesses of meaning ascription and meaning change.  I have already indirectly alluded to \nsemiotisation  when describing the \u201csemiotic work\u201d necessary to t ransform ordinary tea into \nan HLT. But now I would like to actually coin and p resent the concepts of semiotisation  (from \nthe German \u201cSemiotisierung\u201d) and resemiotisation  (from the German \u201cUmsemiotisierung\u201d) \nbecause the processes of meaning ascription and (re -)encoding have become so ubiquitous \nand self-conscious as to warrant specific termini. Semiotisation  is a process that can be \ndetected in all the realms of consumption and it ac tively contributes to the process of \ncommodification \u2013especially as it pertains to immat erial realms. In the health arena, we \nnoted that apparently simple signifiers such as \u201cal oe vera\u201d or \u201cginseng\u201d betrayed a shift from \ndenotative to connotative signifiers. The latter ca n be multiplied almost ad libitum to include \na multiplicity of realms and references (dreams, em otions, sensations or gender, race, \nvalues, etc.). However, I would argue that, within the HLT realm, a tenuous hint of the \n\u201chealth\u201d signified remains, a form of \u201coriginal gho st\u201d that shadows the term, lending ginseng \nits \u201chealthy Asian\u201d reputation or aloe vera its \u201cpu rifying, hydrating\u201d aura, even if all precise \ndenotation has been lost. 1180  This ghostly semantics thus has a binding effect, reuniting a \nnumber of apparently unrelated terms under the umbr ella of \u201chealth\u201d or \u201cwell-being\u201d.  \n \nIn sum then, semiotisation  allows for a setting free from strict, literal acc eptions. However, \nthe moorings are not entirely severed as Jean Baudr illard contended with his \n\u201chyperreality\u201d 1181  concept, i.e. signs (and the commodities they refe r to) are not cut off from \na wider referential system, hence purely self-refer ential. Of course objectively, notions such \nas \u201chealth-enhancing\u201d, \u201cwholesome\u201d or \u201cnutritious\u201d may seem self-referential or simply \nideological but subjectively, they may be revived a s defensible in a primarily experiential \neconomy. However, if the use of most signs, product s, processes etc. within a subjective \nrealm can be justified through a healthy intent , it does not mean that the individual subject \nis an island. Like the  \u201ctransvaluation\u201d process 1182  that can be detected at the product or \nmacro-level (whereby many products have been endowe d with a \u201chealthy\u201d connotation in \nthe last decades), semiotisation  at the semantic or micro-level (whereby a \u201chealthy \u201d \nconnotation is attached to specific signs) is also the fruit of a societal consensus \u2013however \ntemporary or superficial. Hence, if semiotisation  results from a more or less conscious social \nagreement, it can also be reversed (just as commodi fication). In the course of time, signifiers \nmay lose (some of) their connotative signifieds or acquire new ones.   \n \n                                                                                                                                                         \nhttp://www.test.de/themen/gesundheit-kosmetik/meldu ng/Alternative-Therapien-Kassen-muessen-zahlen-\n1335192-2335192/ . [websites accessed Aug. 2011] \n1179  Expecially in view of the array of exotically insp ired \u201chealth supplements\u201d that are already sold OTC  in a \nnumber of pharmacies and drugstores (e.g. cumin or neem oil, gingko capsules, etc.), not to mention th e bitter \nlegal battles generated by so-called \u201cbioprospectin g\u201d or \u201cbiopiracy\u201d. For once, Wikipedia provides a p retty \ngood overview of the phenomenon including a variety  of sources, cf.: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercialization_of_t raditional_medicines . [website accessed Aug. 2011]  \n1180  Indeed, many individuals may be unaware that ginse ng is a root or aloe vera a cactus and most people \nwould probably be unable to quote any of the bioche mical properties, let alone physiological effects o f these \nplants. \n1181  Cf. Baudrillard, Jean, Pour une \u00e9conomie politique du signe , Paris: Gallimard, 1972. \n1182  A phenomenon described by Mike Featherstone (op. c it., 1991), and discussed in Chapter 1 ( Introduction ).  276 \n \nThis phenomenon is particularly evident from the ge nder perspective, where resemiotisation  \naffects both signifiers on a micro-level and produc ts and processes on a macro-level. I define \nresemiotisation  as a two way semiotic gender shift that enables th e ascription of masculine \nconnotations to signifiers and products initially c oded as feminine and vice versa. This shift is \nparticularly obvious in the realms of nutrition, co smetics and movement. For example, the \nfirst two domains have long been coded as feminine especially in terms of \u201chealth-\nconscious\u201d nutrition and skin-care. Thus, in primar ily \u201cwestern\u201d societies and until relatively \nrecently, skincare and healthfoods, as well as popu lar education about their proper \nimplementation, have been targeted mainly at women.  But in the last couple of decades, \nsigns and products have been gradually re-engineere d to appeal to a masculine audience. \nTerms such as \u201ccollagen\u201d, \u201csensitive\u201d, \u201clight\u201d or \u201c dietary fibres\u201d are losing their feminine \nconnotation just like products such as face cream, body lotion, diet drinks and meals, or \nhealth supplements have been made more acceptable f or a masculine target group. \nAlternately, the same can be said about women and c ertain movement practices: the mainly \nmasculine connotation of terms such as \u201cperformance \u201d, \u201cpower\u201d \u201cbody-building\u201d and \n\u201ctoning\u201d as well as practices such as weight-liftin g, martial arts or boxing has been watered \ndown. Packaging, illustrations and positive role mo dels have reinforced these linguistic and \ntransvaluation processes and the media, especially men\u2019s and women\u2019s magazines, have \nplayed a non-negligible educational role in this ar ena \u2013as can be witnessed in a number of \narticles or websites on e.g. healthy diets for men or women practicing extreme sports. 1183    \n \nA good example of education towards resemiotisation  can be found in a Men\u2019s Health issue \npublished  in 2001. 1184  An entire article is devoted to the subject of fac e cream. The first part \nsketches two \u201chorror scenarios\u201d (spots/rash and ski n irritation) and points towards the \nsolution: face creams. It then provides a basic des cription of their effects as well as a \ncomparison between male and female skin structure a nd it emphasises the importance of \nvitamins, etc. The second part dwells on pharmaceut ical aspects (laboratory responsibility, \ntests, main ingredients, product development, etc.)  including a modelisation of the skin \nstructure. Finally, the third part is a DIY-test de signed to help the reader define the nature of \nhis skin type (oily, dry, mixed, etc.). Most of the se features are typical of the strategies used \nto push face cream for women in the last decades, w hile other features emphasise the \nspecificities of masculine needs. However, the gene ral style of the article is carefully crafted \nto appeal to what is construed as men\u2019s specific in terests: the tone, references and \nillustrations are very technical and purely aesthet ic considerations extremely limited. \nSimilarly, an ad for Labello Active  lipsalve pictures a dashing middle-aged man dresse d in a \nwetsuit against a turbulent aquatic background. He is dangerously leaning out of what looks \nlike a surfboard or a catamaran whilst gazing in th e distance. His right hand tightly grips a \nmetallic rod while his left hand reaches half-way t owards his lips with a Labello Active  stick. \nThe heading bluntly states: \u201cFor rough male lips: Labello Active. \u2022one-hand-mec hanics \u2022no \nshine.\u201d .1185  At least three aspects code the product as masculi ne: the cultural landscape of \nextreme watersports, the absence of gloss, and the technical gimmick \u2013whereby instead of a \n                                                 \n1183  Cf. e.g. http://www.weightlossresources.co.uk/diet/healthy_d iet/diet_for_men.htm  & \nhttp://www.mensfitness.com/nutrition/abs-health ; or http://www.sun-wellness.com/articles/061feat3.html , \nhttp://www.xgirlsport.com/  or http://www.theelitephysique.com/ .

I have already alluded to the  techno-naturalisation  phenomenon in the \n\u201cTechnology\u201d section of Chapter 3 ( Theory ), and more indirectly in the \u201cAnanda tea\u201d \nexample discussed in the \u201cCommodification\u201d section of the same chapter as well as a \nleitmotiv recurring throughout Chapter 6 ( Cosmetics case-study ). What is at stake here is in \nfact a two way process: the naturalisation of techn ology and the technologisation of nature. \nThis strategy aims at dissolving all tensions from what was long considered as an artificial but \nunavoidable marriage. And it functions rather simpl y: nature and technology are presented \nas two indispensable poles in the description and c omposition of products and they are \noften perceived as complementary motors of innovati on and/or guarantors of health. Even \nwhen nature is foregrounded at the expense of techn ology, technology often reappears in \ncovert ways, e.g. in the small print about a produc t\u2019s effects, in the ingredient list, in \nindications about how the product is manufactured, etc. And when technology is \nemphasised, it is frequently styled as contributing  to a form of super-nature. This strategy is \nillustrated in the following three examples. \nBesides its alarm clock function, Remington \u2019s \u201cNature\u2019s clock\u201d, a gadget that was available in  \nthe early to mid-2000s, combined an impressive arra y of techno-natural features, to wit:  \nStart and end your day naturally with light, sound,  and Aromatherapy. Nature's Clock, from \nRemington's Nature Therapy Collection awakens your senses and soothes you to sleep. \nHere's how Nature's Clock light, sound, and Aromath erapy wakes you gently and peacefully: \n30 minutes before the alarm is set to chime, light that simulates sunrise gradually intensifies \n(a buzzer alarm sounds at the end of the 30-minute cycle. Fifteen minutes after \"the sun \nbegins to rise,\" the sounds of songbirds or ocean s urf fills your room. As the light becomes \nbrighter, it releases the aroma of \"Energy\" or \"Mor ning Cafe\" to awaken your senses. At \nnight, light, sound, and Aromatherapy diminish, the n disappear, to lull you to sleep as the \nlight grows dim 30 minutes before bedtime. As the r oom darkens, peaceful sounds of a \nmountain stream or nightfall disappear. The relaxin g aroma of \"Stress Relief\" or \"Calming \nLavender\" slowly fades. 1187  \n \nThe clock is thus designed to imitate the natural b reak of day or nightfall \u2013including sounds \nand smells\u2013 while still providing a chime or the di sputably \u201cnatural\u201d aroma of morning \ncoffee. Even the name \u201cNature\u2019s Clock\u201d represents a  sort of late modern oxymoron or at \n                                                 \n1186  Interestingly, this ad also blurs the distinction between work and leisure since water sports are hig h-tech, \nhigh-risk and high-performance pursuits -a fact rei nforced by the subtle mechanism of the stick. It su ggests that \na person indulging in this type of demanding sport most probably displays competences which are highly  \nvalued in a corporate environment. \n1187  As described on www.amazon.com: http://www.amazon.com/Remington-337676-NC100-Nature s-\nClock/dp/B00006IV3Q . [website accessed Aug. 2011] 278 \n \nleast a clever subterfuge: indeed, the modern techn ological imperative of waking up on time \nis disguised into a cosy compliance with pseudo-nat ural rhythms. \n \nOtherwise, ever heard of \u201cnatural hi-tech\u201d? You may  be thinking of eco-architecture, wind \nturbines or bio-diesel motors\u2026 But, in this case, \u201cn atural hi-tech\u201d is the clever slogan coined \nby cosmetics giant Garnier  to condense a creed that seeks to actively endorse  the blending \nof nature with science and technology, as exemplifi ed by a contemporary ad for a sun cream \nthat combines cactus nutriflavones with a \u201chighly effective\u201d  UVA/UVB filter. 1188  Science and \ntechnology\u2019s takeover of nature is emblematised by the strange ice-cubes featured at the \nbase of the sun cream bottle: bits of cactus have b een captured in the ice like the berry or \ncitrus studded cubes occasionally used as a decorat ive touch in party refreshments. Beyond \nthe cooling promise suggestive of a summer cocktail  for the skin, this layout also symbolises \nthe role of R&D which isolates or freezes \u201cNature\u2019s  Best\u201d in order to create hybrid techno-\nnatural products. This impression is also reinforce d by the visual logo of the brand \u2013a \nmicroscopic close-up of a leaf that suggests that t he secrets of nature have been penetrated \nand appropriated by the scanning gaze of science an d technology. The following statement \nseems to endorse this perception: \u201cGarnier believes in nature as a true source of ins piration \nand care. That's why, using BIOSCREENING, an evalua tion technique used by the \npharmaceutical industry, we screen natural ingredie nts, selecting only those proven to be the \nmost effective.\u201d What seems to not only enable but indeed legitimise  this strategy is \nconsumer subjectivity (at least as it is perceived by the company!): \u201cWith its extensive \nexperience in skincare, Garnier understands that wo men want skin care products that \nstimulate their skin without irritating it. That's why our products combine effectiveness with \npleasurable textures and delicate aromas to ensure a complete feeling of well-being\u201d. 1189  \n \nEven in the organic food realm, where the goodness of nature is usually extolled, it is also \nconsistently sustained and controlled by technology  \u2013as in two instances drawn from health \nfood magazines. In my first source, Zwergenswiese \u2019s \u201cMandel Schmelz\u201d, a savoury almond \nspread, stars in the interaction between a doting a rchetypal German granny and her young \ngrandson. The caption states \u201cAs delicious as in grandmother\u2019s days with roasted  almonds. \nVegetarian, vegan, animal protein and cholesterol f ree\u201d 1190  The second source is a feature \narticle on the Zwergenswiese  company, illustrated with a number of pictures mos tly \nhighlighting the industrial production setting.

Th ese sources aptly illustrate a central \nchallenge in the mediation of contemporary organic food: i.e. guaranteeing the best of both \nworlds. Thanks to a \u201ctraditional-natural\u201d mise en s c\u00e8ne in its advertisements, the organic \nindustry styles itself as the guarantor of nature, emphasising the absence of artificial \npesticides or additives in the food it transforms. But, at the same time, it aligns itself with \nthe fears of a society increasingly obsessed with r isk, be it the risks of industrial pollution or \nthe risks generated by an unbridled nature teeming with germs.  \n \nThe second technically oriented commodification str ategy that I wish to examine is what I \ncall discriminating trivialisation . As the antipole of professionalisation, the trivi alisation of \ntechnology is aptly described by Peter Weingart: \n \nAmongst professional technologies are a few which b ecome \u201cde-professionalised\u201d through \ncommercial dissemination. As a rule, this is only p ossible when they become cheaper, smaller \nand more user-friendly. This hints to the fact that  technologies that have everyday potential \nvirtually display a predetermined development, from  professional use to everyday use and its \ntrivialisation. Probably the most important aspect of this process is that, during the first \nphase, the use of these technologies still requires  the understanding hence also the \nknowledge pertaining to the scientific parts that a re incorporated in them. But this \nunderstanding becomes less and less necessary, and is finally only schematically required for \nusage. 1192   \n \nBy coupling discriminating  with trivialisation , I want to argue that in terms of \ncommodification, trivialisation is a subtle, non-li near negotiation process between producers \n(or mediators) and consumers over issues of blackbo xing and technological expertise. \nTrivialisation  on the producer side means that the high-tech feat ures of products and \nprocesses 1193  are increasingly black-boxed in the name of user-f riendliness (e.g. the \nsophisticated electronic parts of devices such as t he new generation of pulse monitors). On \nthe user side, it implies that these features are i ncreasingly taken for granted and \nassimilated into everyday life (e.g. lay-consumers wearing pulse monitors during their daily \njogging or fitness routines). Discrimination  points to the fact that producers select some \ntechnical features which are supposed to appeal to a demanding consumer (cf. the \nhighlighting of particular health additives in the functional food realm or special features in \nthe fitness appliance field -often extolled in high ly specialised and often obscure and/or \ndeceptive terms). Conversely, from the user perspec tive, consumers make or are construed \nas making reflexive or \u201cconnoisseur\u201d choices betwee n subtly differentiated technical options \n(e.g. privileging a particular type of yogurt bacte ria or a specific Chinese therapeutic \ntreatment). This strategy implies that users are co nstrued as requiring ease and flexibility in \n                                                 \n1192  Weingart, Peter, op.cit., p. 153 : \u201cUnter den professionalisierten Techniken sind ei nige, die durch \nkommerzielle Verbreitung \u201cent-professionalisiert\u201d w erden.

A good instance is \nthat of functional food bars 1194  that are ubiquitously consumed by both professiona l and lay \nsports or fitness practitioners. Functional food ba rs are the result of a relatively recent \ntrivialisation process. One of the forerunners is n o doubt the Ovaltine  snack bar, the so-\ncalled \u201cOvo-Sport\u201d, first launched in Switzerland i n 1937, 1195  however most functional bars \nwhere launched much later in Europe, i.e. in the co urse of the 1980s. Before sports bars \nbecame ubiquitous, most sportspeople in need of a q uick and handy energy boost had to \nmake do with chocolate bars or (dried) fruit. Some (mainly professionals) also resorted to \nspecially designed food supplements that were usual ly sold as powders to be diluted. This \nwas obviously less practical and entailed reliance on professional knowledge embodied by \nthe medical and pharmaceutical establishment or pro fessional trainers and nutrionists \u2013thus \nmore pointedly raising the question of doping. Ther efore, on the one hand, the advent of \nthe standardised functional bar meant that the prod uct was no longer specifically tailored to \nthe individual needs of a particular sportsperson a nd, on the other, it meant that its use was \nno longer professionally \u201ccontrolled\u201d. Sport-specif ic functional ingredients were thus \ntrivialised into functional bars and most (even ver y moderately) sporty individuals have now \nintegrated them into their everyday lives without a ny second thoughts as to appropriate \ndosage of nutrients, timing or regularity of intake , etc.  \n \nBut this is where the discrimination part plays int o this development. A host of functional \nfood bars advertise relatively mainstream ingredien ts such as protein (usually without \nfurther explanations) or additives like fructose, m agnesium or various vitamins and thus do \nnot require extremely specialised knowledge from th e average user. However, the \ndiversification of the offer means that many of the se bars highlight more complex \nsupplements or unusual ingredients. A good example was the so-called \u201cChamp Energy \nPower RX-Biker Bar\u201d ,1196   marketed around the mid-2000s. Both the name and the design of \nthe wrapper made it clear that the biking community  was the prime audience. But even \nmore striking in terms of discrimination, was the f act that it highlighted a particular additive, \nL-carnitine, which is an amino-acid that supports m uscle-building. This was not the only \nfunctional additive included in the bar: the list o f ingredients revealed e.g. magnesium \nhydroxide, pantothenic acid or vitamin B12. But it was this rather obscure additive that was \nhighlighted, without any biochemical or physiologic al explanations being provided on the \npack. It thus hinted to the fact that bikers, as a particular target group, were either in the \nknow 1197  or at least wished to be discriminately addressed as connoisseurs \u2013even if they \nmight not (yet) have internalised the knowledge thu s displayed. Ultimately though, it was \n                                                 \n1194  I am not referring here to a wide range of so-call ed \u201csnack bars\u201d such as chocolate, biscuit, muesli or fruit \nbars that are simply designed and marketed as carbo hydrate snacks to combat low blood sugar during wor k or \nleisure, but to bars that contain specific additive s that are supposed to sustain more specific, usual ly sport-\nrelated, metabolical processes. \n1195  Cf. http://www.wander.ch/ueber_wander/geschichte_in_kue rze/die_wander_produkte.htm  & \nhttp://www.wander.ch/ovomaltineDetail?catId=116&pro dId=42 .

For instance, in order to facilitate the  choice process for consumers, the \ndescriptions of artefacts highlight some technical features \u2013such as HP [horsepower] for \nmotors or W [watts] for amplifiers\u2013 as particularly  relevant while others are left in the dark.  \n \nConsumers, who are neither technical experts nor gu llible fools, thus navigate between the \nwish to positively experience technology (whether i ndividually or collectively) while still \nneeding rational-sounding tools to guide appropriat e choice. Indeed, the subjectively \nexperiential economy still displays its limits in o vertly technical realms. Social pressure is \nsuch that \u201crational-technical\u201d criteria must still be invoked to justify consumption choices. \nHence consumers have to craft their own rationales based on a body (both literal and \nmetaphorical!) of knowledge and experience that is constantly negotiated with other actors \n(i.e. fellow consumers, producers and mediators). U lrich Wengenroth describes this process \nas the central challenge in societies where consume rs (but often also mediators) can no \n                                                 \n1198  This impression was reinforced through the use of the obscure \u201cRX\u201d reference: Rx can be used as e.g. an \nabbreviation for \u201creceive\u201d in radio jargon or for \u201c rallycross\u201d in the field of auto-racing or as a sym bol for \nprescription drugs . Cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rx  & http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rx . In this context, the \n\u201crallycross\u201d reference seems to be the most plausib le in order to add a \u201csporty touch\u201d but it may also  just be \nempty techno-talk, i.e. a so-called \u201cfloating signi fier\u201d (a term originally coined by L\u00e9vi Strauss, Cl aude [in \n\u201cIntroduction \u00e0 l'oeuvre de Marcel Mauss\u201d in Marcel  Mauss, Sociologie et anthropologie,  Paris: Presses \nUniversitaires de France, 1968] but taken up by a n umber of language theorists, Jean Baudrillard inclu ded). \n[websites accessed Aug. 2011] \n1199  Schimank actually uses the term \u201cdecision society\u201d  [Entscheidungsgesellschaft], echoing in that a Ger man \nsociological trend launched by Ulrich Beck with his  \u201crisk society\u201d [Risikogesellschaft], and taken up e.g. by \nGerhard Schulze with his \u201cexperience society\u201d [Erle bnisgesellschaft], etc. Cf.

Our \u201cgood reasons\u201d for or \nagainst particular consumer goods are neither subje ctive nor objective, they are both, since \nthey must be perceived as objective. The historical process of rapid techn ologisation is \nescorted by a process of \u201cadapted rationality\u201d. 1201  \n \nIt is this tightrope act between subjective and obj ective criteria that enables HLT consumers \nto compromise between a vision of health that requi res a \u201crational\u201d investment in a body \nenvisaged as a \u201cbio-share\u201d 1202  and a holistic perspective that sees the sensuous,  emotional \nand experiential needs of body as guiding consumer choice. \n \nA product line I discovered at a discounter where I  sometimes shopped between 2005 and \n2010 provides a convincing example of this strategy . At the time, the new convenience \nassortment was called \u201cViva Vital: eating and drinking with pleasure and reason\u201d  and was \ndescribed as a programme for \u201chealthy bon vivants\u201d 1203  \u2013thus pointedly illustrating the type \nof \u201crational hedonism\u201d that permeates the discourse  around most HLTs. This product line \nwas based on considerations very similar to the one s I evoked when describing Dr Strunz\u2019s \n\u201cgospel\u201d in the \u201cCommodification\u201d section of Chapte r 3 ( Theory ): i.e. the assortment \nincluded a lot of \u201chigh-quality\u201d protein, mainly le an poultry, ham, salmon and tuna, lean \ncheese and yogurt specialties, 1204  various blends of deep-frozen vegetables, green an d white \nteas, ready-made soups and TV or work dinners, brea kfast cereals, olive oil, etc. While most \nproducts could not be labelled as functional (they contained no added vitamins, minerals or \nother supposedly health-enhancing ingredients), man y of them boasted a very detailed \nNutrition Facts  table besides the compulsory ingredients list. The  table provided the habitual \ninformation on kcal, protein, carbohydrates and fat  contents (i.e. 100g contain on average\u2026) \nbut also, whenever appropriate, the percentage of s ugar within the carbohydrates, a \nsubdivision between the types of fat (saturated, mo no-unsaturated, poly-unsaturated), as \n                                                 \n1201  Wengenroth, Ulrich, \u201eGute Gr\u00fcnde: Technisierung un d Konsumentscheidungen\u201c, Technikgeschichte , Band \n71, Heft 1, 2004, pp. 3-18, p. 18. \u201cMit Rationalit\u00e4tsfiktionen haben sich hoch-technis ierte Gesellschaften das \nMittel geschaffen, auf den Anspruch rationaler und zugleich nachvollziehbarer Entscheidungen nicht zu \nverzichten.

When lean, it represents an important cont ribution to a contemporary diet\u201d 1207 ; the \nrationale for eating \u201cdeep frozen soft peas\u201d  was that \u201cPeas naturally contain a lot of vitamin \nC, vitamin B1 and folic acid\u201d 1208 ; it also made sense to grab a \u201cFresh & spicy Thai soup with \nchicken\u201d  because \u201cFat-reduced Thai soup is an ideal quick meal in th e context of a modern \ndiet\u201d 1209 ; finally \u201cLight fruit yogurt \u2013 strawberry & lime\u201d  could not be dispensed with since \n\u201cyogurt exclusively sweetened with fructose is reco mmended for a conscious management of \ncarbohydrates\u201d. 1210   \n \nThese five examples should have made it clear that there is an implicit consensus between \nproducers and consumers about certain \u201ctechnical\u201d r eferences and values that should \nenable consumers to embrace a more healthful diet. The blurbs pre-suppose that consumers \nare aware of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d proteins, carbohydrat es and fats as well as of the need for \ncertain vitamins and minerals. But the information remains anecdotic, anchored to a few \nsignifieds that are more connotative than denotativ e. Indeed, average consumers are \nseldom aware of the exact effect of mono- and poly- unsaturated fats on their coronary \nmetabolism. However, for health-obsessed customers,  who might be tempted to scan the \n                                                 \n1205  RDA stands for \u201cRecommended Dietary/Daily Allowanc e\u201d and was introduced in the U.S. in 1941.

For instance, on the side of the \nstrawberry-lime yogurt pot, one could read: \u201cFruit yogurt: yogurt provides the body with \nhigh-quality protein. By replacing traditional whit e sugar with fructose obtained from apples, \nthe metabolism is less affected by carbohydrates th at influence blood sugar. The intestinal \nflora is positively influenced by dietary fibre in the shape of oligofructose.\u201d 1211   Nevertheless, \neven this additional information focused on limited , rather basic common references: i.e. \nblood sugar = bad (diabetes connotation), fibre = g ood (prevents constipation). And there \nwere no explanations about what makes protein high- quality or about the exact nature of \noligofructose and its action in the intestine.  \n \nThus, discriminating trivialisation and rationality  constructs have much in common and can \nbe seen as complementary strategies (and interpreta tive tools) for the actors involved in \nmarketing and consumption. They both presuppose tha t, in the case of specific technological \ninvestments, the experiential dimension is not the only determinant of choice but that there \nis a strong societal pressure to purchase appliance s and services with a certain amount of \n\u201crational\u201d discernment. Furthermore, they both pres uppose that there is a negotiation \nprocess between the various actors on the market: i ndeed if a technology is to have selling \npotential, there must be criteria upon which the va rious parties can agree. However, in the \ncase of rationality constructs , I would argue that the aim is mainly to level the  playing field \nbetween actors: i.e. an agreement is reached as to what are the significant \ncharacteristics/criteria that make a \u201crational\u201d com parison possible. In contrast, \ndiscriminating trivialisation  seems to imply that beyond user-friendliness and e asy \ndomestication, the user\u2019s \u201cspecialised\u201d knowledge b ase is being specifically courted by \nproducers (or mediators). Implicitly, the latter ar e flattering \u201cclever\u201d consumers by telling \nthem \u201cwe know that you know what we\u2019re talking about...\u201d , even if both parties may be \nperfectly aware of the limits of this type of techn ospeak.     \n \nFinally, the last commodification strategy I want t o discuss is individual consumer \nempowerment , a strategy that transcends all the previous ones in that its aim is to \nencourage consumer initiative and responsibility. I t is typified by a new generation of \nadvertising slogans (and more generally discourse) that emphasise consumers\u2019 sovereignty, \nself-worth, intelligence, discernment, creativity, decisional power, etc. \u2013in short, it caters to \na host of emotional \u201creinforcement\u201d needs. This typ e of strategy is not found solely in the \nHLT realm but is disseminated alongside a wide rang e of products and services. They \nembody a shift from an object  (product) to a subject  (consumer) orientation, i.e. it is no \nlonger the virtues of the product that are cast cen tre-stage but those of the consumer. \nTherefore, two modes dominate: either an affirmatio n in the first person such as L\u2019Or\u00e9al \u2019s \nfamous \u201cBecause I\u2019m worth it\u201d 1212  (mirrored by the German slogans of Media Markt : \u201cHey, \nI\u2019m not an idiot\u201d , Visa : \u201cI\u2019ll take the liberty\u201d  or SAT.1 : \u201cI watch what I want\u201d ). 1213  The second \nmode \u2013often an imperative\u2013 seeks to admonish, encou rage or \u201cgive permission\u201d. Prime \ninstance are Garnier \u2019s \u201cTake Care\u201d  or Viva Vital \u2019s more emphatic \u201cTake good care of \nyourself\u201d . Other examples include Nike\u2019s famous \u201cJust do it\u201d  and Apple\u2019s no less famous  \n                                                 \n1211  From the yogurt carton: \u201eFruchtjoghurt: Joghurt versorgt den K\u00f6per mit hoch ertigem Eiwei\u00df.

Some products even play on \nboth first and second person registers. Du Darfst  [you may!], a low-cal food line discussed in \nChapter 5 ( Food case-study ), is particularly emblematic since the brand name itself \nrepresents a permission. From the 1980s onwards, it  was supplemented by slogans such as \n\u201cI want to stay as I am\u201d  or \u201cI don\u2019t want to hesitate for too long\u201d  \u2013this in the context of \nchoosing the right foods in the supermarket, thus h eralding the rationality constructs \ndiscussed above. 1215  \n \nHowever, these types of affirmations and recommenda tions remain rather vague about the \nmeans to secure or fulfil them. This is because, on  the one hand, the consumer is now seen \nas publicity-literate (or \u201csubtle\u201d) enough to make the link between the slogan and the \nproduct, and, on the other hand, these slogans are ultimately \u201clifestyle rules\u201d that imply a \ngeneral consciousness shift. Consumers are therefor e invited to pay more attention to their \nneeds and emotions as well as to capitalise on thei r cognitive skills. Even though these \nslogans encapsulate diverse forms of individual \u201cem powerment\u201d, their gist is that consumers \nmust be reminded that their attitudes ultimately de termine the success of the product or \nservice. Thus, to a large extent, contemporary adve rtising has moved away from modern \nadvertising that sought to make consumers uneasy, i nadequate or even emotionally insecure \n\u2013\u201cconstantly monitoring themselves for bodily [or o ther] imperfections\u201d , as Mike \nFeatherstone puts it. 1216  Instead of a guilt-trip, this new type of publicit y offers consumers an \nego-trip. This makes sense in an experience economy  where, as noted higher, \ncommodification requires consumers\u2019 self-confidence , proactive participation and \nresponsibilisation to actually bring the goods and services alive. Indeed, it is their \n\u201cengineering\u201d expertise that is needed to seal the success of the recombinance ethic. Thus \nto refine or extend Bourdieusian  categories, 1217  I would contend that increased \ncommodification meets with a diversification of per sonal capital types. The original \neconomic, social, cultural, symbolic (and physical)1218  capitals consumers are supposedly \nendowed with (or cultivate) are complemented by emo tional and experiential capitals that \nmay be reinforced (or diminished) by the original c ategories but may also develop \nindependently. \n \n                                                 \n1214  Garnier: \u201eDenk an Dich\u201c; Viva Vital: \u201eLassen Sie es sich gut gehen\u201c ; Skoda: \u201eSeien Sie vern\u00fcnftig. H\u00f6ren Sie \nauch mal auf Ihren Bauch\u201c . The Saab, Siemens and Fun Factory slogans are quo ted in the English original. \n1215  Du Darfst: \u201eIch will so bleiben wie ich bin\u201c  or \u201eIch will nicht lange \u00fcberlegen\u201c .  \n1216  Mike Featherstone, \u201cThe Body in Consumer Culture\u201d,  The Body: Social Process and Cultural Theory , Eds Eds \nMike Featherstone, Mike Hepworth, and Bryan S. Turn er, London: Sage, 1991, p. 175. \n1217  Cf. Bourdieu, Pierre, La distinction : critique sociale du jugement , op. cit. \n1218  Personally, at this stage of my study, I would ten d to single out and emphasise embodied capital more  than \nBourdieu who originally subsumed it under \u201ccultural  capital\u201d. Indeed, in contemporary westernised soci ety, \n\u201cbio-cultural\u201d resources located in the body \u2013inclu ding health, fitness, beauty and/or sex-appeal\u2013 hav e become \nalmost as influential as e.g. social capital on the  habitus of late modern consumers. Cf. Shilling, Ch ris, The Body \nand Social Theory , op.cit.; Shilling, Chris, \u201cEducating the body: Ph ysical capital and the production of social \ninequalities\u201d, op. cit. & Shilling, Chris, \u201cThe bod y, class and social inequalities\u201d, Equality, Education and Physical \nEducation, Ed. John Evans, London: Falmer Press, 1993.  286 \n \nThrough the analysis of the above dimensions, I hav e thus tried to show how \ncommodification under the guise of recombinance has  led to a multitude of strategies to \nfragment, diversify, combine, multiply, hybridise, popularise, specialise, etc. the offer of \ngoods and services in general and of HLTs in partic ular. The aptness of the recombinance \nmetaphor for HLTs is particularly striking because its genetic origins are reflected in more \nmacro body management strategies. Not just genes, b ut body parts are singled out \n(isolation ) for specific treatment: e.g. foot cream and hand cream or butt and belly toning \ngym routines. Bodies and body parts are also target ed for multiple treatments \n(multiplication ): for example, the face is no longer just washed a nd coated with cream but \nmay be submitted to a programme involving sauna, ex foliation, toning, massage, \nmoisturising etc. Moreover, bodies are the focus of  a wide array of hybrid and/or creolised \n(hybridisation and creolisation ) practices, such as e.g. Tae Bo 1219  or the Grinberg method. 1220  \n \nAdditionally, as we saw in the \u201cUnder the sign of t he body\u201d section of Chapter 3 ( Theory ), \nbodies and body parts are also saturated with cultu rally shaped signs that change cyclically \n(semiotisation and resemiotisation ). Indeed, the sizes, textures and shapes of bodies  and \nbody parts can spell in turn youth, beauty, fashion  and health or ugliness, has-been, \npathology and obsolescence. The \u201cTechnology\u201d sectio n in the same chapter also uncovered \nhow bodies are more and more consciously shaped thr ough the enrolment of both nature \nand technology ( techno-naturalisation ). And one can also argue that bodies and their \nfunctions are discriminately trivialised and ration ally constructed ( discriminating \ntrivialisation and rationality constructs ). To wit, the meaning and significance of particul ar \nphysiological processes or metabolical markings is regularly (re-)negotiated between health \nproducers and health consumers. For instance, chole sterol, blood sugar, serotonin or \nintestinal flora \u2013whether in excess or lacking\u2013 bec ome graspable emblems of multifarious \nand multicausal civilisation diseases (such as coro nary complaints, diabetes, depression or \nintestinal malfunction) that warrant particular pre ventive or healing measures. And just as \nthese processes or markings can build bridges, they  can also segregate those consumers who \ndo not have a clue from those who are aware of thei r photosensitivity, their aerobic and \nanaerobic capacities or their (auto-)immune reactio ns. Finally, bodies are increasingly seen \nas endowed with new cognitive skills, holistic apti tudes and responsibilities ( individual \nconsumer empowerment ) that should enable them to steer their own course  into conscious \nhealth.  \n \nHowever this embodied empowerment to make the right  health choices may prove \nproblematic. Indeed, even if as Frank Furedi writes , \u201c[...] the self enjoys an important moral \nstatus\u201d  and this status is reinforced by the fact that \u201cpopular culture communicates the \nmessage that wider external demands are illegitimat e if in some sense they thwart individual \n                                                 \n1219  Tae Bo [Total Awareness Excellent Body Obedience] is  \u201ca form of high impact aerobics that combines the \nmoves of Tae Kwon Do, karate, boxing, ballet, and h ip_hop dancing\u201d , cf.

[website originally accessed Aug. 2006]   287 \n \nrealisation,\u201d 1221  the embodied self, despite increasing individualis ation, is still embedded in \nan influential social order:  \n \nIt is for profoundly social  reasons that we\u2019ve directed so much attention to o ur bodies in the \n1970s and 1980s. The body boom may look  individualistic, but in this case looks are \ndeceiving. To be sure, the decision to have cosmeti c surgery or to lift weights is made by an \nindividual, and some of the pathologies of the age,  such as exercise addiction and anorexia, \nare borne by individuals. But changes in society ar e very much implicated. As women\u2019s roles \nshifted, eating disorders became more common; as Am erica sought to regain its might after \nthe Vietnam War, the musclebound look grew popular.1222    \n \nIn the new moral economy of health characteristic o f westernised societies, pursuing healthy \nembodied consciousness is an opportunity that is gr adually becoming a constraint coded \ninto a new \u2013and yet not so new\u2013 moral discourse. 1223  Elisabeth Mixa, in her forthcoming \nstudy on wellness, defines it as a neoliberal, hege monic propriety discourse \n[Anstandsdiskurs ] that creates new relations to the self. 1224   \n \nEven if by means of the recombinance modality, this  moral discourse appears to comfortably \nabsorb and contain a number of \u201cobjective\u201d dualitie s previously perceived as irreconcilable \nsuch as nature vs. technology or body vs. mind, it actually reinforces \u201csubjective\u201d dualities \nsuch as good vs. bad, healthy vs. sick or decent vs . indecent. Ironically the criteria used to \ndetermine between these poles are no longer drawn f rom religious dogma but cloaked in a \nmantle of scientific or technological rationales. A s Barry Glassner puts it, this development is \nfar from new since: \n \nNearly a hundred years ago the social theorist Emil e Durkheim saw that judgements of right \nor wrong were coming to be based on the findings of  scientists rather than on the teachings \nof religious leaders or philosophers. He also noted  that moral acts were increasingly viewed \nby people not as dictates from on high but as choic es made freely and based on their \ninformed belief that such acts were in their own be st interest. Over the course of the \ntwentieth century, a true remoralizing of our cultu re has taken place in the name of science \nand personal choice. Ironically, in the process we\u2019 ve reverted to some of the least appealing \nbeliefs found in so-called primitive societies. For  example, many Americans now accept the \n                                                 \n1221  Cf. Furedi, Frank, Therapy Culture , London & New York: Routledge, 2003, p. 147. \n1222  Cf.

Wellness: Von heilsamer Lustbarkeit und Postsexualit\u00e4t , Bielefeld: \nTranscript, 2011, forthcoming. Mixa perceives the p aradisiacal narratives and images of wellness as \nparticipating in a form of post-modern fairy tale p romoting an eternally beautiful life. In the wake o f clear \ntransformation processes, in which emotions are res haped and are more strongly therapeutically treated , \nespecially by coaches, she diagnoses that a feminis ation of culture runs parallel with a depoliticisat ion, an \nerosion of the social, a dissolution into self-refe rentiality. In her own words, drawn from an abstrac t she kindly \nsent to me, she pursues: \u201eEs kann von Wellness als einem Diskurs gesprochen werden, in welchem ein neu \nentstehendes Wohlf\u00fchl-Dispositiv jenes der Sexualit \u00e4t zu \u00fcberlagern beginnt. In endlosen Selbst-Gest\u00e4n dnissen \nbeichten wir \u00f6ffentlich oder insgeheim unsere Vers\u00e4 umnisse, uns etwas Gutes getan zu haben. An den R\u00e4n dern \ndes Wellness-Diskurses finden wir Ausgegrenztes: St ress, emotionale Ersch\u00f6pfung, Panik und Traurigkeit , auch \ndas Unverm\u00f6gen, uns wie ein vern\u00fcnftiger Mensch wel lness-konform zu verhalten. Dieser neue Wahnsinn \n(Greco) besteht vor allem darin, sich eben nicht wo hl verhalten verhalten zu haben.\u201c .   288 \n \nnotion that a person becomes ill not because of nat ural physical processes but because of \nimmoral action. 1225  \n \nThrough the lense of medicalisation, Peter Conrad a lso perceives a long history of morality \nconnected with health. He contends that especially the medicalisation of deviance, such as \ne.g. alcoholism, has reinforced the secular connect ion between morality and health, \nhighlighting the transition from sin to disease, vi a moral weakness, without completely \neffacing the negative connotation of the condition.  And through healthicization, the unwell \nbody moves in the opposite direction \u2013from being ju st sick to weak-willed before becoming \ndownright indecent or sinful: 1226  \n \nWith medicalization, medical definitions and treatm ents are offered for previous social \nproblems or natural events; with healthicization, b ehavioral and social definitions are \nadvanced for previously biomedically defined events  (e.g. heart disease). Medicalization \nproposes biomedical causes and interventions; healt hicization proposes lifestyle and \nbehavioral causes and interventions. One turns the moral into the medical, the other turns \nhealth into the moral. 1227   \n \nThis new morality of health draws its power from it s inescapability, which functions both at \nthe societal and individual levels. In institutiona l terms, as Peter Conrad and Diana Walsh \ncontend, health promotion appears unassailable, \u201cOn a deeper level, though, health can be \nviewed as a moral discourse that reflects particula r, deeply ingrained values and \nconsequently can be used as a legitimating vocabula ry for instituting changes that might \notherwise be resisted.\u201d 1228  In chapter 4 ( History ), we have witnessed how in the world of \nwork the pursuit of health can be instrumentalised to instigate potentially very far-reaching \nsocial controls. In the professional realm though, one can argue that freedom of individual \nchoice is limited: choices are forestructured by th e limited offer at hand and the more or less \ncoercive incentives built around them.  \n \nTherefore, it is in the individual (or leisure) rea lm that healthicisation attains its ambivalent \npotential since health consumption appears truly vo luntary and desirable in a sphere \ncharacterised by an abundance of choices and accomp anying incentives. However, individual \nhealthicisation has become so pervasive that, as a consumer \u2013be it a Wholefoods  \nworshipper, a Danone  sceptic or even an \u201camoral hedonist\u201d feeding on ha mburgers and \nchocolate\u2013 I cannot avoid  making health-connotated decisions, hence position ing myself in \nthis new moral economy. Furthermore, \u201cthe proof of the pudding is in the eating\u201d so to \nspeak since my body is bound to faithfully mirror ( or betray) my healthful or not so healthful \nchoices. Indeed, as Gunther Gebauer argues, previou sly \u201cSocial rank was like a garment \ntossed over the shoulder; the external disclosed wh at was inside. But the body\u2019s actual \ncontours were not so important; more important was the spirit who filled it\u201d  but now \u201cIt is \nnot possible for an athletic spirit to sit inside a  non-athletic body. Just like a health-conscious \nattitude and an athletic lifestyle, the spirit assu mes a direct physical form; it embodies \n                                                 \n1225  Cf. Glassner, Barry,  Bodies: overcoming the tyranny of perfection , op. cit., p. 247.

Ironically  but significantly, the vocabulary \npreviously used to evaluate moral character has bee n recuperated to assess embodied \npersonality and behaviour. In their interviews of f itness or wellness participants, Glassner, \nConrad and Maguire 1231  were confronted again and again with the discursiv e embodiments \nof the new health morality. Participants spoke in q uasi-religious terms of their own as well as \nothers\u2019 \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d behaviours and of the bala ncing act required to compensate the \nbad with enough good:  \n \n[...] the fitness field reproduces the tension \u2013 ty pical of consumer culture more broadly \u2013 \nbetween indulgence and restraint. This cultural amb ivalence is expressed in the simultaneous \nincrease of consumption of both fatty and diet food s (Nestle 2002), exercise classes and \ntelevision, miles spent on the treadmill and in the  car. The problem with fitness, from the \npoint of view of health, is that the field\u2019s prescr ibed negotiation of denial and pleasure \nproduces not healthy but consuming behaviour. 1232  \n \nThis tension between consumption-oriented indulgenc e and restraint is most appropriately \nillustrated by the psychological concept of \u201cmoral licensing\u201d, which could be defined as a \nsort of moral budgeting, in which individuals more or less consciously engage in order to \nbalance their negative intentions and actions with positive counterparts (and vice versa). 1233  \n                                                 \n1229  Gebauer, Gunther, Gebauer, Gunther, \u201cOn the Role o f Everyday Physical-Fitness Sports in Our Times\u201d, \nFitness as cultural phenomenon , op. cit., p. 88.

Thus, people tend to be strongly motivate d to engage in prosocial and ethical behaviours if their moral \nself is threatened by a recent transgression; they are least likely to scrutinize the moral implicatio ns of their \nbehaviors and to regulate their behaviors right aft er their moral self has experienced a boost from a good deed. 290 \n \nThis means that not only is the socio-economic envi ronment a powerful influence on \ndecision-making but also the personal history of co nsumers: \u201cPeople do not make decisions \nin a vacuum; their decisions are embedded in a hist ory of behaviors.\u201d 1234  Thus an avowed \nstriving for health is most likely to be regularly undermined by consumers\u2019 moral calculations \n\u2013along the lines of a pint of ice-cream to reward o neself for a 5-mile jog or a 5-mile jog to \npunish oneself for guzzling a pint of ice-cream.   \n \nTo conclude, my study has, I hope, convincingly dem onstrated that beyond the almost \nimmeasurable pervasiveness of healthful technologie s and the staggering range of their \nrecombined incarnations \u2013indicative of a previously  undreamed of feasibility\u2013 the highly \nambivalent sign of the body remains a truly elusive  salvation for consciously embodied \nconsumers.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                         \nThis implies that virtuous acts can license subsequ ent asocial and unethical behaviors.\u201d  Cf. also Meritt, Anna C., \nEffron, Daniel A. & Monin, Beno\u00eet, \u201cMoral Self-Lice nsing: When Being Good Frees Us to Be Bad\u201d,  Social and \nPersonality Psychology Compass, 4/5, 2010, pp. 344-357, available online here: http://www-\npsych.stanford.edu/~monin/ .

Themes were resolutely contemporary (e.g. a ppropriate nutrition, fitness, stress \nmanagement, seasonal advice, etc.), the information  neatly laid out and communicated. In \nmy opinion, Freundin  or F\u00fcr Sie  are the two magazines that best compare with prima  in \nterms of readership. The emphasis in these magazine s was/is mainly on mastering the \nchallenges of everyday life, while including light entertainment. Intellectually, it was more \ndemanding than magazines such as Bunte  or Frau im Spiegel  but not as ambitious as Brigitte .  \n \nCurrent information \nThe magazine is no longer in print. It has proved v ery difficult to obtain trustworthy \ninformation on the dissemination of the magazine an d the profile of its readership, since the \nKlambt Gruppe has not replied to my query. I have t hus had to rely on a lacunar collage of \nvarious sources. It seems that it was first launche d in 1986 [I do not know when it was \ndiscontinued though] maybe by the Gruner & Jahr Ver lag [??] before being taken over by the 293 \n \nVerlagsgruppe Klambt [??]. A model for this magazin e seems to have been the homonymous \nFrench magazine founded by Gruner & Jahr editor Axe l Ganz in 1982. Otherwise, I was able \nto cull the following information from a comparison  made between prima and Vogue \nBusiness by Birgit Lawerenz. In March 2003 [date of  the comparison], 64,701 issues \u00e0 64 \npages were printed, the price per issue was \u20ac1.65, the magazine was published once every 2 \nmonths: \u201eDie Zeitschrift prima \u00e4hnelt den Allgemeinen Zeits chriften hinsichtlich \nThemenvielfalt  und breiter Zielgruppe. Die Besonderheit ist demnac h vor allem die \nzweimonatliche Erscheinungsweise und damit zusammen h\u00e4ngende inhaltliche \nKonsequenzen. [\u2026] Der Titel prima ist zun\u00e4chst unge w\u00f6hnlich, da er weder die Zielgruppe \nnoch Inhalte n\u00e4her kl\u00e4rt, wie die meisten Frauentit el. Er symbolisiert eine positive \nLebenseinstellung nach dem Motto \u201aFrau sein ist pri ma\u2018. Laut Selbstdarstellung bietet das \nHeft eine bunte Mischung aus Unterhaltung, Rat und Information. [\u2026] prima ist teurer als \nw\u00f6chentliche Frauenzeitschriften gleichen Umfanges [\u2026] Prima zielt auf eher j\u00fcngere Frauen \nzwischen 20 und 49 Jahren und beschreibt diese als modern und selbstbewusst. [\u2026] In prima \nschneiden die vielf\u00e4ltigen Inhalte alle Rubriken an . Viele Texte haben einen \nRatgebercharakter. Artikel zu Liebe und Leben nehme n den gr\u00f6\u00dften Anteil ein: (22 \nLiebeskiller; Do\u2019s und dont\u2019s im Liebesleben; die L iebesleben-Fallen; Tipps gegen \nLiebeskummer; Strategien gegen Sch\u00fcchternheit) An n \u00e4chster Stelle kommen Aussehen, \nGesundheit, K\u00fcche und gleich zwei Horoskope: ein no rmales und eines f\u00fcr das richtige \nUrlaubsziel. [\u2026] Bei prima ist der Anteil der Werbu ng auff\u00e4llig gering. Eine Seite wirbt f\u00fcr ein \nAbonnement.
