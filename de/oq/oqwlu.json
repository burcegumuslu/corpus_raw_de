A common fall scenario is loss of balance during an emergency braking maneuver to avoid another vehicle [5-7]. Automated Vehicles (AV) have the potential to prevent these critical scenarios between bicycle and cars. However, current Threat Assessment Algorithms (TAA) used by AVs only consider collision avoidance to decide upon safe gaps and decelerations when interacting wih cyclists and do not consider bicycle specific balance-related constraints. To date, no studies have addressed this risk of falls in safety critical scenarios. Yet, given the bicycle dynamics, we hypothesized that the existing TAA may be inaccurate in predicting the threat of cyclist falls and misclassify unsafe interactions. To test this hypothesis, this study developed a simple Newtonian mechanics-based model that calculates the performance of two existing TAAs in four critical scenarios with two road conditions. Tue four scenarios are: (1) a crossing scenario and a bicycle following lead car scenario in which the car either (2) suddenly braked, (3) halted or (4) accelerated from standstill. These scenarios have been identified by bicycle-car conflict studies as common scenarios where the car driver elicits an emergency braking response of the cyclist [8-11] and are illustrated in Figure 1. The two TAAs are Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Headway (H). These TAAs are commonly used by AVs in the four critical scenarios that will be modelled. The two road conditions are a flat dry road and also a downhill wet road, which serves as a worst-case condition for loss of balance during emergency braking [12].\n- Freie Schlagw\u00f6rter (DE)\n- Sicherheit von Radfahrern, Auto-Fahrrad-Konflikte, Sturzrisiko, Algorithmen zur Gefahrenbewertung, automatisierte Fahrzeuge\n- Freie Schlagw\u00f6rter (EN)\n- cycling safety, car-bicycle conflicts, fall risk, threat assessment algorithms, automated vehicles\n- Publizierende Institution\n- Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, 'Friedrich List' Faculty of Transport and Traffic Sciences, Institute of Transport Planning and Road Traffic\n- URN Qucosa\n[urn:nbn:de:bsz:14-qucosa2-824605](https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:14-qucosa2-824605)\n- Ver\u00f6ffentlichungsdatum Qucosa\n- 19.12.2022\n- Dokumenttyp\n- Konferenzbeitrag\n- Sprache des Dokumentes\n- Englisch\n- Lizenz / Rechtehinweis\n[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": [null, "/", "/", "/landing-page/#skip2content", "/landing-page/#skip2nav", "/impressum/", null, "https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:14-qucosa2-824605", "/id/qucosa:81360", "https://doi.org/10.25368/2022.425", "https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:14-qucosa2-824605", "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "https://tud.qucosa.de/api/qucosa%3A82460/attachment/ATT-0/", "https://tud.qucosa.de/nutzungshinweise-fuer-die-digitalen-objekte-in-qucosa/", "/landing-page/", "/landing-page/", null, null, "/", "/ueber-qucosa/", "/recherche/", "/veroeffentlichen/", "/faq/", "/impressum/", "/datenschutzerklaerung/", "http://www.qucosa.de/typo3/", "/landing-page/?L=0", "/landing-page/https%3A%2F%2Ftud.qucosa.de%2Fapi%2Fqucosa%253A82460%2Fmets/?L=0", "/en/landing-page/", "/landing-page/https%3A%2F%2Ftud.qucosa.de%2Fapi%2Fqucosa%253A82460%2Fmets/?L=1", "http://www.dini.de/", "https://www.slub-dresden.de/"]}
