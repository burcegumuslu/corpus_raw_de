Modifiable \nDTrSE , including poor physical and cognitive function , impairments of balance and gait and  \njoin-pain, were found to be associated with falls, regardless of age1,2. There is a lack of \nknowledge whether cancer -related fatigue (CrF) ha s an impact on gait performance and thus on \nsusceptibility to fall. The refore, t his study examined the association between number of falls \nduring the last 12 month and CrF  in patients (pts) with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), \nwho are frequently affected by CrF.  \nMethods:  This was a cross -sectional study  using  multicenter based survey data. Multinomial \nlogistic regression sex stratified analys is, were used to investigate the association between \ndetermine if CrF and number of falls  (None = reference group , 1 fall, > 1  fall). DTrSE  such as  \nCrF, concentration  problems , and bone pain were measured using single items from MPN \nSymptom Assessment Form3, ranging between 0 ( absent ) to 100 ( worst imaginable ). Analys is \nwere adjusted  for potential effects of healt h-related quality of life, body mass index, MPN \nsubtype  (chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and \nmyelofibrosis), age, and school education  (\u2264 10 vs. > 10 years) .  Results:  The final sample comprised  688 pts (mean age 57.4 \u00b1 13.8, 62,4  % female , 43.5 % \u2264 \n10 years of schooling ). Falls  occurred at a rate of 16.2 % in women compared to 12.2 % in men  \n(p = .153) . There was no difference between females and males in terms of CrF between \nindividual with more than 1 fall , whereas females with 1 fall had a  higher  CrF compared to those \nwithout a fall (RRR  = 1.019; 95%CI  1.002; 1.039), respectively.  \nConclusion:  More than one in ten pts reported at least 1 fall within the last 12 month s. Women \nseem to be more susceptible to fall than men. The association between CrF and occurrence of  a \nfall was significant for women but not for men . More research should be done to extend the \nevidence for exercise training to reduce falls in pts with cancer . \n \nReference s: \n1Champbell G et al, Rehabil Nurs.  2018;43(4):201 -2013  \n2Basal C et al, Support Care Cancer  2019;27(6):2195 -2202  \n3Scherber R  et a, Blood  2011; 118(2):401 \u2013408 \n \n \nFelser, S., Gube, M., Richter, K., Gruen, J., le Cout re, P., Schulze, S., Muegge, L.O., Junghanss, C.
