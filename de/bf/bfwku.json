Failures that led to the loss of minipins as mucositis, mobility or rootperforation were observed in 23.7% (n = 25) cases. 9 of 14 (8,5%) miniimplants were lost in case of mucositis , 8 of 10 (7.5%)in case of mobility,a rootperforation occurred in only one case.rnThe only miniscrew implanted lingually in the mandible was lost. Palatal miniimplants in the maxilla failed in two of four cases. The failure rate of vestibular implantation was 3.8% (n = 4) for the upper jaw and 15.1% (n = 16) for the mandible. The survival rate of the implantation in \"attached\" gingiva was with 83.3% (n = 72) higher than in \"not-attaches\" gingiva.rnThe immediate loading of orthodontic miniscrews appears to be a workable concept.\n610 Medical sciences", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["#content", "https://ub.uni-mainz.de", "#", "/mydspace", "/profile", "#", "/advanced-search", "/community-list", "/browse?type=author", "/browse?type=title", "/browse?type=dateissued", "/browse?type=dateavailable", "/browse?type=subject", "/browse?type=type", "/browse?type=department", "#", "https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/1636?locale=en", "https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/1636?locale=de", "#", "/help-faq", "/help-research", "/help-faq-search", "/help-publish", "https://www.ub.uni-mainz.de/de/dissertationen", "/contact", "/", "/handle/20.500.12030/1", "/handle/20.500.12030/2", "/browse?type=author&value=Portmann%2C+Platon", "https://ror.org/023b0x485", "http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-1634", "https://nbn-resolving.org/urn/resolver.pl?urn=nbn:de:hebis:77-21930", "https://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/", "/handle/20.500.12030/2", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/1636/1/2193.pdf", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/1636/1/2193.pdf", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/1636/1/2193.pdf", "/handle/20.500.12030/1636?mode=full", "/handle/20.500.12030/1636/statistics", "/imprint", "/privacy", "/contact", "/guidelines", "https://doi.org/10.18452/24678", "https://www.uni-mainz.de/"]}
