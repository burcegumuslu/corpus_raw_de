It is well established that various sensory systems contribute to the regulation of balance. However, it is still unclear which role each individual sensory system (e.g. plantar mechanoreceptors) plays in balance regulation. This becomes also evident in various patient populations, for instance in diabetics with reduced plantar sensitivity. To investigate these sensory mechanisms, approaches like hypothermia to deliberately reduce plantar afferent input have been applied. But there are some limitations regarding hypothermic procedures in previous studies: Not only plantar aspects of the feet might be affected and maintaining the hypothermic effect during data collection. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to induce a permanent and controlled plantar hypothermia and to examine its effects on anticipatory and compensatory balance responses. We hypothesized deteriorations in anticipatory and compensatory balance responses as increased center of pressure excursions (COP) and electromyographic activity (EMG) in response to the hypothermic plantar procedure. 52 healthy and young subjects (23.6 \u00b1 3.0 years) performed balance tests (unexpected perturbations). Subjects\u2019 foot soles were exposed to three temperatures while standing upright: 25, 12 and 0 \u00b0C. COP and EMG were analyzed during two intervals of anticipatory and one interval of compensatory balance responses (intervals 0, 1 and 2, respectively). Results Similar plantar temperatures confirmed the successful implementation of the thermal platform. No significant COP and EMG differences were found for the anticipatory responses (intervals 0 and 1) under the hyperthermia procedure. Parameters in interval 2 showed generally decreased values in response to cooling. Conclusion No changes in anticipatory responses were found possibly due to sensory compensation processes of other intact afferents. Decreased compensatory responses may be interpreted as the additional balance threat, creating a more cautious behavior causing the CNS to generate a kind of over-compensatory behavior. Contrary to the expectations, there were different anticipatory and compensatory responses after reduced plantar inputs, thereby, revealing alterations in the organization of CNS inputs and outputs according to different task difficulties.\n- Andere Ausgabe\n- DOI:\n[10.1186/s12868-016-0279-2](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12868-016-0279-2)\n- Link zur Originalpublikation in der Zeitschrift \"BMC Neuroscience\"\nLink:\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12868-016-0279-2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12868-016-0279-2)\n- Freie Schlagw\u00f6rter (DE)\n- Spinal cord, Technische Universit\u00e4t Chemnitz, Publikationsfonds\n- Freie Schlagw\u00f6rter (EN)\n- Plantar hypothermia , CNS , spinal cord , dynamic balance , sensitivity , anticipatory responses , compensatory responses, Technische Universit\u00e4t Chemnitz, Publication fund\n- Klassifikation (DDC)\n- 610\n- Normschlagw\u00f6rter (GND)\n- R\u00fcckenmark, Balance, Hypothermie\n- Herausgeber (Institution)\n- Technische Universit\u00e4t Chemnitz\n- Verlag\n- BioMed Central Ltd.\n- URN Qucosa\n[urn:nbn:de:bsz:ch1-qucosa-209391](https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:ch1-qucosa-209391)\n- Ver\u00f6ffentlichungsdatum Qucosa\n- 30.08.2016\n- Dokumenttyp\n- Artikel\n- Sprache des Dokumentes\n- Englisch", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": [null, "/", "/", "/landing-page/#skip2content", "/landing-page/#skip2nav", "/impressum/", null, "https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:ch1-qucosa-209391", "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12868-016-0279-2", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12868-016-0279-2", "https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:ch1-qucosa-209391", "https://monarch.qucosa.de/api/qucosa%3A20548/attachment/ATT-0/", "https://monarch.qucosa.de/api/qucosa%3A20548/attachment/ATT-1/", "https://monarch.qucosa.de/api/qucosa%3A20548/attachment/ATT-2/", "/nutzungshinweise-fuer-die-digitalen-objekte-in-qucosa/#c328", "/landing-page/", "/landing-page/", null, null, "/", "/ueber-monarch/", "/recherche/", "/veroeffentlichen/", "/faq/", "/impressum/", "/datenschutzerklaerung/", "https://www.qucosa.de/typo3", "http://www.dini.de/"]}
