Due to these surveys and other research, you may have received traffic originating from our Minions. If you would prefer not to receive traffic from us in future, you have two options: blocking on our side or blocking on your side.\nBlocking on Our Side\n[\u00b6](#blocking-on-our-side)\nWe recommend this method because it is the most reliable. To have your IP addresses or network ranges added to our blocklist, please email us at\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#35464045455a474175575c5b54474c505152501b5c5a). Please include the following information:\n- Your name and the organization you represent, if any\n- The IP addresses or network ranges you'd like us to block on our side\n- The date, time, and addresses, if any, that contacted your hosts\nThis information will help us double-check that the scanning engine was the source of the traffic you received, ensure that there are no other sources of traffic coming from us, and get back to you if we have additional questions.\nBlocking on Your Side\n[\u00b6](#blocking-on-your-side)\nWe do not recommend this method because the hosts from which our scans originate are ephemeral and not associated with their IP addresses over the long-term. We publish an up-to-the-moment list of the addresses currently associated with our Minions\n[here](https://api.binaryedge.io/krang/v1/minions). Its format is as follows:\n{ \"scanners\": [ \"ipv4-address-1\", ... \"ipv4-address-N\", \"ipv6-address-1\", ... \"ipv6-address-M\" ] }\nThe list of Minion addresses for v1 of our scanning engine are available\n[here (IPv4)](https://api.binaryedge.io/v1/minions) and [here (IPv6)](https://api.binaryedge.io/v1/minions-ipv6). Please note that all of these endpoints are rate-limited, meaning if you request them too often you will receive\nHTTP 429 Too Many Requests responses.", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["#scanning-engine-v2-blocking", "../..", "../..", "../..", "../../api-v1/", "../../api-v2/", "../../search/", "../../image-search/", "../../torrents-search/", "../../sensors-search/", "../../errors/", "../../modules/", "../../torrent/", "../../sensors/", "../../sensors/", "../../sensors-search/", "../../sensors-tags/", "#introduction", "#blocking-on-our-side", "#blocking-on-your-side", "#scanning-engine-v2-blocking", "#introduction", "#blocking-on-our-side", "/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#35464045455a474175575c5b54474c505152501b5c5a", "#blocking-on-your-side", "https://api.binaryedge.io/krang/v1/minions", "https://api.binaryedge.io/v1/minions", "https://api.binaryedge.io/v1/minions-ipv6", "https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/"]}
