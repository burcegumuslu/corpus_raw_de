Introduction  \n1.1  Scope of work overview  \nKroll was engaged by the Embassy of Sweden in Maputo, Mozambique, to complete an \nindependent audit (the \u201cIndependent Audit \u201d) of debts in the region of USD 2 billion contracted by \nthree Mozambique Companies, namely ProIndicus S.A. (\u201cProIndicus \u201d), Empresa Mo\u00e7ambicana de \nAtum S.A. (\u201cEMATUM \u201d) and Mozambique Asset Management S.A. (\u201cMAM \u201d). The Independent Audit \nhas been conducted in the context of preliminary discovery proceedings underway by the Office of \nthe Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Mozambi que (the \u201cPGR \u201d).  \nThroughout this report, ProIndicus, EMATUM and MAM are, where relevant, collectively referred to \nas the \u201cMozambique Companies. \u201d An overview of the legal structure and purpose of each company \nis provided in the detailed sections of this re port.  \nThe main objective of the PGR -led work is to assess the existence of any criminal offenses or other \nirregularities related to the establishment and financing of procurement contracts and to the \noperations of the Mozambique Companies.  \nThe lead arrange rs of the loan agreements to the Mozambique Companies were as follows:  \n\uf0b7 Credit Suisse International (\u201cCredit Suisse \u201d) for the ProIndicus and EMATUM loans; and,  \n\uf0b7 VTB Capital PLC (\u201cVTB Capital \u201d) for the MAM loan.  \nThe primary suppliers to the Mozambique Compani es were as follows:  \n\uf0b7 Privinvest Shipbuilding S.A.L. Abu Dhabi Branch (\u201cPrivinvest Shipbuilding \u201d), for goods and \nservices to ProIndicus;  \n\uf0b7 Abu Dhabi Mar LLC (\u201cAbu Dhabi Mar \u201d), for goods and services to EMATUM; and,  \n\uf0b7 Privinvest Shipbuilding Investments LLC (\u201cPrivinvest Investments \u201d) for goods and services \nto MAM.  \n\uf0b7 Privinvest Shipbuilding, Abu Dhabi Mar and Privinvest Shipbuilding Investments are all part of \nthe wider Privinvest Group and are referred to hereafter as the \u201cContractor. \u201d \n\uf0b7 ProIndicus, EMATUM and MA M are collectively referred to hereafter as the \u201cMozambique \nCompanies \u201d; and, \n\uf0b7 References to the three projects together are referred to hereafter as the \u201cProIndicus Project \u201d, \nthe \u201cEMATUM Project \u201d, and the \u201cMAM Project \u201d or collectively as the \u201cMozambique Project. \u201d \n Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   5 | P a g e  \n 1.2  Interim report overview  \nOn 9 January 2017, Kroll produced an Interim Report which was subsequently reissued with \nupdated information on 30 January 2017 (the \u201cInterim Report \u201d). The Interim Report provided an \nupdate on the progress of the Indepen dent Audit and an overview of the preliminary findings and \nrecommendations at the time of the report.  \nKroll conducted extensive enquiries following the production of the Interim Report which further \ndeveloped the understanding of key issues. Where any diff erences appear between the Interim \nReport and this Final Report, the information contained in the Final Report should be considered \nKroll \u2019s final findings.  \n1.3  Post -publication clarifications  \nFollowing publication by the PGR of the Summary Report, dated 23 Ju ne 2017, Abu Dhabi Mar and \nPrivinvest, and Palomar Capital Advisors Ltd / Palomar Consultants LLC (together \u201cPalomar \u201d) have \nwritten to Kroll (via their respective lawyers) regarding the content of certain parts of the Summary \nReport. Kroll has made the fol lowing amendments to the content of the Summary Report:  \nSection 3.2.8: Expanding role of the Contractor (and related parties)  \nSection 3.2.8 of the Summary Report has been amended to clarify the distinct and separate roles \nof Abu Dhabi Mar and Privinvest (i .e., the \u201cContractor \u201d) and Palomar so that it reads as follows:  \nThe Contractor, as well as Palomar, a Privinvest Group company, has had an expanding role in the \nMozambique Project.  \nThe Contractor has had a role in: structuring the projects; introducing Cre dit Suisse as a lender; \nagreeing the Contractor Fees (to discount the interest rate payable by the Mozambique Companies \non the loans); providing funds to the Mozambique Companies to cover operational expenditure and \nshare capital; and funding loan repaymen ts.  \nPalomar had a role in: arranging the MAM loan agreement alongside VTB Capital; contracting with \nthe Mozambique Companies and the Ministry of Finance to restructure the ProIndicus and \nEMATUM loan agreement (and receiving fees for doing so); and (for Pr oIndicus) taking \nresponsibility for generating revenues and contracting to receive a proportion of any future \nrevenues.  \nSection 3.5.4: Asset verification  \nThe following sentence in the final paragraph in Section 3.5.4 has been removed: \u201cIt is noted that \nProIndicus, not the Contractor, appears to have received and paid invoices from [Redacted] for the \nservices delivered. \u201d Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   6 | P a g e  \n Section 3.7.4: Palomar and Legacy Advisors Limited  \nThe following sentence in the first paragraph in Section 3.7.4 has been removed: \u201cKroll requested \nfurther information from the Contractor for this transaction - at the time of reporting no further \ninformation had been provided to Kroll. \u201d \nReferences to the Mozambique Commercial Code  \nFor clarity, Kroll discusses in Section 9 of the full report how the limited invoice documentation \ngives rise to potential breaches of certain Articles in the Mozambique Commercial Code by the \nMozambique Companies (not by Abu Dhabi Mar and Privinvest and/or Palomar).  \nReferences to Palomar  \nThroughout the Independent Audit, Kroll has submitted extensive requests for documentation \nrelating to Palomar \u2019s role in the Mozambique Projects from ProIndicus, EMATUM and MAM and \nthe Ministry of Finance. The documentation provided to Kroll by ProIndicus, EMATUM and MAM \nand the Min istry of Finance has formed the basis of this Summary Report.  \nKroll also requested that ProIndicus request relevant documentation from Palomar, on the basis of \nthe contractual relationship between the parties. For clarity, Kroll did not interview Palomar or any \nemployees or directors of Palomar, and nor was Palomar asked to provide documents or other \ninformation by Kroll.  \nAppendix B (of the unpublished full report) references those parties that Kroll met during the \nIndependent Audit. For clarity, Appendix B confirms that Kroll did not meet with any representatives \nfrom Palomar.  \n \n  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   7 | P a g e  \n 2. Methodology  \n2.1  Independent Audit plan  \nKroll \u2019s original Independent Audit plan as detailed in the proposal dated 21 October 2016 outlined \nthat the first phase of the Independent Audi t was focused on the following areas:  \n\uf0b7 Obtaining comprehensive debriefs from key stakeholders;  \n\uf0b7 Requesting and obtaining relevant information from the Mozambique Companies and relevant \nMozambique authorities;  \n\uf0b7 Meeting certain individuals deemed appropriate by  the PGR; and,  \n\uf0b7 An initial review and analysis of documentation and other material relating to the Mozambique \nCompanies.  \nThroughout the Independent Audit, Kroll made detailed information requests to ProIndicus, \nEMATUM and MAM covering a broad range of finan cial data, supporting documentation and other \ninformation relating to the operations of the Mozambique Companies.  \nThe Mozambique Companies have provided limited financial data, including incomplete trial \nbalances and bank statements for certain periods, an d incomplete supporting documentation, such \nas loan facility agreements and supplier contracts.  \nAs a result, it became apparent that a significant amount of the information originally envisaged to \nbe held by the Mozambique Companies in Mozambique was not available. This required Kroll to \nissue a dditional information requests to several parties, as discussed in more detail in the next \nsection.  \n2.2  Requesting and obtaining relevant information  \nIn additional to the information requests to the Mozambique Companies, Kroll issued formal letters \nof request, with the assistance of the PGR, to the following parties:  \n\uf0b7 The Contractor;  \n\uf0b7 Credit Suisse and VTB Capital;  \n\uf0b7 The Bank of Mozambique (and certain local Mozambique Banks);  \n\uf0b7 The Mozambique Ministry of Finance; and , Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   8 | P a g e  \n \uf0b7 Other parties, including Ernst & Young (the external auditors to the Mozambique Companies), \nthe Ministry of Defence and the Servi\u00e7o de Informa\u00e7\u00f5es e Seguran\u00e7a do Estado  (\u201cSISE \u201d)1. \nKroll \u2019s pursuit of the information requested has necessitated multiple mee tings with the relevant \nparties in Mozambique, United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom over the course of the \nIndependent Audit. Kroll has worked closely with the PGR, legal advisors to the Contractor and \nlegal advisers to Credit Suisse to address the chal lenges in sharing confidential information in a \nproactive and practical manner.  \nA considerable volume of information, both in English and Portuguese, has been provided in \nresponse to Kroll \u2019s formal information requests, including: original loan agreements  and fee letters \nfrom the banks; final versions of supply contracts and appendices, and internal correspondence \nfiles from the Contractor; government guarantee documentation from the Ministry of Finance, and; \ninformation to support the audited financial st atements from Ernst & Young.  \n2.3  Company bank account analysis  \nThe Mozambique Companies were unable to provide complete bank account information to Kroll. \nConsequently, Kroll requested, via the Bank of Mozambique, details of local Mozambique bank \naccounts hel d by the Mozambique Companies. These requests included bank statements and, \nwhere relevant, supporting documents for certain transactions.  \nKroll \u2019s key findings in respect of specific transactions in the bank statements provided by the local \nMozambique ban ks is set out in the corresponding company sections of this report.  \nIn analysing the key sources of payments to and from the Mozambique Company bank accounts, \nKroll employed a minimum threshold of USD 2,500 (or the MZN equivalent). Transactions below \nUSD 2 ,500 were excluded from Kroll \u2019s analysis.  \nTransactions  were categorised based on the descriptions in the bank statements and other \ninformation available, such as company general ledgers. Transactions relating to transfers between \ncompany bank accounts were  not included in the analysis.  \nWhere  transactions could not be categorised based on the transaction description, the following \nmateriality thresholds were applied and designated into one of three categories:  \n\uf0b7 All transactions below USD 100,0002: not considered further for the Independent Audit;  \n \n1 Translation: State Information and Security Service  \n2 Note: USD value or MZN equivalent.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   9 | P a g e  \n \uf0b7 Round number transactions above USD 100,000 but below USD 250,0003: submitted for further \nreview; and,  \n\uf0b7 All transactions above USD 250,0004: submitted for further review.  \nKroll submitted information requests to local Mozambique banks for those transactions identified  \nfor additional review.  \nKroll also conducted enquiries with local Mozambique banks, through the Bank of Mozambique, to \nidentify all international transactions involving the Mozambique Companies, the Contractor, and \nother entities linked to the Contractor.  \nKroll  had not received responses from all local Mozambique banks at the time of reporting, and \nissues have been identified regarding the effectiveness of search criteria applied by certain local \nMozambique banks. Recommendations for further work in relation to company bank accounts have \nbeen made to the PGR. As a result, Kroll cannot rely on the completeness of this information for \nthe purposes of this report. A summary of the requests made to local Mozambique banks, through \nthe Bank of Mozambique, has been provided separately to the PGR.  \n2.4  Interaction with key stakeholders  \nThe key stakeholders for this Independent Audit were as follows:  \n\uf0b7 Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Mozambique (\u201cPGR\u201d). \n\uf0b7 Embassy of Sweden, Maputo, Mozambique (\u201cEmbassy of Sweden \u201d); and, \n\uf0b7 International Monetary Fund (\u201cIMF\u201d). \nThroughout  the Independent Audit, Kroll worked with the PGR to request and obtain information \nfrom the Mozambique Companies and other parties.  \n2.5  Meetings  \nAs part of the Independent Audit, Kroll held formal meetings with a wide -ranging group of individuals, \nincluding representatives from the Mozambique Companies, the Contractor, Credit Suisse and \nvarious Government Officials.  \nA full listing of inter viewees is provided at Appendix B.  \n \n3 Note: For example, a transaction of USD 110,000 (or MZN equivalent round number) was flagged for further review. Similarly, i f there \nwas a transaction of USD 276,397 (or MZN equivalent) the transaction was flagged for further review.  \n4 Note: USD value or MZN equivalent.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   10 | P a g e  \n 2.6  Currency conversion  \nCertain financial data and supporting documents reviewed by Kroll were prepared using the \nMozambique Metical.  \nThroughout the report, Kroll has converted Mozambique Metical (\u201cMZN \u201d) values to US Dollars  \n(\u201cUSD \u201d) or Euro (\u201cEUR \u201d) values where appropriate.  \nThe MZN transactions in Kroll \u2019s analysis were converted using the daily closing spot price obtained \nfrom Bloomberg. Where any discrepancies exist between amounts identified in Kroll \u2019s analysis and \nthose c ontained in banking and SWIFT records for international payments, the difference is due to \nthe exchange rate offered by the individual banks on that day, which may differ from the closing \nspot price quoted by Bloomberg.  \n2.7  Language  \nThis report and the supporting appendices was translated fully from English into Portuguese using \na certified legal translator. Where relevant, references to supporting documentation and/or \ninformation sources are provided as footnotes, citing the English language file name. In the event \nof any inconsistency  or discrepancy between the English  language  version of this report and the \nPortuguese language version, the English language version shall prevail .  \nWhere relevant, Kroll has abbreviated key terms throughout the report - a summary is provided at \nAppendix A (Glossary of common names and terms).  \n \n  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   11 | P a g e  \n 3. Executive Summary  \n3.1  Introduction  \n3.1.1  Background to the three maritime projects  \nKroll was provided with a document entitled the \u201cMozambique Maritime Projects Presentation \u201d \n(hereafter the  \u201cPrivinvest Presentation \u201d) by the Contractor. The Privinvest Presentation refers to \n\u201cthree maritime projects \u201d and states that whilst each project had its own purpose and scope, the \nthree were best understood together as elements of a single project which developed over the \ncourse of 2013 and 2014 \u201c\u2026to furnish Mozambique with the means to assert sovereignty over its \nExclusive Economic Zone and exploit the natural resources within it. \u201d \nThe Privinvest Presentation set out the following objectives for the Moza mbique Companies:  \nProIndicus:  To acquire an Exclusive Economic Zone monitoring and protection solution from the \nPrivinvest Group. ProIndicus signed a supply contract with Privinvest Shipbuilding on 18 January \n2013.  \nEMATUM:  To acquire the capability to develop a home -grown and self -sustaining fishing industry \nin Mozambique, including the supply of a modern fleet of vessels, equipment, associate training \nservices, intellectual property licence and technology transfer. EMATUM signed a supply contract \nwith Abu Dhabi Mar on 2 August 2013.  \nMAM:  To acquire the infrastructure and facilities needed to enable Mozambique to offer fixed and \nmobile maintenance and repair services to: 1) vessels supplied to ProIndicus and EMATUM, and; \n2) other vessels used in connection with the offshore oil and gas industry in Mozambique. The MAM \nProject \u201c\u2026also included the licencing of intellectual property rights supported by a transfer of \ntechnology to MAM to enable it to assemble and sell the Governme nt vessels to third parties in \nMozambique and worldwide .\u201d MAM signed a supply contract with Privinvest Investments on 1 May \n2014.  \nThe President of the Administration Board of ProIndicus, EMATUM and MAM is Ant\u00f3nio Carlos do \nRos\u00e1rio (\u201cRos\u00e1rio \u201d), a senior mem ber of the State Information and Security Service (\u201cSISE \u201d). \nProIndicus, EMATUM and MAM have all been incorporated as private Sociedade An\u00f3nima (\u201cS.A.\u201d) \ncompanies. However, as the shareholders for each company are either directly or indirectly owned \nby the Mozambique State, the companies may be considered to be state owned companies rather Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   12 | P a g e  \n than as private companies.5  The Privinvest Group, in the Privinvest Presentation, refers to \nProIndicus, EMATUM and MAM as being state owned companies.  \n3.1.2  Limitations of scope  \nThe Independent Audit relied upon Kroll being provided with complete documentation by the \nrepresentatives of the Mozambique Companies, by the government officials who approved the \nguarantees for the lending, by the banks that provided the loan agreements,  and most recently by \nthe Contractor that provided the assets and services, who were all asked to provide such \ndocumentation to Kroll on a voluntary basis. Due to the intended purpose of the Independent Audit, \nKroll was not able to agree to keep the inform ation contained in such documentation confidential.  \nIt should also be noted that, in reaching the conclusions set out in this report, Kroll has not had \naccess to full and complete documentation, including internal confidential documents of the parties \ninvolved, nor has it met with all key personnel of the parties involved. The main challenge in \ncompleting the Independent Audit was the lack of documentation available from the Mozambique \nCompanies. Kroll spent a considerable amount of time requesting and liai sing with representatives \nof the Mozambique Companies to obtain documentation and information that was, in some cases, \neither ultimately incomplete or not provided at all. Kroll \u2019s findings should be considered in this \ncontext.  \nThe Mozambique Project is pri marily managed by individuals who are either employed by or \nconnected to SISE. Person A and other senior figures were responsible for signing the supply \ncontracts on behalf of the Mozambique Companies. The contractual structure makes it difficult to \nunders tand the value attributed to specific assets. Kroll repeatedly requested from Person A the \noutstanding information that would provide a fuller understanding of expenditure: the response \nreceived was that the requested information was \u201cclassified \u201d and not a vailable.  \nIt was therefore necessary to request and obtain documentation from Credit Suisse and VTB \nCapital regarding the loan agreements, the Contractor regarding the supply contracts, as well as \nother various government departments and third parties for other relevant documentation.  \n  \n \n5 Note: Kroll was informed by the PGR that ProIndicus, EMATUM and MAM are classified as \u201cCompanies of the State Entrepreneurial  \nSector\u201d.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   13 | P a g e  \n 3.2  Summary of key findings  \nThe Independent Audit enabled Kroll to confirm the roles of the various parties involved in \nformulating and implementing the Mozambique Project structure, and the resulting questions and \nevidential g aps that this has created in understanding the expenditure of the USD 2 billion loan \nproceeds. Kroll \u2019s work has provided clarity on:  \n\uf0b7 The structure of the loan agreements between Credit Suisse and VTB Capital and the \nMozambique Companies, specifically the c ategories and amounts of fees paid to the banks, \nand the actual loan proceeds disbursed to the Contractor;  \n\uf0b7 The intended and actual scope of each supply contract, including the current status of delivery \nof the assets and services to be provided, the signif icant difficulties in understanding the \nunderlying pricing structure of the supply contracts, the discrepancies in the prices of delivered \nassets and services, and the challenges encountered by the Contractor in delivering the \nexpected assets and services;  \n\uf0b7 The operational and financial standing of the Mozambique Companies, specifically that the \ncompanies appear to be inadequately managed, are not fully operational, have generated no \nmeaningful revenues, have no contracts in place to provide future revenues,  and that \noperational expenditure was paid for by the Contractor;  \n\uf0b7 The significant and expanding role that the Contractor and certain associated companies have \nin the Mozambique Project, particularly in providing funds to the Mozambique Companies to \ncover o perational expenditure, in restructuring the loans, and in taking responsibility for \ngenerating future revenues; and,  \n\uf0b7 The limitations in the process for issuing government guarantees.  \nNotable findings in relation to the above points are summarised in more detail below, and in greater \ndetail in separate company specific sections. Kroll has separately provided recommendations for \nfurther work to the PGR for each key finding.  \n3.2.1  Confirmation that fees paid to banks totalled USD 199.7 million  \nKroll clarified the s tructure of the respective loan agreements for the Mozambique Companies. In \nsummary, the Mozambique Companies negotiated loan agreements totalling USD 2 billion with \nCredit Suisse and VTB Capital.  \nTable 1 provides a summary of the loans agreements entered  into by the Mozambique Companies \nand the related fees paid to Credit Suisse and VTB Capital:  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   14 | P a g e  \n Table 1 | Summary of the loans agreements entered into by the Mozambique Companies  \nDescription   ProIndicus   EMATUM   MAM   Total  \n Lead Loan Arranger   Credit Suisse   Credit Suisse   VTB Capital    \n Interest Rate   LIBOR + 3.20%   LIBOR + 3.70%   LIBOR + 7.00%  \n Final Loan Amount  622,000,000  850,000,000  535,000,000  2,007,000,000  \n Bank Fees  (10,113,200)  (13,700,000)  (35,000,000)  (58,813,200)  \n Contractor Fee  (64,423,600)  (76,500,000)6 - (140,923,600)  \n Total Paid to Contractor  547,463,200  759,800,000  500,000,000  1,807,263,200  \n \nOf the total USD 2 billion loan proceeds, USD 199.7 million was deducted by Credit Suisse and \nVTB Capital for Arrangement Fees (USD 58.8 million) and Contractor Fees (USD 140.9 million). \nThe Contractor explained that the Contractor Fees (or \u201cSubvention Fee s\u201d) were introduced to allow \nthe lending banks to achieve a return at an interest rate more accurately reflecting Mozambique \u2019s \nrisk profile. Credit Suisse explained that the Contractor Fees were effectively passed on to \nsyndicate loan members or, in the ca se of EMATUM, to note investors that purchased the debt.  \nAn example of the explanation provided by Credit Suisse is identifiable in transaction documents \nprovided by Moza Banco relating to a USD 20 million tranche of the ProIndicus loan (purchased by \nMoza  Banco). The trade confirmation documentation shows that although Moza Banco purchased \nUSD 20 million of the loan, the bank was only required to pay Credit Suisse USD 18.2 million as \nthey received USD 1.8 million of the Contractor Fees. This equates to a 9 % discount to Moza Banco. \nAs a result, Moza Banco would have increased the yield received on the investment.  \nThe deduction of the Arrangement Fees and Contractor Fees resulted in actual loan proceeds of \nUSD 1.8 billion being directly transferred in several  tranches to Contractor bank accounts in the \nUnited Arab Emirates.7 No loan proceeds were directly transferred to the Mozambique Companies \nby Credit Suisse or VTB Capital. However, the Contractor has made transfers totalling USD 18.2 \nmillion to the Mozambi que Companies for operational expenses.  \nIn addition, Kroll identified that \u201cRunning Fees \u201d totalling a further USD 57.3 million were agreed as \na result of restructuring the terms of the ProIndicus loan agreement in December 2014.

The document details payments totalling USD 31.4 million \nto twelve parties, including:  \n\uf0b7 USD 17.3 million to a Banco Nacional de Investimento Mozambique (\u201cBNI Mozambique \u201d) and \nErnst & Young consortium;  \n\uf0b7 USD 4.1 million to Credit Suisse  \n\uf0b7 USD 3.8 million to Palomar  \n\uf0b7 USD 2.1 million to VTB Capital  \n\uf0b7 USD 4.1 million to several other parties  \nThe Ministry of Finance informed Kroll that the BNI Mozambique  and Ernst & Young Consortium \nstated it had the support of several entities throughout the restructuring process, and requested \npayments to these entities.  \nFurther details for each payment are provided at Section 3.4.2.  \n3.2.3  Inconsistencies in stated purpose of USD 500 million l oan proceeds  \nThe Independent Audit has established that there are inconsistencies between explanations \nprovided by Person A , the Ministry of Defence and the Contractor regarding the actual use of USD \n500 million of the loan proceeds.  \nInitially, Kroll was i nformed by the Ministry of Finance that USD 500 million of the EMATUM loan \nwas integrated into the national budget in 2014.  \nA document published by the IMF, entitled \u201cStaff Report for the 2015 Article IV Consultation, fifth \nreview under the Policy Support  Instrument \u201d states that the Government of Mozambique \nguaranteed a USD 850 million bond issued in 2013 by EMATUM to finance the purchase of tuna \nfishing boats and maritime security equipment. The document states that subsequently USD 500 \nmillion was incorp orated into the State budget for the maritime security equipment, and became \npublic debt under the responsibility of the Treasury.  \n \n8 Note: Throughout this report, \u201cPalomar\u201d refers to Palomar Capital Advisors Ltd and Palomar Consultants LLC.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   16 | P a g e  \n The Ministry of Finance has not been able to confirm to Kroll any details of the maritime security \nequipment that was effect ively included in the USD 500 million allocation, nor if the transfer of \nresponsibility has actually been completed.  \nSeparately, Person A stated to Kroll that USD 500 million of the loan proceeds were used to \npurchase military equipment and provided an uns igned letter purportedly from the Role  I to support \nthis statement. Role  I refused to sign this letter and denied having any knowledge of the military \nequipment purchased.  \nThe Contractor has categorically stated to Kroll that the assets delivered to EMATUM were per the \nagreed supply contract and specifically that no weapons were provided.  \nIn order to verify how the USD 500 million loan proceeds were actually allocated, a framework that \npreserves the confidentiality of restricted information contain ed in the relevant documents needs \nto be agreed, or for those involved to waive the confidentiality of such information. This will enable \nKroll to be provided with further documentation from the Contractor explaining the pricing structure \nof the EMATUM con tract, without breaching the terms of the supply contract.  \nUntil the inconsistencies are resolved, and satisfactory documentation is provided, at least USD \n500 million of expenditure of a potentially sensitive nature remains unaudited and unexplained.  \n3.2.4  Discrepancies in the prices of delivered assets and services  \nThe Independent Audit has enabled Kroll to obtain an understanding of the key assets and services \nto be provided by the Contractor to the Mozambique Companies, including the overall value of each \ncontract. However, gaps remain in understanding how exactly the USD 2 billion was spent, despite \nconsiderable efforts to close this gap.  \nKroll was not able to undertake any form of reliable valuation of the assets and services to be \nprovided by the Contract or under the three supply contracts with the Mozambique Companies. \nInstead Kroll, with the support of an independent expert, has sought to estimate the price \ndiscrepancy of the assets and services provided under each supply contract.  \nKroll has compared the  prices in invoices provided by the Contractor for the DV15 Interceptor \nvessels, HSI32 Interceptor vessels, WP18 Interceptor vessels and Maritime Patrol Aircraft for \nProIndicus, and the  Ocean Eagle vessels and Longliner vessels for EMATUM. This exercise ha s \nbeen undertaken to give a sense of the discrepancies and differences which Kroll was unable to \nexplain due to the lack of documentation provided to Kroll.  \nThe differences between prices of the aforementioned assets and services outlined in the invoices \nprovided to ProIndicus and EMATUM by the Contractor, compared to the prices estimated by the \nindependent expert total approximately USD 713 million. This difference may be explained in \nadditional documentation from the Contractor that has not been provided  to Kroll. However, at the Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   17 | P a g e  \n conclusion of Kroll \u2019s Independent Audit the differences remain unexplained and warrant further \nconsideration . \n3.2.5  Undisclosed bank account and unexplained USD 53 million payment  \nKroll \u2019s enquiries identified that EMATUM held a bank account at Moza Banco which was not \nrecorded in the accounting records of EMATUM. The Moza Banco account was used to make two \ninterest payments to Credit Suisse totalling more than USD 51 million in March 2014 and \nSeptember 2014. The two interest payments we re funded by transfers into the Moza Banco bank \naccount from a SISE bank account. The source of the SISE funds was a Bank of Mozambique bank \naccount, opened at the request of the Ministry of Finance.  \nThe process for making the two interest payments contrad icts the 2014 audited financial statements \nfor EMATUM  (\u201cEMATUM Financial Statements for 2014\u201d) , which stated that the Contractor, not \nSISE, provided EMATUM with an advance for USD 53 million for the interest payments to Credit \nSuisse. This was supported by  a letter from the Contractor to EMATUM which stated that payments \nof USD 53 million were made directly to EMATUM \u2019s lenders, a claim also stated in an audit \nrepresentation letter signed by Person A . It is possible that details regarding these transactions in \nthe audit representation letter, and thus the EMATUM Financial Statements for 2014 , are incorrect.  \n3.2.6  Confirmation that the Mozambique Companies are not fully operational  \nKroll \u2019s analysis of the business plans and feasibility studies for the Mozambique Com panies \nindicates that they were expected to generate combined operating revenues of USD 2.3 billion by \nDecember 2016. At the time of reporting, negligible revenue has been generated and the \nMozambique Companies can only meet debt obligations and operationa l expenses with the \nfinancial support of either shareholders, the Ministry of Finance or the Contractor.  \nThe shareholders have made transfers to the Mozambique Companies totalling USD 70 million for \ninterest payments and operational expenses. The source of  the shareholders \u2019 funds has not yet \nbeen fully established as a court order is required to access shareholder bank accounts. The \nContractor has made payments totalling USD 18.2 million to the Mozambique Companies for \noperational expenses. A number of thes e payments are not supported by agreements between the \nContractor and the Mozambique Companies.  \nIt is not known when, or indeed, if, the Mozambique Project will become fully operational, but it \nappears that this would require considerable financial investm ent. Even assuming that the \nMozambique Project could be operationalised, it is not known when profits might be realised.  \n3.2.7  Evidence of management failings  \nThe Independent Audit identified what appear to be considerable management failings in meeting \ncontract ual obligations and in establishing the local infrastructure required to enable the Contractor Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   18 | P a g e  \n to deliver the intended assets and services, as well as a failure to undertake the required actions \nnecessary to ensure the Mozambique Projects could operate as planned.  \nThe Mozambique Companies lack some of the basic infrastructure to enable operations to \ncommence: ProIndicus does not have an operational satellite package; EMATUM does not currently \nhave permits for the fishing vessels; and MAM has only recently o btained access to a shipyard in \nMaputo that is undergoing an upgrade to enable the maintenance of vessels.  \nThe Contractor has provided Kroll with several hundred documents including emails and meeting \nminutes to demonstrate the challenges encountered in d elivering the Mozambique Project. The \ndocuments show repeated efforts by the Contractor to obtain responses from Person A for project \nmanagement issues. The documents also provide an insight to the issues faced by the Contractor \nin delivering the contracted assets and services for the Mozambique Companies.  \nFor example, according to the documentation, for ProIndicus the train ees provided by the company \ndid not have the necessary pre -course skills and qualifications or appropriate technical knowledge \nto be able to undertake the HSI32 courses; trainees did not have the appropriate clothing for \ntraining; representatives for ProIn dicus were not present at the handover for the DV15 vessels and \nemployees trained to operate the Control and Command System were subsequently called for \nmilitary training. For EMATUM, the company has not secured the required land and buildings to \nequip a c oordination centre.  \nThe failure of management to secure an appropriate shipyard base at Maputo in a timely manner \n(approximately eighteen month s later than planned) means that the MAM Project remains a work \nin progress. It is not possible to establish the stage of completion of the project, nor the funds \nremaining to be spent from the total contract price of USD 500 million.  \nThe apparent mismanagement by Person A and other senior members of the Mozambique \nCompanies appear to have contributed to significant delays in the delivery of the Mozambique \nProject. Kroll cannot ascertain the impact of these delays on the overall pricing of the project without \nfurther information from the Contractor.  \n3.2.8  Expanding role of the Contractor (and related parties)  \nThe Contractor , as well as Palomar, a Privinvest Group company, has had an expanding role in the \nMozambique Project.  \nThe Contractor has had a role in: structuring the projects; introducing Credit Suisse as a lender; \nagreeing the Contractor Fees (to discount the interest  rate payable by the Mozambique Companies \non the loans); providing funds to the Mozambique Companies to cover operational expenditure and \nshare capital; and funding loan repayments.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   19 | P a g e  \n Palomar had a role in: arranging the MAM loan agreement alongside VTB Cap ital; contracting with \nthe Mozambique Companies and the Ministry of Finance to restructure the ProIndicus and \nEMATUM loan agreement (and receiving fees for doing so); and (for ProIndicus) taking \nresponsibility for generating revenues and contracting to rec eive a proportion of any future \nrevenues.  \nIn December 2014, the ProIndicus loan agreement was restructured to increase the authorised \nloan amount from USD 622 million to USD 900 million (an increase of USD 278 million). The \nrestructuring of the loan introd uced a new repayment plan, however, the rationale for increasing \nthe loan amount is unconfirmed (a request for a government guarantee for the increase indicated \nthat the additional funds would enable debt repayment on the initial loan agreement). The addit ional \nloan proceeds of USD 278 million have not been drawn down, and Credit Suisse has confirmed to \nKroll that the facility has now expired. The restructure involved an agreement to pay Palomar \n\u201cRunning Fees \u201d totalling at least USD 30.6 million over the co urse of the loan agreement.  \nThe first instalment of the Running Fees, which was paid by the Ministry of Finance on 21 March \n2016, included a USD 7.8 million payment to Palomar (in addition to separate payments to Credit \nSuisse and VTB Capital).  \nThe docum ents reviewed by Kroll confirm that Person B , Role B , was involved in the restructuring \nof the ProIndicus loan agreement (in  his/her role at Palomar). Person B was previously employed \nat [Redacted] and was involved in the initial loan agreements between Pr oIndicus and Credit Suisse.  \n3.2.9  Inadequate process for issuing government guarantees  \nThe Independent Audit confirmed that the process for providing government guarantees appears \nto be inadequate. Specifically, no documentation was provided to evidence that any  assessment \ntook place before Role C signed three of the five government guarantees with a combined value of \nUSD 1 billion.  \nThe Role C , Person C , voluntarily admitted to Kroll that  he/she knowingly breached agreed budget \nlaws by approving the government guarantees for the Mozambique Companies and explained that \nSISE officials convinced  him/her to approve the government guarantees on the basis of national \nsecurity.  \nAdditionally, potential conflict of interest issues were identified regarding the process for granting \nthe government guarantees for the Mozambique Companies. Specifically, Person D , the Role D  \nresponsible for signing the ProIndicus and MAM government guar antee opinion documents, was \nappointed to the EMATUM Administration Board on 2 August 2013, approximately one month prior \nto the EMATUM government guarantee being issued. Person D  was paid USD 95,000 for  his/her \nrole as a [Redacted]  during the period of Au gust 2013 to July 2014 by EMATUM.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   20 | P a g e  \n 3.3  Prolndicus: Key observations  \n3.3.1  Tendering for the Mozambique Project  \nThe Privinvest Presentation stated that the Government of Mozambique began discussions with \u201ca \nrange of potential suppliers \u201d in 2011, and that after two ye ars the Contractor was selected to supply \nProIndicus (and subsequently EMATUM and MAM). Person A has previously informed Kroll that  \nhe/she conducted web -based research to identify potential suppliers and that several parties other \nthan the Contractor were considered for the Mozambique Project.  \nKroll has also sought to understand what, if any, due diligence was carried out by the Mozambique \nCompanies and the Government of Mozambique in relation to the selection of the Contractor to \ndevelop the Mozambique Pro jects.  \nDespite repeated requests, Person A has refused to provide any information relating to other \nsuppliers that were considered or what due diligence was undertaken on the Contractor. Person A \nhas stated that this information is maintained by SISE and c annot be provided citing \u201cnational \nsecurity \u201d reasons. Kroll \u2019s requests to obtain access to this information directly from SISE have been \nrefused by the Role E , Person E . Further, the Role F , Person F , has informed Kroll that no records \nrelating to the Moza mbique Companies were provided to  him/her since taking office.  \n3.3.2  Loan agreement  \nTable 2 provides a summary of the ProIndicus loan agreement, including the total loan facility drawn \ndown and the fees deducted by Credit Suisse and VTB Capital.  \nTable 2 | Summary of ProIndicus loan  \nDetails  Amount (USD)  Balance (USD)  \nTotal loan facility drawn down (Credit Suisse)  504,000,000   \nTotal loan facility drawn down (VTB Capital)  118,000,000   \nTotal loan facility drawn down   622,000,000  \nArrangement Fees paid by ProIndicus to Credit Suisse  (8,225,200)   \nArrangement Fees paid by ProIndicus to VTB Capital  (1,888,000)   \nTotal \u201cArrangement Fees\u201d   (10,113,200)  \nSub-Total (\u201cContractor Portion\u201d)   611,886,800  \nContractor Fee paid by the Contractor  to Credit Suisse  (48,824,000)   \nContractor Fee paid by the Contractor to VTB Capital  (15,599,600)   Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   21 | P a g e  \n Total \u201cContractor Fees\u201d   (64,423,600)  \nTotal payments to Contractor account    547,463,200  \n \nOn 28 February 2013, ProIndicus and Credit Suisse signed a loan agreement for USD 372 million, \nwhich was subsequently amended on two occasions on 14 June 2013 and 17 December 2014, to \nallow a maximum loan facility limit of USD 900 million.  \nThe original an d amended loan agreements were guaranteed by the Government of Mozambique, \nacting through the Ministry of Finance and represented by Person C . Between 21 March 2013 and \n15 November 2013, ProIndicus utilised USD 622 million of the loan facility.  \nThe Contractor, according to the Privinvest Presentation, introduced Prolndicus to Credit Suisse, \nfollowing a written request from Person C . The Contractor stated that Credit Suisse negotiated the \nterms of the financing independently with the Government of  Mozambique, and that negotiations \ninvolving the Contractor were limited to discussions around an \u201cappropriate subvention fee charged \nto the contractor \u201d (further details provided below). It is not known who represented the Government \nof Mozambique for nego tiating the loan agreements.  \nProIndicus authorised Credit Suisse and VTB Capital to deduct fees for arranging the loans totalling \nUSD 10.1 million. The utilisation requests also authorised both banks to withhold \u201cContractor Fees \u201d \ntotalling USD 64.4 million . As a result, the total loan proceeds remaining after the Arrangement \nFees and Contractor Fees was USD 547.5 million - this amount was paid to the Contractor \u2019s bank \naccount in the United Arab Emirates.  \nThe Contractor explained to Kroll that the Contractor  Fees (also termed \u201cSubvention Fees \u201d) were \nintroduced by Credit Suisse and the Government of Mozambique because the pricing terms of the \nloan which the Government of Mozambique was prepared to agree for the purposes of a \ngovernment guarantee were not comme rcially acceptable to Credit Suisse and prevented them \nfrom syndicating the loan. Credit Suisse explained that the Contractor Fee was \u201ceffectively passed \non in an approximately pro rata basis to the amount of loan sold on to syndicate members .\u201d  \nThe Contractor further stated to Kroll that the effect of the fee was to ensure that \u201cCredit Suisse \nachieved a return that was equivalent to the return it would have achieved had it advanced funds \nat a market rate more accurately reflecting Mozambique \u2019s risk profile; and the loan could be \nsyndicated. \u201d \nThe Contractor Fees of USD 64.4 million withheld by Credit Suisse on behalf of the Contractor \nequate to 10.3% of the total loan value of USD 622 million.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   22 | P a g e  \n In addition, \u201cRunning Fees \u201d totalling USD 57.3 million  were agreed as part of the amended loan \nagreement dated 17 December 2014, payable to Credit Suisse, VTB Capital and Palomar over the \ncourse of the loan. Palomar is purportedly owned by the Contractor and Person B , a Role B . \nKroll has not seen documentatio n to explain the rationale for the agreement to pay Palomar an \nannual fee of 1.25% of the total loan outstanding, a rate which is greater than that paid to both \nCredit Suisse (0.95%) and VTB Capital (0.75%).9 The role of Palomar as it relates to ProIndicus , \nEMATUM and MAM is discussed at Section 3.7.  \nAs of 14 March 2017, principal repayments on the loan totalled USD 24.9 million, interest payments \ntotalled USD 71.5 million (together totalling USD 96.4 million), and the balance of the loan \noutstanding was US D 597.1 million. The first two interest payments made by ProIndicus were \nfunded by the company \u2019s shareholders, Monte Binga and GIPS. The first payment was funded by \ntwo separate loans obtained by Monte Binga and GIPS from Millennium Banco Internacional \nde Mo\u00e7ambique S.A. (\u201cBIM Mozambique \u201d) and guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance. The second \npayment was solely funded by GIPS through transfers from SISE to a GIPS BNI Mozambique  bank \naccount.  \nKroll was informed by the Ministry of Finance that ProIndicus defa ulted on the principal and interest \npayments due on 21 March 2017.  \n3.3.3  Revenue projections  \nThe ProIndicus Business Plan stated that the company was expected to generate estimated \noperating revenues of USD 607.8 million by December 2016, which after operating c osts of USD \n29.5 million, would leave \u201ccashflow available for debt service \u201d of USD 556.2 million.  \nAt the time of reporting , ProIndicus has not generated any operating revenues based on information \nprovided to Kroll.  \nThe basis for the revenue projections wa s split into several categories: protection of infrastructure \nat sea; protection of vessels on transit; protection of fishing boats; port concession fees; protection \nof tourist boats; search and rescue and, finally; \u201cperiodical import of arms. \u201d Kroll has n ot received \nany documentation to substantiate these estimates or what the \u201cperiodical import of arms \u201d \nconstitutes.  \nThe primary source of revenue was anticipated to be \u201cincome from protection of infrastructure at \nsea\u201d, equal to at least 50% of the expected revenue each year, derived from anticipated contracts \nwith foreign gas companies through charging fees for security and protection. Kroll was informed \nby Person A that no contracts were agreed with foreign gas companies, even in principle, for the \n \n9 Note: Following publication of the Summary Report, Palomar provided Kroll with a letter dated 4 December 2014 that sets out t heir role \nas financial advi sors to ProIndicus for the purposes of refinancing the facility agreement.

As a result, the original contract price of USD 366 million \nwas incr eased to USD 616 million.  \nProIndicus provided Kroll with a one page undated invoice (hereafter the \u201cProIndicus Invoice \u201d) \nunder a supply contract dated 18 January 2013 (hereafter the \u201cProIndicus Supply Contract \u201d), which \nlisted the assets and services and th eir corresponding prices .

The invoices provided to Kroll do not provide \nsufficient detail to gain comfort that the docume nts accurately reflect the true price of these assets \nand services, and therefore do not allow accurate accounting records to be maintained by the \ncompany.

Additionally, the specification of the Maritime \nPatrol Aircraft differs sign ificantly from the original contract. The contract price increased from USD \n372 million to USD 622 million (an additional USD 250 million).  \nKroll \u2019s interpretation of the contractual documents provided by ProIndicus is that weapons were, in \nthe ProIndicus Supply Contract, envisaged to be provided and fitted for certain vessels under the \noriginal contract for USD 372 million, yet were subsequently removed from the scope of supply \nthrough the various changes orders, despite the increase in loan value by USD 2 50 million to USD \n622 million.  \nThe original ProIndicus Supply Contract provided by ProIndicus to Kroll, between the Contractor \nand ProIndicus,11 stated that the Vigilante 400 CL vessels (which were subsequently removed from \n \n11 Note: Original supply contract provided by ProIndicus, not the Contractor.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   25 | P a g e  \n the contract) would be fitted wit h a [Redacted] and [Redacted] , and that DV15 Interceptor vessels \nwould be fitted with a [Redacted]  designed to accommodate [Redacted] . \nThe final amendment to the supply contract did not include the provision of weapons for any vessel. \nNone of the vessels physically verified by Kroll were fitted with weapons. ProIndicus has not \nprovided any explanation as to why the weapons element of the specifications was removed in the \nfinal version of the contract. The Contractor has categorically stated to Kroll that n o weapons were \nprovided as part of the contract.  \nGiven the stated nature of the project, i.e. the monitoring and protecting of Mozambique \u2019s Exclusive \nEconomic Zone, it is remarkable  that the vessels were not fitted with weapons, as this will \nundoubtedly re strict the ability of the vessels and their operators to effectively police the Exclusive \nEconomic Zone.  \nIt is not possible to accurately establish the extent of any difference in list price for the Vigilante \n400 CL vessels (two removed from contract) comp ared to the HSI32 Interceptor vessel or WP18 \nInterceptor vessel (three each added to contract). However, it should be noted that both the HSI32 \nInterceptor vessel and WP18 Interceptor vessel are significantly smaller vessels and designed for \na wholly diffe rent purpose compared to the Vigilante 400 CL vessel. Minutes of a meeting dated 25 \nApril 2013 between the Contractor and ProIndicus stated that the scope of supply was amended to \nreplace large assets with \u201c\u2026smaller but faster vessels, which can provide a better \u2026 coverage of \nthe EEZ [Exclusive Economic Zone] .\u201d \nKroll \u2019s analysis in respect of the prices included in invoices provided by the Contractor for assets \nand services under the ProIndicus Supply Contract is provided at Section 3.6.  \n3.3.5  Asset verification  \nKroll visited several sites in Mozambique to verify the existence of the assets delivered by the \nContractor to ProIndicus per the terms of the final supply contract. Kroll has established that the \nmajority of the assets listed in the ProIndicus contract exi st and are physically located in \nMozambique.  \nThe assets procured are either moored in Pemba harbour, or in dry storage in Pemba Naval Base \nor Maputo Sea Port. It appears that the assets are not yet operational for a variety of reasons \nincluding i) a lack of trained crew for vessels, and ii) the absence of a satellite contract to enable \nthe communication systems to function (refer to Section 3.3.7).  \n3.3.6  Payments to fund share capital and support operations  \nOn 18 January 2013 the Contractor sent a letter to Pro Indicus which stated that \u201c\u2026within the spirit \nof cooperation and partnershi p\u201d between the two companies, the Contractor was irrevocably \ncommitted to providing USD 13 million to ProIndicus.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   26 | P a g e  \n The letter, signed by Person G  on behalf of the Contractor, was se nt on the same date as the \nsigning of the original ProIndicus Supply Contract . The letter did not specify the purpose for the \nfunds transfer, but stated that \u201cPrivinvest Shipbuilding SAL is confident that its partnership with \nProIndicus SA will lead to mor e ventures which will in the future make up for this contribution. \u201d \nKroll \u2019s analysis of bank records confirms that on 25 March 2013, four days after the first loan \npayment to the Contractor, a Banco Comercial e de Investimentos Mozambique (\u201cBCI \nMozambique \u201d) bank account held by ProIndicus received an amount of USD 12,999,958 from a \nbank account in the United Arab Emirates held by the Contractor.  \nThe notes to the ProIndicus audited financial statements for 2013 (ProIndicus Financial Statements \nfor 2013 ) state \u201c\u2026on 23 October 2013,12  ProIndicus received USD 13 million \u201d and that USD \n500,000 would be allocated to paid -up share capital with the remaining USD 12.5 million \u201c\u2026utilized \nto support the start of the operations related to the protection and security serv ices. \u201d13 \nIt is possible that the payment was made without the knowledge of Credit Suisse. Clause 3.1 of the \noriginal loan agreement stated that \u201c\u2026the Borrower shall apply all amounts borrowed by it under \nthe Facility towards the financing of the Project. \u201d  \nFurther, the Contractor stated that Credit Suisse insisted \u201c\u2026no funds raised pursuant to the \nProIndicus financing were paid into banks or accounts in Mozambique .\u201d \nKroll \u2019s review of bank records has confirmed that no funds were contributed as share capital by the \nProIndicus shareholders, Monte Binga and GIPS, prior to the USD 13 million payment. The \napplication of USD 500,000 of the USD 13 million payment to fund share capital therefore appears \nto be designed to allow Monte Binga and GIPS, both state owned e nterprises, to contribute capital \nto ProIndicus.  \n3.3.7  Issues encountered by Contractor in delivering the supply contract  \nThe Privinvest Presentation stated that the Contractor had encountered \u201c\u2026numerous challenges \nin delivering the Exclusive Economic Zone Project. \u201d  \nA summary of the challenges that the Contractor stated it encountered are set out verbatim below:  \n1. \u201cInsufficient assistance from the project companies:  The delivery of the project depended \non the project companies performing their contractual obl igation to assist and cooperate with \nthe Contractors - for example, by providing in -country transportation, arranging for the provision \nof a local workforce, and procuring access to sites. The project companies frequently did not \nprovide the required assis tance, and this delayed and impended delivery.  \n \n12 Note: The reason for the payment being described as received on 23 October 2013 is possibly due to the bank payment confirmat ion \nhaving that date at the top of the document, however this cannot be confirmed.  \n13 Document Reference: 2013 -12-31 ProIndicus 201 3 Financial Statements (PT) (Note 14, page 26).  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   27 | P a g e  \n 2. Uncooperative public authorities:  Transporting access to and providing services in \nMozambique involves cooperation from numerous public authorities, whether in order to obtain \nthe documentation necessary to im port assets or receive visa for staff. This was often not \nforthcoming, and performance suffered as a result.  \n3. Security and environmental issues:  the security issues affecting Mozambique since 2013 \nand, at times, extreme weather conditions, have made impleme ntation a challenge.  \n4. Operational expenditure:  the Mozambique government did not provide the project companies \nwith any support for initial operational expenditure which would be expected in a project of this \nnature. \u201d \nThe Contractor provided Kroll with seve ral files of email correspondence to support the issues \nencountered, which are summarised in the main body of this report.  \n3.4  EMATUM: Key observations  \n3.4.1  Loan agreement  \nTable 4 provides a summary of the EMATUM loan agreement, including the total loan facility d rawn \ndown and the fees deducted by Credit Suisse and VTB Capital.  \n \nTable 4 | Summary of EMATUM loan  \nDetails  Amount  (USD)  Balance (USD)  \nTotal loan facility drawn down (Credit Suisse)  500,000,000   \nTotal loan facility drawn down (VTB  Capital)  350,000,000   \nTotal loan facility drawn down   850,000,000  \nArrangement Fees paid by EMATUM to Credit Suisse  (8,100,000)   \nArrangement Fees paid by EMATUM to VTB Capital  (5,600,000)   \nTotal \u201cArrangement Fees\u201d   (13,700,000)  \nSub-Total (\u201cContractor Portion\u201d)   836,300,000  \nContractor Fee paid by the Contractor to Credit Suisse  (45,000,000)   \nContractor Fee paid by the Contractor to VTB Capital  (31,500,000)   \nTotal \u201cContractor Fees\u201d   (76,500,000)  \nTotal payments to the Contractor account   759,800,000  \n Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   28 | P a g e  \n On 30 August 2013, EMATUM signed a loan agreement  with Credit Suisse with a maximum limit of \nUSD 850 million and a maturity period of seven years. The loan agreement was guaranteed by the \nGovernment of Mozambique, acting through the Ministry of Finance and Person C .  \nThe loan proceeds were utilised in two tranches on 5 September 2013 and 30 September 2013: \nthe first tranche of USD 500 million was rai sed by Credit Suisse with the second tranche of USD \n350 million raised by VTB Capital.  \nEMATUM authorised Credit Suisse and VTB Capital to deduct fees totalling USD 13.7 million for \narranging the loans. EMATUM also authorised Credit Suisse14  to withhold \u201cContractor Fees \u201d \ntotalling USD 76.5 million. As a result, the total loan proceeds remaining after the deduction of \nArrangement Fees and Contractor Fees was USD 759.8 million - this amount was paid to the \nContractor \u2019s bank account in the United Arab Emirates.  \nKroll was informed that the purpose of the Contractor Fees was the same as that for the ProIndicus \nloan agreements (refer to Section 3.3.2 above).  \nCredit Suisse stated to Kroll that as the bank did not retain any of the debt, \u201c\u2026virtually the entirety \nof the subvention fee was effectively passed on to note investors that purchased the debt \u201d and that \nthis was passed on to investors through the price at which the loan was sold to investors.  \nThe Contractor Fees of USD 76.5 million withheld by Credit Suisse wer e reduced by a \u201cContractor \nFee Rebate \u201d from Credit Suisse to the Contractor for USD 3.3 million (net). The Contractor Fee \nRebate of USD 4 million (gross) was calculated using a formula based on the average sale price \nCredit Suisse achieved on the EMATUM lo an notes, reduced by USD 748,500 due to a subsidy the \nContractor provided to a purchaser of USD 24.9 million of loan notes. Kroll has requested details \nof the purchaser of these notes from the Contractor - no information has been provided at the time \nof re porting . \n3.4.2  Fees paid to advisors in relation to EMATUM loan restructure  \nThe Ministry of Finance provided Kroll with a document summarising all fees paid in relation to the \nApril 2016 EMATUM debt restructuring. The document details payments totalling USD 31.4  million \nto twelve parties, including USD 17.3 million to a BNI Mozambique  and Ernst & Young consortium \n(the \u201cConsortium \u201d). The Ministry of Finance provided Kroll with evidence that it paid USD 31.4 \nmillion to the Consortium. Kroll has not received any evi dence to show that the proceeds were \ndistributed, as stated in the document, by the Consortium to the twelve parties.  \nTable 5 summarises the payments made by the Ministry of Finance and the role of each party in \nthe restructuring, as indicated in the docum ent provided by the Ministry of Finance:  \n \n14 Note: Credit Suisse assigned the Contractor Fees payable under the second tranche to VTB Capital.

The document sets out the terms \nfor the provision of services and states that pursuant to these service s, the Ministry of Finance \nagreed to pay the following success fees  for the : \n\uf0b7 Amount debt raised (2%);  \n\uf0b7 Amount of notes exchanged (2%); and,  \n\uf0b7 Amount of equity if raised (2%).  \n \n15 Note: The amounts are equivalent to the totals indicated in the table provided by the Ministry of Finance,  which is comprised by: \u201cfees, \nexpenses and interests due and associated expenses.\u201d  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   30 | P a g e  \n Kroll has requested further information about the services provided by the Consorti um and \npayments from the Ministry of Finance - no information was provided at the time of reporting.  \nN\u00b0 2 and N\u00b05: Credit Suisse and VTB Capital received payments totalling USD 6,193,827, due to \ntheir role as arrangers in restructuring the EMATUM loan.   \nA \u201cDealer Management \u201d agreement, dated 9 March 2016, named Credit Suisse Securities and VTB \nCapital as joint dealers on the sovereign bond offering. The Dealer Management agreement stated \nthat Credit Suisse would receive USD 3 million and VTB Capital would r eceive USD 2 million in \nfees as dealer managers, as well as payment for other costs and expenses up to a maximum of \nUSD 580,000.  \nThere is a USD 613,827 difference between the amount paid to Credit Suisse and VTB Capital and \nthe amount indicated in the Dea ler Management agreement. The reason for this difference is \nunknown and Kroll has not been provided with any evidence to support the payments to Credit \nSuisse and VTB Capital.  \nN\u00b0 3: It appears that Palomar was paid USD 3,767,757 by the Ministry of Finance due to its role as \nexternal advisor in the restructuring of the EMATUM debt.  \nThe rationale for the payment to Palomar is unknown and Kroll has not been provided with any \nevidence of an agreement between Palomar and the Consortium or the Ministry of Finance . The \nrole of Palomar is discussed in more detail at Section 3.7.  \nN\u00b0 4 and N\u00b0 6 through to N\u00b0 12: These payments appear to be for other services provided in \nrelation to the EMATUM loan restructuring, such as legal advisory.  \nThe Ministry of Finance informed Kroll that the Consortium stated it had the support of several \nentities throughout the restructuring process, and requested payments to these entities. Kroll has \nnot been provided with any further details in relation to these payments.  \n3.4.3  Revenue projections  \nAccording to a \u201cMozambique Fishing Feasibility Study \u201d prepared in July 2013, EMATUM was \nexpected to generate estimated annual operating revenues from fishing of USD 224 million by \nDecember 2016, which after operating costs of USD 32.1 million would leave \u201ccashflow available \nfor debt service \u201d of USD 192 million.  \nBased on the EMATUM Financial Statements for 2014 , EMATUM only generated MZN 460,541 \n(USD 14,268) in fishing revenues in 2014, and the fish was sold at a substantial loss. The fishing \nvessels are not currently operational for several reasons, discussed in further detail in the body of \nthis report.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   31 | P a g e  \n 3.4.4  Payments from Logistics International to EMATUM  \nOn 19 September 2013 and 2 December 2014, two payments totalling USD 4.2 million were \nreceived into EMATUM accounts in Mozambique from bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates \nin the name of Logistics International, 16 a Privinvest Group company. The 2013 and 2014 audited \nfinancial statements for EMATUM stated that these payments were provided by the Contractor to \nmeet operational expenses until the fishing vessels were generating revenue.  \nKroll has requested further details of written agreements between EM ATUM and the Contractor to \nsupport these payments, however no documentation has been provided at the time of reporting . \n3.4.5  Payments to EMATUM for interest payments  \nIn 2014, the first two interest payments totalling USD 51.8 million were due to Credit Suisse. On 21 \nFebruary 2014, Credit Suisse sent an interest payment notice to EMATUM advising that USD 25 \nmillion was due for payment. On 18 August 2014, a further interest payment notice was sent to \nEMATUM advising that USD 26.8 million was due for payment.  \nKroll identified an undisclosed Moza Banco account held by EMATUM, which was not recorded in \nthe accounting records of EMATUM for the period 2013 to 2016. Kroll \u2019s analysis of the Moza Banco \naccount identified two transfers received from a SISE bank account, wh ich were subsequently used \nto make the two interest payments (totalling USD 51.8 million) directly to Credit Suisse in 2014.  \nOn 22 March 2015, the Contractor  sent a signed letter to EMATUM which stated \u201cAbu Dhabi Mar \nhereby confirms that it has made total  payments to EMATUM \u2019s lenders in excess of USD$ \n53,000,000 (USD Dollars Fifty Three million) .\u201d The 22 March 2015 letter, which was provided to \nErnst & Young as part of their audit, implies that the Contractor made direct payments to Credit \nSuisse and VTB C apital totalling in excess of USD 53 million.  \nOn 23 March 2015, the Directors of EMATUM signed an audit representation letter to Ernst & Young \nas part of their 2014 audit in which they stated that \u201cthe supplier Abu Dhabi Mar LLC made an \nadvancement of USD 53,000,000 through [\u2026] the direct payment to Credit Suisse of USD \n51,753,542 direct payment \u201d to fund the interest payments due which comprised USD 31.5 million \nowed by EMATUM and USD 20.2 million \u201cthat was assumed by the State shareholder .\u201d The letter \nstated that the remaining funds, USD 1.2 million, were used for a payment to \u201canother entity. \u201d  \nOn 25 March 2015, the EMATUM Financial Statements for 2014  were finalised and recorded a \nliability to the Contractor of MZN 1.8 billion (USD 53 million) which \u201c\u2026relates to an advancement \nof USD 53 million provided to EMATUM for the payment of the first interest due in March and \nSeptember 2014.\u201d   \n \n16 Note: Logistics International refers to Logistics International SAL (Offshore) and Logistics International Investments.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   32 | P a g e  \n The audit representation letter and audited financial statement notes imply that USD 53 million was \npaid directly by the  Contractor to Credit Suisse to settle the first interest payments due in March \n2014 and September 2014. However, this contradicts banking records provided to Kroll that show \nthe interest payments were made from the EMATUM Moza Banco bank account, and were  funded \nby transfers from SISE. The s ource of the SISE funds was a Bank of Mozambique bank account, \nopened at the request of the Ministry of Finance. It is possible that the representations made by \nthe directors of EMATUM in the audit representation letter  regarding the mechanism to to settle the \nfirst interest payments are incorrect.  \nKroll has requested an explanation from Person A  in relation to this discrepancy. Person A , in a \nletter to Kroll dated 8 March 2017, stated that \u201cWe are still trying to unders tand along with the \nsupplier the objectives of this amount.\"  Kroll has requested information from EMATUM and the \nContractor  to evidence any agreements in relation to the USD 53 million payment, however no \ninformation has been provided. N o documentation has  been provided to identify the entity which \nreceived the USD 1.2 million payment , nor the rationale for the payment.  \nKroll was informed by the Ministry of Finance that EMATUM defaulted on the latest interest payment \ndue on 18 January 2017 (USD 119.4 milli on). \n3.4.6  Scope of supply  \nOn 2 August 2013 EMATUM signed a USD 785.4 million supply contract (hereafter the \u201cEMATUM \nSupply Contract \u201d) with the Contractor for the supply of twenty four fishing vessels, three Ocean \nEagle vessels, equipment for a Land Operations C oordination Centre, training, intellectual property \nand support to enable the company to construct the ordered vessels in the future.  \nOn 26 September 2013, the Contractor  and EMATUM agreed to increase the total price of the \nsupply contract by USD 51 millio n to USD 836.4 million. The amendment to the supply contract \ndoes not specify any changes to the scope or supply or terms of the initial contract. Kroll has not \nbeen provided with an explanation for this significant price increase.  \nThe supply contract onl y required the Contractor to provide an invoice for the full price of the \ncontract and did not require them to provide detailed invoices listing the price of each asset and \nservice provided. At the request of EMATUM, the Contractor provided a one page document \n(hereafter the \u201cEMATUM Invoice \u201d) dated 25 March 2015 which set out the assets still be delivered \nas of 31 December 2014. An extract of the EMATUM Invoice is provided at Figure 2.  \n  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   33 | P a g e  \n Figure 2 | Extract of EMATUM Invoice  \n \nThe Contractor has stated that the EMATUM Invoice is the only document required to be provided \nfor the total value of the contract. The EMATUM Invoice differs from a similar invoice provided to \nErnst & Young for the 31 December 2014 statutory audit that incl uded three HSI32 Interceptor \nvessels, which are not part of the EMATUM Supply Contract.  \nKroll was informed by an industry expert that invoices should include a clear and detailed \ndescription of all assets and services provided. The invoices provided to Kroll do not provide \nsufficient detail to gain comfort that the documents accurately reflec t the true price of these assets \nand services, and therefore do not allow accurate accounting records t o be maintained by the \ncompany.  \nKroll discusses in Section 9 of this Report how the limited invoice documentation gives rise to \npotential breaches of cer tain Articles in the Mozambique Commercial Code by the Mozambique \nCompanies.  \nKroll has compiled the following asset and service price list based on invoices provided by the \nContractor to EMATUM as well as invoices prepared for customs purposes:  \nTable 6 | Summary of scope of supply for EMATUM  \nDetails  Stated price per unit \n(USD)  Units provided  Total Price  \nLongliner fishing vessels  22,302,000  21  468,342,000  \nBait Trawler fishing vessels  22,302,000  3  66,906,000  \nOcean Eagle vessels17 Est. 73,410,000  3 Est. 220,230,000  \nEquipment Centre  Unstated  1 80,822,000  \n \n17 Note: EMATUM provided Kroll with invoices for th e twenty -four fishing vessels, each for USD 22.3 million (i.e. a total of USD 535.2 \nmillion). The USD 535.2 million total, added to USD 80.8 million for the Equipment Centre, Intellectual property and Spare parts and \ntraining , leaves a balance of USD 220.2  million from the USD 836.3 million contract value.  \nProject Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   34 | P a g e  \n Intellectual property  Unstated  1 \nSpare parts and training  Unstated  1 \nTotal   836,300,000  \n \n3.4.7  Asset verification  \nKroll visited several locations in Mozambique to verify the existence of the assets to be delivered \nper the EMATUM Supply Contract, and confirmed the existence of twenty -one Longliner vessels \nand three Trawlers in Maputo and three Ocean Eagle vessels in Pemba. Similar to the ProIndicus \ncontract, none of the assets are fully operational for several reasons, including a lack of trained \ncrew to operate the vessels, and the limitation on available working capital.  \nKroll has not verified the existence of i) a secured site for the Land Operations Coordination Centre \nor ii) the equipment for the centre. The Privinvest Presentation  stated that this equipment was \ndelivered, but that the installation and commissioning of the equipment had not occurred due to the \nfailure of EMATUM to procure a site for the Coordination Centre, or to provide personnel to \nundertake the necessary training.  \nFurther, the Contractor stated in the Mozambique Presentation that two of the three Camcopter \ndrones, due to be supplied with the Ocean Eagle vessels, were not delivered due to failures by \nEMATUM  to provide appropriate staff for training as required under the contract. Kroll has not \nreceived any further details from EMATUM regarding the location of the remaining Camcopter drone \nwhich was purportedly delivered to Mozambique in September 2014. The price of each Camcopter \ndrone is not known.  \n3.4.8  Discrepancies in explanation of USD 500 million expenditure  \nThe Independent Audit has established that there are inconsistencies between explanations \nprovided by Person A , the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Defence and the Contractor regarding \nthe actual use of USD 500 million of the loan proceeds.  \nKroll was informed by the Ministry of Finance that USD 500 million of the EMATUM loan was \nintegrated into the national budget in 2014. The Role H , Person H , inform ed Kroll that the transfer \noccurred in 2013 during discussions regarding the budget proposal for 2014. Initially, only USD 350 \nmillion of the loan was transferred, with an additional USD 150 million allocated at a later date.  \nA document published by the IM F, entitled \u201cStaff Report for the 2015 Article IV Consultation, fifth \nreview under the Policy Support Instrument \u201d states that the Government of Mozambique \nguaranteed a USD 850 million bond issued in 2013 by EMATUM to finance the purchase of tuna \nfishing bo ats and maritime security equipment. The document states that subsequently USD 500 Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   35 | P a g e  \n million was incorporated into the State budget for the maritime security equipment, and became \npublic debt under the responsibility of the Treasury.  \nThe Ministry of Finance  has not been able to confirm to Kroll any details of the maritime security \nequipment that were effectively included in the USD 500 million allocation, nor if the USD 500 \nmillion integration into the national budget has actually been completed.  \nSeparately,  Person A stated to Kroll that USD 500 million of the loan proceeds were used to \npurchase military equipment. Kroll has raised the question of how the loan proceeds were used by \nthe Ministry of Defence with Person A on several occasions, who in turn has st ated that financial \ninformation and documentation supporting any confidential military expenditure is outside the scope \nof the Independent Audit. Person A has further stated that this is classified information held by \nSISE.  \nPerson A , in further support of this statement, provided Kroll with an unsigned draft letter dated 5 \nDecember 2016 purportedly from Person I , the Role I . The letter stated:  \n\u201cFor all legal and consequent effects, we confirm that the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of \nMozambique receiv ed, in the scope of the \u201cEMATUM project \u201d, military equipment in the total amount \nequal to USD 500,000.00 [sic] (five hundred million US dollar), aiming to boost the capacities for \nthe protection of national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the invio lability of national borders. \u201d18 \nKroll met with Role I to discuss the draft letter. Role I explained to Kroll that  he/she was aware of \nthe draft letter, but refused to sign the letter as  he/she was unaware of what, if any, military \nequipment was provided to  the Ministry of Defence.  \nThe Contractor has categorically stated to Kroll that the assets delivered to EMATUM were per the \nagreed supply contract and specifically that no weapons were provided.  \nKroll has requested that both the Role E , Person E  and the Role F , Person F , provide further details \non what military equipment was procured for the Ministry of Defence. Person E  stated that SISE \nwas unable to provide any information to Kroll.  Person F  has informed Kroll that no records relating \nto the Mozambique C ompanies have been provided to  him/her since  he/she took office.  \nIn order to verify how the USD 500 million loan proceeds were actually allocated, a framework that \npreserves the confidentiality of relevant information needs to be established or the relevan t parties \nneed to waive confidentiality. This will enable Kroll to be provided with further documentation from \nthe Contractor explaining the pricing structure of the EMATUM Supply Contract, without breaching \nthe terms of the contract.  \n \n18 Note: The reference to \u201cUSD 500,000.00 (five hundred million US dollar\u201d is quoted verbatim.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   36 | P a g e  \n 3.4.9  Issues encountered b y Contractor in delivering the supply contract  \nThe Contractor  provided Kroll with a comprehensive overview, along with supporting \ndocumentation, of contract obligations not fulfilled by EMATUM management in respect of the \nEMATUM Supply Contract. These issu es are stated to have impacted on the Contractor \u2019s ability to \nfulfil its contractual obligations and to have caused delays to the delivery of the EMATUM Project.  \nThe Privinvest Presentation  stated that the key issues include i) non -completion of crew train ing \nfor the Ocean Eagle vessels and Camcopter drones, and ii) the non -provision of a site for the Land \nOperations Coordination Centre.  \nFurther, correspondence provided by the Contractor to Kroll indicates that EMATUM i) had not \nestablished an onshore stor age facility that would enable the company to store fish at the correct \ntemperature, ii) had not maintained the vessels supplied as advised by the Contractor , and iii) had \nmade alterations to the vessels which impacted the ability to claim under the contra ctual warranty.  \nOn the basis of the evidence provided, it appears that the absence of a Land Operations \nCoordination Centre and the shortage of properly trained crew is a result of inaction and failures \nby management of the Mozambique Companies to perform their duties, and that these failings have \ncontributed to, and continue to impact, EMATUM \u2019s inability to generate operational revenues.  \n3.4.10  Intellectual property and transfer of technology  \nThe supply contract also references the transfer of an intellectual pr operty licence to EMATUM. \nThe EMATUM Supply Contract stated that this licence would enable EMATUM to have the capability \nto build fishing vessels and Ocean Eagle vessels at an agreed site within Mozambique. Further, \nthe contract  stated that EMATUM required  the prior  consent of the Contractor to supply these \nvessels to  countries other than  the Republic of  Mozambique.  \nKroll was not provided with any further details of the intellectual property licence, including the \nvalue apportioned to the licence as part of  the overall contract. The accounting records provided to \nKroll do not show intellectual property recognised as an asset - this is potentially a breach of Article \n42 of the Commercial Code (please refer to Section 9).  \n3.5  MAM: Key observations  \n3.5.1  Loan agreement  \nTable 7 provides a summary of the MAM loan agreement, including the total loan facility drawn \ndown and the fees deducted by VTB Capital.  \n  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   37 | P a g e  \n Table 7 | Summary of MAM loan fees  \nDetails  Fees (USD)  Amount (USD)  \nTotal loan facility drawn  down (VTB Capital)   535,000,000  \nArrangement Fees paid by MAM to VTB Capital  (35,000,000)   \nTotal payments to the Contractor account    500,000,000  \n \nOn 20 May 2014, MAM signed a loan agreement with a limit of USD 540 million with VTB Capital. \nThe MAM Loan Agreement was arranged by Palomar and VTB Capital, and was facilitated by VTB \nCapital. The loan agreement was guaranteed for the full amount by the G overnment of Mozambique, \nacting through the Ministry of Finance and Person C . \nOn 23 May 2014 and 11 June 2014, USD 535 million of the loan facility was utilised in tranches of \nUSD 435 million and USD 100 million, with all of the funds provided by VTB Capit al.  \nMAM agreed arrangement fees of USD 35 million with VTB Capital. As a result, the total loan \nproceeds remaining after the deduction of arrangement fees was USD 500 million - this amount \nwas paid to the Contractor \u2019s bank account in the United Arab Emira tes. \nAn Arrangement Fee letter dated 23 May 2014 stated that no other annual or periodic fees were \npayable in relation to the loan agreement. Unlike the ProIndicus and EMATUM loan agreements, \nno Contractor Fees were payable by the Contractor. However, the Privinvest Presentation stated \nthat the Ministry of Finance requested the Contractor \u201c\u2026to subsidise the cost of the MAM financing \nby undertaking to fund the first year of interest of the MAM loan \u201d which the Contractor stated it did \nat its own cost. The MAM  loan agreement showed that the interest rate was higher than the interest \nrates charged on the ProIndicus and EMATUM loans.  \nOn 27 May 2015, following a request from Person A , Palomar made an interest payment of USD \n40.8 million to VTB Capital on behalf of  MAM. Kroll has not been provided with any documentation \nto evidence an agreement by the Contractor to pay the first year \u2019s interest on behalf of MAM.  \nKroll was informed by the Ministry of Finance that MAM defaulted on principal and interest \npayments tota lling USD 175.5 million due on 23 May 2016.  \n3.5.2  Revenue projections  \nThe MAM Business Plan stated that the company was expected to generate estimated operating \nrevenues of USD 63.7 million at the end of Year 1, and that, after loan interest of USD 48.6 million  \nwas deducted, \u201ccashflow available for debt service \u201d would be USD 15.9 million.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   38 | P a g e  \n At the time of reporting, MAM has not generated any operating revenues other than USD 25,000 \ngenerated in 2017 for transporting goods on the African Storm  \u201cDual Purpose Vessel \u201d, a deal which \nwas arranged and managed by the Contractor.  \nThe basis for the revenue projections was: income from maintenance services for the vessels \nowned by ProIndicus and EMATUM; construction of vessels; and servicing of commercial vessels \nfor offshor e oil and gas companies. The construction of vessels equated to over 70% of the \nestimated revenue for MAM from Year 2 of the contract. Kroll has not received any documentation \nto support the estimated revenues.  \nThe MAM Business Plan was, in part, based on planned agreements with ProIndicus and EMATUM \nfor the servicing of certain vessels classified as \u201cGovernment Vessels. \u201d19  The Contractor has \nprovided Kroll with documentation that indicates that MAM did not enter into any agreements with \nProIndicus or EMATUM  for the servicing of Government Vessels in a timely manner.  \n3.5.3  Scope of supply  \nOn 1 May 2014, MAM signed a USD 500 million supply contract (hereafter the \u201cOriginal MAM \nSupply Contract \u201d) with the Contractor for the supply of the following assets and services:  \n\uf0b7 Construction and fit out of a shipyard in Pemba;  \n\uf0b7 Construction of eighteen DV15 Interceptor vessels;  \n\uf0b7 Upgrade of two existing facilities in Maputo and Beira to provide maintenance and servicing to \nthe ProIndicus and EMATUM vessels, as well as offshore oil a nd gas vessels;  \n\uf0b7 Management of the Pemba Shipyard and the Maputo and Beira facilities for a two year period;  \n\uf0b7 Transfer of the intellectual property licences and technologies to enable the construction of the \nDV15 Interceptor, HSI32 Interceptor and WP18 Interceptor vessels. The contract also provided \nfor the transfer of intellectual property for the fishing vessels and Ocean Eagle vessels from \nEMATUM to MAM (for no payment to the Contractor);  \n\uf0b7 Provision of a Dual Purpose Vessel, and associated crew, for a period of two years; and,  \n\uf0b7 Training of local personnel to enable them to undertake maintenance services and construction \nin the future.  \nOn or around 22 December 2014, MAM and the Contractor agreed to amend the supply contract \n(hereafter the \u201cAmended MAM Sup ply Contract \u201d) to reflect the ongoing challenges experienced by \n \n19 Note: \u201cGovernment Vessels\u201d are defined as DV15 Interceptors, HSI32 Interceptors, WP18 Interceptor, Ocean Eag le and the fishing \nvessels.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   39 | P a g e  \n the Contractor in relation to delivering the project in Mozambique. The Amended MAM Supply \nContract  revised  the scope of supply to include:  \n\uf0b7 Fit out of two maintenance and servicing bases to be  located in Pemba and Maputo;  \n\uf0b7 Upgrade of one of these bases to enable \u201cbasic steelwork and ship assembly activities \u201d; \n\uf0b7 Provision of a \u201cDual Purpose Vessel, \u201d the \u201cAfrican Storm \u201d and associated crew, for a period of \ntwo years, with the vessel to be sold to MA M for USD 1 after this period;  \n\uf0b7 Fit out of the Mozambique Maritime Institute (a training facility), to be co -located in two existing \nfacilities at the Pemba Naval School and Maputo Nautical School;  \n\uf0b7 Delivery of training at the Mozambique Maritime Institute f or maintenance and operations of \nthe vessels supplied to EMATUM and MAM; and,  \n\uf0b7 Transfer of intellectual property licences and technology as set out in the Original MAM Supply \nContract.  \nThe Amended MAM Supply Contract  only required the Contractor to provide an invoice for the full \nprice of the contract and did not require them to provide detailed invoices listing the price of each \nasset and service provided. At Kroll \u2019s request, MAM obtained from the Contractor an undated \n\u201cGlobal Invoice \u201d (hereafter the \u201cMAM I nvoice \u201d) for the Amended MAM Supply Contract  which \nprovided \u201cConfirmation of deliverables \u201d with a total value of USD 500 million. An extract of the MAM \nInvoice is included at Figure 3.  \nFigure 3 | Extract of MAM Invoice:  \n \nKroll was  informed by an industry expert that invoices should include a clear and detailed \ndescription of all assets and services provided. The invoices provided to Kroll do not provide \nsufficient detail to gain comfort that the documents accurately reflect the tru e price of these assets \nand services, and therefore do not allow proper accounting records to be maintained by the \ncompany. Kroll discusses in Section 9 of this Report how the limited invoice documentation gives \nProject Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   40 | P a g e  \n rise to potential breaches of certain Articl es in the Mozambique Commercial Code by the \nMozambique Companies.  \n3.5.4  Asset verification  \nKroll  verified that the Pemba Shipyard is partially fitted out, and the Contractor has stated that the \nsite became operational around June 2016. Kroll has not been able to  verify the capabilities of \nMAM to deliver the anticipated services at this site.  \nKroll  has not physically verified the existence of the Maputo Shipyard - at the time of completing \nthe Independent Audit, access was not available to the Shipyard and the Contractor stated to Kroll \nthat work was ongoing to upgrade and fit out this facility, a p rocess which has been delayed due to \nfailures by MAM to provide access to the facility.  \nKroll  verified the existence of the Dual Purpose Vessel, the African Storm , in Pemba and the \nContractor provided evidence to show that the title of the vessel would be transferred to MAM on \n31 May 2017.  \nKroll  attended the site of the Pemba Naval School which was partially completed. At the time of \nKroll \u2019s visit [Redacted] , a [Redacted] , was engaged to deliver operator training for the vessels. Kroll \nwas provided with a t our of the training facility, which included several mock vessel cockpits. Kroll \nwas informed by the Contractor that the planned training courses have been considerably delayed \ndue to failure by MAM to supply suitable candidates.  \n3.5.5  Intellectual property and  transfer of technology  \nThe Original MAM Supply Contract provided for the transfer of intellectual property licences and \nassociated technology transfers from the Contractor to MAM, to allow MAM to construct DV15 \nInterceptors, HSI32 Interceptors and WP18 In terceptor vessels in Mozambique. Further, intellectual \nproperty licences and associated technology transfers for the fishing vessels and Ocean Eagle \nvessels, provided to EMATUM under the EMATUM Supply Contract, were to be transferred to MAM.  \nThe Amended MA M Supply Contract stated that the intellectual property licences for the \naforementioned vessels were transferred to MAM by the date of the contract (22 December 2014). \nThe Amended MAM Supply Contract also stated that the associated technology transfer to e nable \nMAM to assemble the vessels, rather than construct them as stated in the Original MAM Supply \nContract, would be provided at a later date at no additional cost \u2013 it is not known if this transfer has \nactually occurred.  \nFurthermore, Kroll was not provid ed with any evidence to show that the intellectual property \nlicences for the fishing vessels and Ocean Eagle vessels were transferred by EMATUM to MAM as \nprovided for in the Original MAM Supply Contract. The intellectual property licences and technology \nrights have not been recognised as an asset in the accounting records of either company.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   41 | P a g e  \n 3.5.6  Payments from Logistics International to MAM  \nOn 2 July 2014 a payment of USD 999,967 was received into a MAM bank account in Mozambique \nfrom a Logistics International bank account in the United Arab Emirates. Logistics International is \nthe same company which transferred funds to EMATUM in 2013. The reason for this payment is \nunknown. Kroll has requested further information from the Contractor, but has not been provided \nwith any evidence of an agreement between the Contractor and MAM to support this payment.  \n3.5.7  Issues with deliverables  \nThe Contractor  provided Kroll with a comprehensive overview, along with supporting \ndocumentation, of contract obligations not fulfilled by MAM management in respect of the MAM \nsupply contract. These issues are stated to have impacted on the Contractor \u2019s ability to fulfil its \ncontractual obligations under the Amended MAM Supply Contract which is due to expire on 31 May \n2017, at which point the Con tractor, in the absence of further extensions, will not be required to \nprovide any further services under the supply contract.  \nThe Contractor stated in the Privinvest Presentation that the key issues included:  \n\uf0b7 Sites:  MAM was severely delayed in procuring a ccess and control of the sites required for the \nproject.  \n\uf0b7 Permits and Authorisations:  MAM had not procured the necessary permits and authorisations \nfor the sites and the installation of certain equipment onsite (e.g. pontoons).  \n\uf0b7 Visas:  MAM had not procured v alid work visas for Contractor personnel.  \n\uf0b7 Customs Clearance:  MAM had not paid the customs duties due on certain containers, holding \nequipment and materials, or otherwise procured their timely release.  \n\uf0b7 Sub-Contractors:  MAM had not paid or managed the subcon tractors undertaking critical works \nat the Sites which must be completed before other operations could commence.  \nEmails enclosed in the correspondence files provided by the Contractor to Kroll provide evidence \nthe aforementioned issues. Kroll has not subst antiated the authenticity of the documents with the \nMozambique Companies, however there is no reason to doubt their veracity.  \n3.6  Price comparison of assets and services  \nThe Independent Audit has enabled Kroll to obtain an understanding of the key assets and services \nthat were contracted to be provided by the Contractor to the Mozambique Companies, including \nthe purported overall price of each contract. However, gaps remain in understanding how exactly \nthe USD 2 billion was spent, despite considerable efforts to close this gap.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   42 | P a g e  \n 3.6.1  Documents provided to Kroll  \nKroll has considered the price of assets and services delivered (or to be delivered) as part of the \nthree supply contacts between the Contractor and the Mozambique Companies. Limited documents \nhave been provided to Kroll by the Contractor and the Mozambique Companies to evidence the \nprice of assets and services. The documentation provided is summarised as follows:  \nProIndicus:  \n\uf0b7 A one page \u201cConfirmation of deliverables \u201d invoice listing assets and services totalling USD \n611,986,800 (the ProIndicus Invoice);  \n\uf0b7 Several invoices for the provision of: thirty -six DV15 Interceptor vessels; three WP18 \nInterceptor vessels; and sixteen radar stations. The prices stated in these individual asset \ninvoices correspond to t he one page \u201cConfirmation of deliverables \u201d invoice, and do not provide \nany further detail regarding the specification of the assets.  \nEMATUM:  \n\uf0b7 A one page invoice listing assets and services totalling USD 635,582,000 (the EMATUM \nInvoice); and,  \n\uf0b7 Several invoice s including a short specification for the provision of three Trawlers and twenty -\none Longliner vessels, each one priced at USD 22,302,000 (i.e., a total of USD 535,248,000).  \nThe EMATUM invoice only listed assets and services that were still to be delivered  under the supply \ncontract. Kroll has considered this invoice in the context of the assets that had already been \ndelivered to EMATUM at the time in order to calculate a total price of USD 836,300,000 for the \nassets and services to be provided under the sup ply contract, which corresponds with the price set \nout in the EMATUM Supply Contract.  \nMAM:  \n\uf0b7 A one page \u201cConfirmation of deliverables \u201d invoice listing assets and services totalling USD \n500,000,000 (the MAM Invoice) - the invoice does not provide specific pri ces for any assets or \nservices).  \nOther documents:  \nIn addition, ProIndicus provided Kroll with a copy of a ProIndicus Business Plan, dated 17 March \n2014, and MAM provided Kroll with a copy of an undated document entitled \u201cConstruction of \nShipyard and Coasta l Maintenance Bases \u201d (hereafter the \u201cMAM Business Plan \u201d). For clarity, the \nEMATUM Feasibility Study did not reference any prices for specific assets.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   43 | P a g e  \n The \u201cScope of Supply \u201d Sections in 3.3 to 3.5 above include extracts from the invoices provided by \nthe Cont ractor to ProIndicus, EMATUM and MAM for each supply contract.  \n3.6.2  Methodology to undertaking price comparison of assets and services  \nThe invoices provided to Kroll provide limited detail, if any, on the specification of individual assets \nor services. Where sp ecified in the invoices provided by the Contractor, the prices for certain assets \nand services do not correspond to the prices indicated in other documentation (as outlined below) \nprovided to Kroll as part of the Independent Audit.  \nFurther, the supply con tracts between the Contractor and the Mozambique Companies do not \nprovide any details of the pricing structure (for example, the costs allocated to training, \nmaintenance etc.). The Contractor stated in email communications to Kroll that no purchase orders \nor delivery notes were required under the terms of the contract.  \nBased on the documentation received, Kroll was not able to undertake a full valuation of the assets \nand services to be provided by the Contractor under the three supply contracts with the \nMozambique Companies. Instead Kroll, with the support of an independent expert, has sought to \nestimate the price discrepancy of the assets and services provided under each supply contract.  \nKroll has approached the price comparison of assets and services by co nsidering the prices stated \nin the invoices provided by the Contractor to the Mozambique Companies against:  \n1. The ProIndicus Business Plan;  \n2. The MAM Business Plan, and,  \n3. Estimated prices calculated by Kroll with the assistance of an independent expert.  \n3.6.3  Price c omparison of assets and services - ProIndicus Business Plan  \nThe ProIndicus Business Plan sets out different prices for several assets when compared to i) the \nprices stated in the invoices provided to ProIndicus by the Contractor and ii) the MAM Business \nPlan (discussed below).  \nTable 8 summarises the differences in asset prices for the DV15 Interceptor vessels, HSI32 \nInterceptor vessels, WP18 Interceptor vessels and Radar Stations. Kroll has focused on these \nspecific assets as they represent the greatest differences in price.  \n  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   44 | P a g e  \n Table 8 | Summary of asset price differences (ProIndicus invoice vs. ProIndicus Business Plan)  \nAssets  \u2116 ProIndicus \nInvoice - USD \n(Unit)  ProIndicus \nBusiness \nPlan - USD \n(Unit)  ProIndicus \nInvoice - USD \n(Total)  ProIndicus \nBusiness \nPlan - USD \n(Total)  Difference \u2013 \nUSD (Total)  \nDV15 Interceptor  36  7,200,000   7,645,000   259,200,000  275,220,000  16,020,000  \nHSI32 Interceptor  3  32,700,000   39,333,333   98,100,000  118,000,000  19,900,000  \nWP18 Interceptor  3  19,400,000   17,600,000   58,200,000  52,800,000  (5,400,000)  \nRadar Stations  16 7,400,000  3,830,000  118,400,000  61,280,000  (57,120,000)  \nTotal  533,900,000  507,300,000  26,600,000  \n \nThe analysis summarised in Table 8 shows a significant discrepancy in the price of the Radar \nStations - the reason for the different prices is not known, but it provides evidence of the difficulties \nfaced in obtaining an accurate price for the assets and services to be delivered under the ProIndicus \nSupply Contract for the purpo ses of the Independent Audit.  \nThe ProIndicus Business Plan also includes additional assets and services that are not detailed in \nthe invoice provided to ProIndicus by the Contractor, or the ProIndicus Supply Contract. For \nexample, the ProIndicus Business P lan includes \u201cIntellectual Property \u201d for a total price of USD \n38,920,000, which comprised USD 33,150,000 for intellectual property and transfer of technology \nfor interceptor  vessels, and USD 5,770,000 for management services.  \n3.6.4  Price comparison of assets and  services - MAM Business Plan  \nThe MAM Business Plan states that MAM will be the beneficiary of Intellectual Property and \nTransfer of Technology that will enable the construction of vessels to create a new revenue stream \nfor the Government of Mozambique. Th e MAM Business Plan includes a section entitled \u201cEstimated \nRevenues and Gross Profit from Construction of Vessels. \u201d  \nThe estimated revenues for three ProIndicus vessel types (DV15 Interceptor, HSI32 Interceptor \nand WP18 Interceptor) and two EMATUM vessel t ypes (Ocean Eagle and Longliner) were included \nin the MAM Business Plan and are summarised in Table 9. It is not clear from the MAM Business \nPlan if \u201cestimated revenues \u201d represents the price at which MAM would market and sell vessels that \nit had constructe d to potential customers, however for the purposes of this analysis, Kroll uses the \nterm \u201cprice \u201d when referring to \u201cestimated revenues. \u201d \nKroll compared  the prices stated in the invoices provided by the Contractor to ProIndicus and \nEMATUM against the prices  included in the MAM Business Plan. The prices included in the MAM \nBusiness Plan exclude the engine, software and electronics costs for each vessel - Kroll does not \nhave any information on these incremental costs.

For the purposes of this analysis, Kroll has classed the \nthree Trawler vessels as Longliner vessels, as they are based on the same design as the Longliner \nvessels and have been invoiced by the Contractor to EMATUM at the same price.  \nTable 11 | Summary of asset price differences (EMATUM Invoice vs. MAM Business Plan)  \nAssets  \u2116 EMATUM \nInvoice Price \n- USD (Unit)  MAM \nBusiness \nPlan Price      \n- USD (Unit)  EMATUM \nInvoice Price \n- USD (Total)  MAM \nBusiness \nPlan Price      \n- USD (Total)  Difference      \n- USD (Total)  \nOcean Eagle  3  73,410,000   21,000,000   220,230,000   63,000,000  157,230,000  \nLongliner  24  22,302,000   10,500,000   535,248,000   252,000,000  283,248,000  \nTotal  755,478,000  315,000,000  440,478,000  \n \nThe analysis illustrates that the difference between prices for the assets as stated in the invoices \nprovided to EMATUM by the Contractor, and the prices outlined in the MAM Business Plan total \nUSD 440,478,000.  \nKroll has not been able to determine the bas is on which the prices in the MAM Business Plan have \nbeen established, nor the costs of supplying the engine, software and electronics for each vessel. \nKroll recommends that further information is requested from the Contractor to explain the \ndifferences in  the prices.  \nIn addition to the EMATUM Invoice, EMATUM provided Kroll with separate invoices for the twenty -\nfour fishing vessels. Person A informed Kroll that the invoices were originally provided by the \nContractor to EMATUM for customs purposes. The invoi ces stated that the price of each fishing \nvessel was USD 22.3 million (i.e. a total of USD 535 .2 million) - these prices correspond with the \nEMATUM Invoice.  \nPerson A stated to Kroll, in a meeting on 25 November 2016 , that  the invoices for the fishing vessels \nconcealed the purchase of other assets. Subsequently, Person J  (on behalf of the Contractor), in \nan email dated 21 March 2017, stated to Person A \u201c\u2026that any suggestion that PISB [Privinvest]  or \nADM [Abu Dhabi Mar]  delivered hidden or secret assets is both completely untrue and potentially \nvery damaging to us. \u201d \n3.6.5  Price comparison of assets - independent expert  \nKroll, with the support of an independent expert, has sought to estimate the price discrepancy of \nthe assets and s ervices provided under each supply contract. The independent expert engaged by Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   47 | P a g e  \n Kroll has over 30 years \u2019 experience working in both a military and commercial environment, \nprimarily in sales and bid management for complex defence systems.  \nKroll has undertake n the following analysis solely for the purposes of seeking to understand the \nunderlying pricing structure of each supply contract, and as such the prices for assets and services \ndiscussed in the following sections cannot be verified without further inform ation from the \nContractor regarding the specification and pricing for individual assets and services. The Contractor \nhas stated that pricing information for the supply contracts is confidential and cannot be shared \nwithout a non -disclosure agreement being agreed with Kroll.  \nKroll has conducted the exercise to estimate the price discrepancy of the assets and services \nprovided under the ProIndicus and EMATUM Supply Contracts only. The customised nature of the \nMAM Project means that it is not possible to consi der comparable projects for the purposes of \nestimating the price discrepancy of the assets and services provided under the supply contract.  \nThis exercise has been undertaken to identify commercially equivalent assets and their \ncorresponding prices, using open source pricing information for a wide variety of comparable \ncontracts, and, where possible, direct enquiries to vessel manufacturers in Europe. The ability to \nprice contracts for assets and services in the defence industry is limited due to the lack o f open \nsource pricing information available, which is further compounded by incomplete information for \nthe specifications for the assets acquired by ProIndicus and EMATUM.  \n Price comparison of ProIndicus assets  \nTable 12 summarises the differences between t he prices of the DV15 Interceptor vessels, HSI32 \nInterceptor vessels and WP18 Interceptor vessels as stated in the invoices provided to ProIndicus \nby the Contractor, and the estimated prices for the same assets with reference to the analysis \nperformed by K roll\u2019s independent expert.  \nTable 12 | Summary of asset price differences (ProIndicus Invoice vs. Independent Expert)  \nAssets  \u2116 ProIndicus \nInvoice           \n- USD (Unit)  Independent \nExpert Price   \n- USD (Unit)  ProIndicus \nInvoice Price  \n- USD (Total)  Independent \nExpert Price   \n- USD (Total)  Difference      \n- USD (Total)  \nDV15 Interceptor  36  7,200,000   2,000,000   259,200,000   72,000,000  187,200,000  \nHSI32 Interceptor  3  32,700,000   8,000,000   98,100,000   24,000,000  74,100,000  \nWP18 Interceptor  3  19,400,000   20,000,000   58,200,000   60,000,000  (1,800,000)  \nTotal without turnkey multipliers (A)  415,500,000  156,000,000  259,500,000  \nTotal with turnkey multipliers (B)  415,500,000  385,700,000  29,800,000  \n Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   48 | P a g e  \n The analysis illustrates that the difference between prices for the assets as stated in the invoices \nprovided to ProIndicus by the Contractor, and the prices estimated by Kroll \u2019s independent expert \ntotal USD 259,500,000 (designated by (A) in Table 12).  \nHowever, it is important to note that considering the asset price in isolation will not provide an \naccurate reflection of the price of a turnkey contract such as the one agreed between ProIndicus \nand the Contractor. Kroll \u2019s independent expert has stated that the costs of delivering a nd integrating \nthe assets (including costs for bid preparation, project planning, systems integration and project \nmanagement), and by adding an appropriate profit margin for the project, could more than double \nthe price of the combined assets.  \nKroll has applied this approach using estimated multipliers calculated by the independent expert - \nthis approach would increase the price of the assets included in Table 12 from USD 156,000,000 \nto USD 385,700,000, thereby reducing the difference to USD 29, 800,000 (designated by (B) in \nTable 12) .  \n Price comparison of EMATUM assets  \nTable 13 summarises the differences between the prices of the Ocean Eagle vessels and Longliner \nvessels as stated in the invoices provided to EMATUM by the Contractor, and the esti mated prices \nfor the same assets with reference to the analysis performed by Kroll \u2019s independent expert.  \nFor the purposes of this analysis, Kroll has classed the three Trawler vessels as Longliner vessels, \nas they are based on the same design as the Longliner vessels and have been invoiced by the \nContractor to EMATUM at the same price.  \nTable 13 | Summary of asset price differences (EMATUM Invoice vs. Independent Expert)  \nAssets  \u2116 EMATUM \nInvoice           \n- USD (Unit)  Independent  \nExpert Price   \n- USD (Unit)  EMATUM \nInvoice Price \n- USD (Total)  Independent \nExpert Price   \n- USD (Total)  Difference      \n- USD (Total)  \nOcean Eagle  3  73,410,000   20,000,000   220,230,000   60,000,000   160,230,000  \nLongliner  24  22,302,000   2,000,000   535,248,000   48,000,000    487,248,000  \nTotal  755,478,000  108,000,000  647,478,000  \n \nThe analysis illustrates that the difference between prices for the assets as stated in the invoices \nprovided to EMATUM by the Contractor, and the prices estimated by Kroll \u2019s independent expert \ntotal USD 647,478,000.  \nThe EMATUM Supply Contract appears to have been structured as an asset -purchase contract, \nrather than the turnkey/systems integration project acquired by ProIndicus. Kroll has not had any \ninsight as to the underlying pricing model established for the EMATU M Supply Contract, and the Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   49 | P a g e  \n prices estimated by Kroll \u2019s independent expert are provided only as an indicative guide based on \nthe limited contractual information available.  \n3.6.6  Price comparison of other ProIndicus contractual assets  \nKroll \u2019s independent expert has raised several queries regarding the price of other assets to be \nprovided under the ProIndicus Supply Contract. In particular, the decision to procure the Remos \nGX aircraft has been highlighted as requiring further explanatio n by the Contractor.  \nThe original ProIndicus Supply Contract stated that two F406 light turboprop aircraft manufactured \nby Reims Aviation Industries would be provided. Kroll has conducted independent research which \nindicates that the list price of a brand  new F406 aircraft is approximately USD 2.5 million (therefore \nUSD 5 million for two aircraft). Minutes of a meeting dated 25 April 2013 between the Contractor \nand ProIndicus stated that the original scope of supply was amended to provide better coverage o f \nthe Exclusive Economic Zone. As a result, instead of the F406 aircraft ProIndicus received six \nRemos GX aircraft, which are not considered by Kroll \u2019s independent expert to be a typical Maritime \nPatrol Aircraft.  \nThe Remos GX is designated as a Light Spor t Aircraft and is subject to \u201cVisual Flight Rules \u201d which \nmeans that the aircraft is restricted in countries that impose international rules. The Remos GX \ncannot be flown under Instrument Flight Rules conditions (i.e., the aircraft cannot be flown with \nvisibility of less than 3 or 5 nautical miles), which will restrict the ability for the aircraft to be used \nby ProIndicus in inclement weather.  \nKroll \u2019s analysis indicates that the list price of a brand new Remos GX aircraft is approximately USD \n135,000. Howeve r, in order to modify the Remos GX aircraft with the necessary equipment to \nundertake a maritime role (for example adding cameras and maritime surveillance radars), it is \nestimated that the additional costs would be in the range of USD 600,000 per aircraft , or USD \n735,000 per aircraft in total. As summarised in Table 14, this is significantly less than the USD \n7,900,000 unit price stated in the invoice provided to ProIndicus by the Contractor, even when \napplying the same turnkey multipliers discussed in Sec tion 3.6.5.1. Further analysis is necessary \nto establish the actual costs of modifying the Remos GX aircraft for the purposes envisaged by the \nsupply contract.  \nTable 14 | Summary of asset price differences for aircraft (ProIndicus I nvoice vs. Independent Expert)  \nAsset  \u2116 ProIndicus \nInvoice           \n- USD (Unit)  Independent \nExpert Price   \n- USD (Unit)  ProIndicus \nInvoice Price \n- USD (Total)  Independent \nExpert Price  - \nUSD (Total)  Difference - \nUSD (Total)  \nRemos GX  6  7,900,000  735,000   47,400,000   4,410,000   42,990,000  \nTotal without turnkey multipliers (A)   47,400,000   4,410,000   42,990,000  \nTotal with turnkey multipliers (B)  47,400,000  10,892,700  36,507,300  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   50 | P a g e  \n 3.6.7  Price comparison of MAM assets and services  \nThe only documentation provided to MAM by the Contractor to explain the prices of the MAM supply \ncontract is the MAM Invoice that listed assets and services totalling USD 500,000,000. The invoice \ndid not provide specific prices for any assets or services.  \nKroll has verified that  the Pemba Shipyard has been partially fitted out, and the Contractor has \nstated that the site became operational in June 2016. Kroll has not physically verified the existence \nof the Maputo Shipyard and the Contractor has stated that work is ongoing to upg rade and fit out \nthis facility.  \nKroll has not been provided with any further documentation to indicate the prices for the \nconstruction works undertaken at the Pemba Shipyard or Maputo Shipyard, and the customised \nnature of the MAM Project means that it is not possible to consider comparable projects for the \npurposes of estimating the price discrepancy of the assets and services provided under the supply \ncontract. The MAM supply contract also includes the transfer of intellectual property and transfer \nof tec hnology to enable the construction of vessels to create a new revenue stream for the \nGovernment of Mozambique - the price apportioned to this transfer is not known.  \n3.6.8  Summary of price comparison findings  \nTable 15 combines Kroll \u2019s analysis in Table 10 through  to Table 14 by summarising the prices of \nassets and services in the invoices provided to ProIndicus and EMATUM by the Contractor, \ncompared to:  \n1. The prices for the same assets in the MAM Business Plan; and,  \n2. The estimated prices for the same assets by Kroll \u2019s independent expert (factoring in the turnkey \nmultiplier for the ProIndicus assets).  \nThe summary is limited to comparison of the DV15 Interceptor vessels, HSI32 Interceptor vessels \nand WP18 Interceptor vessels for ProIndicus, and the  Ocean Eagle vessels and Longliner vessels \nfor EMATUM, to give a sense of the discrepancies and unexplained differences caused by the lack \nof documentation provided to Kroll.  \n  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   51 | P a g e  \n Table 15 | Summary of comparison of prices for assets and services  \nAssets  ProIndicus / \nEMATUM Invoice \nPrice                           \n- USD (Total)  MAM Business Plan \nPrice                           \n- USD (Total)  Independent Expert \nPrice inc. multipliers \n- USD (Total)  \nProIndicus  415,500,000  220,500,000  385,700,000  \nEMATUM  755,478,000  315,000,000  108,000,000  \nMaritime Patrol Aircraft (Remos GX)  47,400,000  - 10,892,700  \nTotal   1,218,378,000   535,500,000   504,592,700  \nDifference to Contractor Invoices  - (682,878,000)  (713,785,300)  \n \nBoth the MAM Business Plan prices and the independent expert estimated prices identify material \ndifferences in the prices of the assets. There are several factors that will affect the pricing models \napplied by the Contractor, including the specification of  individual assets, the approach taken by \nthe Contractor to integrating the assets, the provision of the necessary auxiliary services, such as \ntraining and maintenance, the perceived risk of delivering the projects in a high -risk market, and \nthe profit mar gins applied to the project by the Contractor.  \nThe differences between prices of assets and services outlined in the invoices provided to \nProIndicus and EMATUM by the Contractor may be clearly explained by additional documentation \nfrom the Contractor. How ever, at the conclusion of Kroll \u2019s Independent Audit the differences remain \nunexplained and warrant further consideration . \n3.7  Privinvest Group and Palomar  \n3.7.1  The Privinvest Group and Palomar  \nThe Contractor stated in the Privinvest Presentation that they introdu ced Prolndicus to Credit \nSuisse following a written request from Role C . From 2013 the Privinvest Group became \nincreasingly involved in both negotiating the loan contracts (including subvention fees) for the \nMozambique Companies, and in providing financial  advice to the Mozambique Companies and the \nGovernment of Mozambique in relation to first managing the projects and then later advising on \nrestructuring the financing for the projects. Financial  advice was provided by Palomar which is part \nof the Privinves t Group. The Palomar corporate website describes itself as providing financial \nadvisory and asset management services.20 \n \n20 Source: http://www.plmr.com/ . Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   52 | P a g e  \n Person B is a Role B21 and documents show that  he/she advised the Ministry of Finance and the \nMozambique Companies on behalf of Palomar f rom 201 4 onwards in relation to the loan \nrestructure. Person B was previously a Role B  and was involved in negotiating the original loan \nagreements with ProIndicus.  \n3.7.2  Palomar and ProIndicus  \nPalomar has, at the time of reporting, received USD 7.9 million from the Ministry of Finance for \nproviding financial advice in relation to the ProIndicus loan agreement and it is contracted to receive \na total of USD 30.5 million. The payments made to Palomar by the Ministry of Finance relate to \n\u201cRunning  Fees \u201d for Palomar \u2019s involvement in the restructuring of the ProIndicus loans in December \n2014. No documentation was provided, at the time of reporting,  to understand the basis for the \nRunning Fees to be paid to Palomar or why its fees were larger than sim ilar fees due to Credit \nSuisse or VTB Capital.22 \nFurthermore, an agreement signed between Palomar and ProIndicus in 2013 made Palomar solely \nresponsible for generating revenues for ProIndicus and included a clause whereby Palomar was to \nreceive a proportion  of the future revenues of ProIndicus for a 10 year period, as follows:  \n\uf0b7 Exclusive Economic Zone Revenue Fees:  a sum of 10% of the gross amount received by \nProIndicus in relation to the Exclusive Economic Zone project \u201c\u2026and / or the services \nperformed by Pa lomar Advisers; \u201d and, \n\uf0b7 Income Fees:  a sum of 10% of the net income generated pursuant to investments made using \nExclusive Economic Zone revenue in each quarter. These investments were to be made by \nPalomar.  \nThe financial records of ProIndicus show that no revenues were generated by Palomar, but it would \nappear from the terms of the agreement that as and when ProIndicus does start generating \nrevenues, Palomar will then be entitled to a proportion of this revenue.23 \n3.7.3  Palomar and MAM  \nPalomar was involved in arra nging the MAM loan agreement with VTB Capital. Documentation \nsuggests that Palomar did not receive any fees for its involvement in arranging the loan agreement. \nThe circumstances surrounding this arrangement are unknown .  \n \n21 Note: Palomar Capital Advisors Ltd  \n22 Note: Following publication of the Summary Report, Palomar provided Kroll with a letter dated 4 December 2014 that sets out their role \nas financial advisors to ProIndicus for the purposes of refinancing the facility agreement. The letter references that fees p ayable would \nbe set out in subsequent \u201cFee Letters\u201d.  \n23 Note: Following publication of the Summary Report, Palomar provided Kroll with a letter dated 4 December 2014 that purportedl y \nterminated this agreement.  \n Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   53 | P a g e  \n A loan interest instalment of USD 40.8 million was paid to VTB Capital from a bank account in the \nname of Palomar. The only evidence provided in support of this payment is an undated letter from \nMAM to Palomar in which Person A references an agreement between MAM and the Contractor to \nmake  this payment. Kroll was not provided with a copy of this agreement and it is not currently \nknown why the Contractor agreed to pay USD 40.8 million due from MAM to VTB Capital, or why \nthe payment was made by Palomar.  \n3.7.4  Palomar and Legacy Advisors Limited  \nOn 18 October 2016 Palomar Capital Advisors Ltd was placed into administration. On 17 February \n2017 Palomar assigned its rights to receive the Running Fees to an entity called VR Global \nPartners, L.P., a company that appears to be registered in the Cayman Isl ands and part of the VR \nGlobal Capital Group.  \nIn 2016, Palomar was appointed as an advisor to the Ministry of Finance for the restructuring of \nthe Mozambique Companies loans. Also appointed as an advisor was an entity called Legacy \nAdvisors Limited (herea fter \u201cLegacy Advisors \u201d). The documentation reviewed shows that a \nrepresentative at Legacy Advisors was Person K , who was at the time, and continues to be at the \ntime of reporting, a Role K  in Mozambique.  \nNo documents have yet been provided to confirm the f ees paid to Legacy Advisors for the financial \nadvice it provided.  \n3.8  Government guarantees  \n3.8.1  Government guarantees and the Parliamentary Inquiry Commission  \nKroll  reviewed the government guarantees that were issued by the Mozambique Ministry of Finance \nin relat ion to the loans entered into by the Mozambique Companies.  \nSince the commencement of Kroll \u2019s Independent Audit, a Parliamentary Inquiry Commission (\u201cCPI\u201d) \nreport has been published, which addressed the government guarantees and made a number of \nconclusions  regarding their legality.  \nIn this report Kroll has focused, as far as possible from the information available, an understanding \nthe process that was followed for authorising government guarantees in order to identify any \nirregularities or concerns regardi ng the process and to suggest any improvements that might be \nmade to strengthen this process.  \n3.8.2   Overview of findings  \nKroll was informed in discussions with Person C and Person H that the process for the Ministry of \nFinance to assess and issue government gua rantees is determined on a case by case basis.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   54 | P a g e  \n Between  February 2013 and December 2014, the Ministry of Finance authorised five separate \nguarantees totalling USD 2.2 billion for loans entered into or planned to be entered into by the \nMozambique Companies.  Table 16 summarises the documents provided to Kroll in respect of the \ngovernment guarantees issued. Where no date is shown, the respective document has not been \nprovided to Kroll.  \nTable 16 | Summary of government guarantee documen ts received (including. date of document)  \nRef Company  Request \nDocument  Opinion \nDocument  Government \nGuarantee  \n1 ProIndicus Original Loan Agreement  - 26/02/2013  28/02/2013  \n2 ProIndicus Amended Loan Agreement  10/05/2013  - 10/06/2013  \n3 EMATUM Loan Agreement  16/08/2013  - 30/08/2013  \n4 MAM Loan Agreement  25/04/2014  30/04/2014  20/05/2014  \n5 ProIndicus Final Loan Agreement  13/11/2014  - 17/12/2014  \n \nThere  does not appear to have been a documented or clearly understood process for issuing \ngovernment guarantees; this was complicated by the fact that the Mozambique Companies were \nincorporated as private companies. Kroll was informed by Person H that Companies  set up as state \nowned entities with loans treated as lending to the Government of Mozambique would have been \nsubjected to greater scrutiny by the Ministry of Finance.  \nApart from the initial government guarantee for ProIndicus which involved three governme nt \nofficials ( Person D , Person D , and Person L  (possibly a Role L ), the guarantees were only reviewed \nand approved by two government officials, namely Person C and Person D . There was no \ninvolvement of Parliament or the Administrative Court in the process of assessing or approving the \ngovernment guarantees.  \nThe Role E , Person E , and Person A , were both involved in  negotiating the approval for the \ngovernment guarantees. Considerable emphasis was placed on the secrecy of the projects and \nbecause SISE claimed that they were a matter of national security, the documentation forming the \nbasis of the government guarantee requests was subjected to less scrutiny. In addition, the \nindividuals approving the government guarantees were warned by those requesting the \ngove rnment guarantees not to involve anyone else in the approval process.  \nFurthermore, for  the second and third government guarantee granted to ProIndicus (with a total \nvalue of USD 528 million), no documentation was provided by the Ministry of Finance to show  that \nany assessment of the guarantee request took place prior to the Role  C approving the guarantee. Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   55 | P a g e  \n Likewise, no evidence was provided to Kroll that any Ministry of Finance assessment was \nundertaken prior to the approval of the USD 850 million guarantee for the EMATUM loan.  \nA letter dated 13 November 2014 from Person E , on behalf of SISE, to the Ministry of Finance, \nconfirmed that despite borrowing USD 622 million, ProIndicus had not commenced operations at \nthat point in time and therefore was not generat ing any revenues to pay the amounts due under \nthe loans. In the letter, Person E  requested an additional government guarantee for USD 278 million \nstating that this would avoid triggering the original ProIndicus government guarantees.  \nPerson E \u2019s request for  a government guarantee shows that the additional loan funds were intended \nto be used to pay down the existing loan exposure rather than for additional assets and services \nunder the project. The letter states that the USD 278 million guarantee was to be in  favour of \nPalomar, which suggests that this was the proposed lender, although no documents were provided \nto confirm that this was the case. The government guarantee was issued in the favour of Credit \nSuisse, not Palomar, and was signed by Person C . It app ears that the underlying loan facility was \nnot utilised.  \nA document prepared by the Ministry of Finance suggests that Credit Suisse imposed a number of \n\u201cpreceding conditions \u201d that needed to be met before it would approve the loan financing, including \nthe r equirement to have the loan agreement approved by the Bank of Mozambique and checked \nby the Mozambique Administrative Court and that the \u201coperation \u201d24 needed to be reported to the \nIMF. Documentation provided suggests that these conditions were \u201covercome \u201d so that no court or \nBank of Mozambique approval was required and no reporting to the IMF was needed. Further \ndocumentation is needed to confirm how the lending proceeded without meeting the required \nconditions.  \n3.9  Management of the Mozambique Companies  \nThe Mozambique Companies are governed by individuals who do not appear to possess the \nnecessary qualifications, skills or experience to effectively deliver the Mozambique Project. Person \nA has informed Kroll that  he/she does not have prior experience of im plementing an infrastructure \nproject of this nature. Further, it appears that the key individuals responsible for the day to day \noperation of the Mozambique Companies do not possess the skills necessary to perform their \nfunction.  \nKroll has identified numer ous examples of potential breaches of fiduciary duties by the Directors of \nthe Mozambique Companies, which appear to have resulted in loan agreements and supply \ncontracts agreed under onerous terms. For example, the MAM loan agreement was approved by \nPerso n A on 1 May 2014, over a year after the first ProIndicus loan agreement was approved by \n \n24 Note: The word \u201coperation\u201d is a direct quote from the supporting document - the exact meaning is n ot clear.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   56 | P a g e  \n Person A and Person M . At the point of signing the MAM loan agreement, Person A would \npresumably have been aware that ProIndicus was not generating any income from ope rations, and \nthat the revenue estimates outlined in the MAM Business Plan (which tied directly to the success \nof ProIndicus) were not achievable.  \nKroll was not able to obtain reliable accounting records from the Mozambique Companies to enable \na proper asse ssment of the financial position of each company. Further, the Mozambique \nCompanies were unable to provide complete loan agreements or supply contracts to Kroll. \nConsequently, in order to complete the Independent Audit, Kroll had to request and obtain bank  \naccount information from several banks located in Mozambique, loan agreements from Credit \nSuisse and VTB Capital located in the United Kingdom, and supply contracts from the Contractor \nin the United Arab Emirates.  \nKroll \u2019s work has not identified a coheren t business plan to bring the assets for the Mozambique \nCompanies to an operational status which would enable them to generate revenue in the \nforeseeable future. Further, meetings with senior management from the Mozambique Companies \ndid not provide any furt her understanding about future plans to make the assets operational. Based \non the work undertaken by Kroll, it appears that the lack of leadership, combined with an unqualified, \ninexperienced and ineffectual project management team, has contributed signifi cantly to the failure \nof the Mozambique Project.  \n3.9.1  The Mozambique Commercial Code  \nDuring the Independent Audit, Kroll identified a number of potential shortcomings regarding the \nmanagement of the Mozambique Companies.  \nKroll has considered the overall managem ent of the Mozambique Companies against the \nMozambique Commercial Code Decree Law 2/2005 (\u201cCommercial Code \u201d), to identify any potential \nbreaches.25 The objective of this analysis was to assess the performance of management of the \nMozambique Companies in ful filling their fiduciary duties and not to provide any form of legal \nanalysis.  Section 3 (of Chapter 2) of the Commercial Code deals with Commercial bookkeeping. \nArticle 42 through to Article 61 addresses the general provisions and forms of bookkeeping for \nMozambique companies. Kroll \u2019s work has identified the following Articles relevant to the \nmanagement of the Mozambique Companies:  \n1. Article 42 (Obligation of commercial bookkeeping):  \n2. Article 43 (Mandatory books):  \n3. Article 119 (Loss of half the capital):  \n \n25 Note: The Attorney General's Office confirmed to Kroll that the Mozambique Commercial Code is the appropriate law for conside ring \nthe fiduciary duties of management.  Project Montague |  Independent Audit  \nPrivate and Co nfidential   57 | P a g e  \n 4. Artic le 150 (Duty of diligence):  \n5. Article 415 (Documents to be made available to shareholders):  \nOf particular relevance is that the Mozambique Companies were unable to provide a large \nproportion of the financial information and supporting documentation necessary  to complete the \nIndependent Audit.  \nSpecifically, the Mozambique Companies could not provide Kroll with complete and up -to-date \ncopies of the loan agreements and supply contracts. I nvoices provided to Kroll by the Mozambique \nCompanies did not include suffi cient detail to provide comfort that the documents accurately reflect \nthe true price of the assets and services . Further, certain assets are not recorded in the accounting \nrecords, for example, the Ocean Eagle vessels under the EMATUM Supply Contract.  \nFurther detail of potential management shortcomings against each specific Article listed above are \nprovided at Section 9.  \n3.9.2  Key findings relating to project planning and management  \nThe documentation reviewed during the Independent Audit points towards a small g roup of SISE \nand government officials, led by Person A , exercising control over the planning of the Mozambique \nProject.  \nThe infrastructure necessary to enable the successful implementation of the Mozambique Project \nwas not established prior to the agreeme nt of each supply contract. Specifically,  it appears that: \ninsufficient port facilities were available for the appropriate mooring, maintenance or repair of the \nvessels acquired by ProIndicus and EMATUM; there were no plans to construct a dry land \nprocessi ng and storage facility for EMATUM, and; land required for the construction of the shipyards \nas envisaged by the MAM supply contract had not been secured in a timely manner.  \nFurther, there appears to be several issues that have prevented the acquired asset s being \noperationalised, for example:  \n\uf0b7 Training of crew:  Kroll was informed by the Contractor  that insufficient personnel were \nprovided for training for vessels owned by both ProIndicus and EMATUM;  \n\uf0b7 Permits for fishing vessels:  Kroll was informed that the fishing vessels are currently unable \nto operate due to permits not being reissued; and,  \n\uf0b7 Expired satellite package:  A satellite package, agreed for the first three years of the project, \nhas expired, with no evidence that negotia tions for a new package have commenced. As a \nresult, the radar systems built into each asset cannot communicate with the central command \ncentres, and therefore the assets cannot be operationalised.  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nkroll.com  ", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
