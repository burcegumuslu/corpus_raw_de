Balakrish Nair is an Indian microbiologist. He dedicated his scientific career to the study of cholera. He was involved in the discovery of various groups of cholera pathogens. On the basis of his research results, he developed prevention strategies and a new generation of vaccines.\nCholera is an infection of the human small intestine caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The primary symptoms are heavy, watery diarrhoea and vomiting. If left untreated, these symptoms can lead to dehydration and a quick death. The disease is mainly spread through contaminated drinking water or food. Balakrish Nair analysed the genome of the pathogen and contributed to the understanding of its molecular epidemiology.\nThe disease is predominantly triggered by two groups of pathogens (serogroups), namely serogroups O1 and O139. In 1993, Balakrish Nair\u2019s research lead to the discovery of the cholera serogroup O139. In other work, he and his team identified and analysed a bacterial phylum of the O1 serogroup, known as biotype El Tor.\nBalakrish Nair\u2019s interdisciplinary research lead to a new generation of cholera vaccines. He continues to search for subtle forms of the pathogen and develops prevention and management strategies including for urban slums. Additionally, he uses his position in committees to educate people about the social connotations of the disease. After all, cholera breaks out in places without clean drinking water and where there is a lack of sanitary facilities. In this context, Balakrish Nair also works to advocate for education and combat poverty.", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["/en/leopoldina-home/", "javascript:void(0);",
