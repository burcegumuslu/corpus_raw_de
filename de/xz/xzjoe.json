Doing yoga and other gentle exercises help make you limber and stronger. However, headstands and shoulderstands should not be done\nif you already have osteoporosis.\nAvoid calcium vampires.\nCalcium vampires are substances that suck the calcium out of your bones. Stimulate the body to excrete more calcium than is being put into it. These substances are: alcohol/caffeine/salt/animal protein/fats/tobacco/distilled water/oxalic acid-rich foods (chard, rhubarb, spinach, and chocolate)/aluminum (absorbed from baking soda, aluminum pots, and from certain deodorants).\nPhosphorus-rich foods and drinks also impair calcium absorption, the worse offenders being soda drinks, milk and milk products, and many processed foods.\nAvoid the calcium vampire drugs.\nMany drugs disrupt calcium absorption or metabolism: antacids/antibiotics/anti-depressants/barbituates/cholesterol-reducing drugs/corticosteroids/diuretics/laxatives/chemotherapeutic drugs.\nSupport stomach acid.\nAn inadequate amount of stomach acid can lead to poor absorption of calcium. To increase stomach acid, eat charcoal-barbequed foods or charcoal supplements, eat more and slowly. Don\u2019t drink at your meals.\nGo outside. Vitamin D is important for calcium absorption. You can absorb vitamin D by being exposed to the sun. Get a healthy dose of this sun vitamin (1 hour or two), but don't overdo it.\nFish for fish oil.\nFish oil has a healthy dose of vitamin D which helps the body absorb calcium.\nDo the calcium-magnesium team.\nCalcium and magnesium are a team that work together in your body, so take calcium and magnesium on the same day. Pre-menopausal women should take approximately 1,000 mg. of calcium a day, and during menopause they should take about 1,500 mg. The best calcium supplements (in order of preference): hydroxyapatite/citrate/lactate/gluconate/carbonate. It is best to avoid taking large doses of calcium at one time; better to take smaller doses more frequently. Also, don't think that megadoses of calcium are better than the above recommendations; too much calcium can create problems because it displaces iron,\nmanganese, and zinc, and it can lead to kidney stones. The dose of magnesium should be at least 50% of the dose of calcium. For additional help, take 1,000 mg. of vitamin C, which helps to create\ncollagenous fibers to which the calcium of the bone is attached.\nSupplemental supplements.\nBoron, zinc, copper, and manganese are essential for bone integrity. They are all in green leafy vegetables. Boron is of special value; it has been found to stimulate higher estrogen levels and increase\nbone density. Supplementation of 5 mg. per day is recommended.\nCalcium-rich foods.\nSardines, salmon, green leafy vegetables, broccoli, tofu with calcium sulfate, mineral water, and sesame seeds all will supply your body with calcium. If you choose to get your calcium from\nmilk, yogurt, or cheese, it is recommended to consume low-fat or non-fat products because the body will be better able to assimilate their calcium.\nHorsetail tea.\nIt won't grow you a tail, but is rich in calcium and silica and can help build strong bones.\nBe born black.\nWhile this too is not a one-minute strategy, evidence does show that black people do not experience as much osteoporesis as white people, possibly because they have greater bone mass.\nNach einem durch Osteoporose verursachten Knochenbruch ist zu denken an Symphytum (anfangs D12, sp\u00e4ter C200 in seltenen Dosen) und zus\u00e4tzlich Calcium phosporicum D2 bis D4 3x/ Tag\nf\u00fcr die ersten 4-6 Wochen nach dem Knochenbruch.

Greenstone]\nBones are dense, highly active tissues comprised of special protein fibers called collagen that become mineralized primarily with calcium and phosphorus. Their surfaces are constantly being built up\nand broken down through the process of bone remodeling. Osteoclasts are bone cells that eat away old tired bone and pave the way for osteoblasts to lay down new healthy bone. Beyond that provided\nby simple material density, strength is added to bones through cross-bridging in their microscopic architecture.\nPeak bone mass reached in women age 30-35 and in men age 40-45. After this time, breakdown exceeds bone growth and build-up. Bone loss is a normal process takings place with aging and not a disease.\nOsteoporosis is characterized by weak, under-mineralized, and therefore frail bone that is at risk for spontaneous or fragility fracture (low impact). Even though postmenopausal women over age 60 have decreased bone density, only a small fraction of them actually experience fractures. A 50-year-old woman has a 15% chance of developing a hip fracture by the age of 85.\nMost of patients are surprised to hear how low the risk is, given the media hype about osteoporosis + bombardment of advertising for drugs that supposedly treat it. Osteoporosis is rare in men.\nThe most common tests for osteoporosis are DEXA or Bone Mineral Density (BMD) scans. These tests alone don't predict fracture rates or show true bone strength in the overwhelming majority of patients. Instead, they are predictive of fractures only in people who have already had fragility fractures, and who have low bone density test scores.\nThe tests are commonly conducted because administering them to large populations is relatively inexpensive. BMD is only one of many risk factors predicting fractures. Age, history of a previous fracture after age 40 and a maternal history of hip fracture are all independently more predictive than BMD.\nFurthermore, BMD measures only bone density, not bone strength. In a recent article in our premiere medical journal, The New England Journal of Medicine, experts studying osteoporosis showed that while, over time, a natural process of bone loss does take place, the strength of bone actually improves through increases in bone diameter. Changes in bone configuration and dynamics allow it to stay strong, accounting for relatively low hip fracture risks in the setting of low BMD.\nSome medications, particularly those in the bisphosphonate class, readily improve bone density within 2 years. Beyond 2 years, while bisphosphonates do not yield further BMD increases, they do poison the osteoclasts, allowing osteoblasts to lay down new bone on top of old, weak bone that would otherwise have been removed. Recent studies have suggested that even though there are slight decreases (1-5%) in fracture rates with bisphosphonates early on, after 5 - 6 years the fracture rates increase because the bone formed while on these medications is actually weaker.\nThe safety of many of these medications beyond five years is relatively unknown. Furthermore, the specific dynamics of the most commonly prescribed medication for bone loss causes it to stay in the body for many years. So if it turns out not to be safe, it will be difficult to purge such a medication from your system. If a person already has a fragility fracture and low BMD, it is not unreasonable for a doctor to prescribe bisphosphonates - but taking them longer than two years is not wise.\nThere are many natural approaches to preventing bone loss, increasing bone strength, and decreasing fracture rates, falls and complications from osteoporosis. Diet plays an important role. Our bodies function best in a slightly alkaline environment, with a blood pH (a measure of acid and base balance) of 7.4. Our enzymes and internal cellular activities function best in this environment. The majority of foods we ingest, however, are acidic. Along with our kidneys, our bones provide a means of buffering the acid foods and keeping the blood in the basic pH range. To perform this buffering process, our bones lose calcium and therefore density. Furthermore, diets high in animal protein are quite acidic and cause calcium to be leeched from our bones.\nOur diets may also be somewhat deficient in appropriate mineralizing substances found in plants, in particular root-based and green, leafy vegetables.\nNutrition for Bone Health\n10 mg of Vit D and 1.000 mg of Ca?, 500 mg Mg daily.\nSources of Calcium\nParsley, seaweed, broccoli, Sesame seeds, almonds, figs, green leafy veggies, yogurt, molasses, dried beans, Brazil nuts, watercress, sardines, celery, turnips, cabbage, garbanzo beans, kelp\nSources of Vitamin D essential for the body to be able to use calcium\nsunlight\noily fish-cod liver, salmon, sardines, herring, mackerel, tuna, egg yolks\nSources of Vitamin C necessary for the production of collagen\ncitrus fruits\nrose hips\nacerola cherries\nguava, papaya, grapefruit, lemons, tomatoes, cantaloupe, strawberries, kiwi, broccoli, green peppers, kale, cauliflower\nSources of Magnesium Magnesium can decline with a diet high in salt.\nfigs, sunflower seeds, black beans, kelp, molasses, whole grains\n\u2022 Coffee, alcohol, refined bran (phytic acid) and smoking all lead to low calcium in the bones, a high salt-red meat diet increases calcium excretion.\n\u2022 Medications may decrease the absorption of calcium, vitamin C and vitamin D.\n\u2022 Antacids containing aluminum, and anticoagulants may reduce calcium absorption.\n\u2022 Vitamin C effectiveness may be reduced by nicotine, sulpha drugs, mineral oils, tetracycline antibiotics and birth control pills.\nThe process of bone remodeling goes on constantly. Weight-bearing exercises are the best way to stress the bones and stimulate the osteoblast/ osteoclast activity that lays down new, healthy, strong bone.\nWeight-bearing activities such as:\nwalking \u2022 jogging \u2022 yoga?\neurythmy \u2022 special dynamics\nweight lifting\nstrengthen the bones\nWeight-bearing exercise also strengthens the\nsupportive muscles that help us with coordination and with maintaining the\nstrength and balance needed to prevent the frailty and falls that lead to\nosteoporosis-related fractures and their often debilitating complications.\nWeight-bearing activities have been proven to be more effective than\nmedications at reducing fracture rates and falls. 7\nWeight-bearing exercise also strengthens the supportive muscles that help us with coordination and with maintaining the strength and balance needed to prevent the frailty and falls that lead to osteoporosis-related fractures and their often debilitating complications. Weight-bearing activities have been proven to be more effective than medications at reducing fracture rates and falls. 7\nOther natural therapies include anthroposophical remedies, such as Calcon AM and PM, which promote healthy bone formation, calcium absorption and appropriate delivery of the calcium to bone. Appropriate calcium delivery also minimizes calcium entrance to other structures, such as our coronary arteries, where it is unwanted. The fatty sclerotic/hardening process of atherosclerosis is partly driven by inappropriate calcium deposition. Remember, heart disease is the no. 1 killer of postmenopausal women.\nHormone replacement therapy medications have been commonly recommended for treating osteoporosis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, however, actually pulled its recommendation and approval for the use of hormone replacement therapy in the treatment of osteoporosis in 2001. The reason: increasing evidence that the slight benefit in lowered fracture rates is significantly offset by heightened risks of developing stroke, heart attack and leg blood clots. These blood clots often migrate to the lungs with dire consequences.\nIt is imperative that everyone, but especially young women, become informed about these bone health issues so that they may be encouraged to take up weight-bearing exercise, and increase their consumption of whole foods and the higher plant protein-rich diets. These practices can help prevent osteoporosis, frailty and osteoporosis-related complications. We also need to support older women with their greater osteoporosis risk through similar appropriate recommendations, plus other natural approaches that support bone health and bone strength.\nFinally, we must not allow ourselves to be misled by recommendations for BMD measurements before age 60 or 65. They are designed to push us towards medications that show only minimal benefit, while adding significant risks and cost. It should be pointed out, also, that there are other medications and specific medical conditions that can adversely affect bone health. Ask a health care provider familiar with your health status for relevant individualized information.\n\u2021 Folgendes hat anthroposofische Einschl\u00fc\u00dfe \u2021\n[Philip Incao, M.D.]\nA lot of misleading advertising today reminds us, especially women, to be sure to take enough calcium to avoid osteoporosis. Therefore most Americans mistakenly believe that the reason our bones get thinner (osteoporosis) and we become more prone to fractures as we get older, is because we're not getting enough calcium in our diet. This popular misconception is good for the dairy and supplement industries but it doesn't help the rest of us very much. Here's why: Bones are not the solid inert chunks of calcium that we imagine.\nBones are living dynamic organs of our body that are continually being remodeled; that is, they are continually dissolved and rebuilt by specialized bone-dissolving and bone-building cells within\nus. All of our bones completely renew themselves every seven to ten years. Bone loss that can lead to osteoporosis happens when, for a variety of known and unknown reasons, the activity of the bone-dissolving cells predominates over that of the bonebudding cells.\nOur bones consist of a living matrix or network of protein fibers which create the framework upon which mineral crystals of calcium phosphate salts are laid down. The protein fibers are alive and gristly and make the bone flexible while the mineral calcium salts are dead and make the bone hard, dense and heavy.\nBone density measurements, which essentially measure bone calcium, confirm that after about the age of 50 it is normal for a person to lose bone density over time. Loss of bone density that is slightly greater than normal for ones age is called osteopenia. Moderately greater than normal loss of bone density is called osteoporosis.\nResearch done in\na doubling of the risk, while \"other factors\" accounted for the rest of this thirteen-fold increased risk of hip fracture in these Rotterdam citizens. These other factors had nothing to do with loss of calcium or bone density but rather with the loss of flexibility and elasticity of the bones which normally occurs as we age.\nWhat makes our bones elastic and flexible? The living part of our bones, the protein fiber matrix. As we age, this tight and dense framework or matrix of protein fibers becomes thinner and looser because the individual fibers lose their elasticity and become drier and stiffer (the same is true for all the tissues of our body). This makes our bones more brittle and prone to fractures, and slower to heal when they do fracture.\nTherefore, to avoid fractures and to have vigorous, quick-healing bones we must learn how to maintain our life forces, for these are the forces which maintain the tightness and the resilience of the living protein fibers which are deposited within that protein fiber framework. Osteoporosis is not just the loss of bone mineral mass (calcium crystals) but also the fraying of the intimate fabric of living protein fibers which forms the very basis of our bones. One can demonstrate this non-calcium protein fabric of bone by immersing a chicken bone in a bottle of white vinegar for several days until all the calcium is dissolved away. What remains still has the same shape and form of the bone but it is entirely elastic, as if made of rubber! Rubber is, after all, also derived from a living substance. It is made by the rubber tree.\nSo we see that our miraculous human organism combines living and pliant protein fibers with hard crystalline calcium from the non-living mineral world to create our sturdy and resilient bones, and then our organism continually remodels them and heals them when they are injured. These life forces of growth, remodeling and healing in us which R.S. called etheric forces or simply the etheric (called chi or prana in eastern wisdom) are responsible for the vigor and resilience of our bones and of all our other organs and tissues as well.\nAfter mid-life our vital etheric forces gradually decline. This is the fundamental reason why our bones lose both elasticity and density then. What makes us vulnerable to fractures is primarily the loss of the living elasticity of the protein fiber bone matrix. The loss of non-living calcium density from our bones is only a secondary cause. Both losses are caused by the gradual withdrawal of our etheric life forces from our bones with aging. However, it is only when the life forces withdraw at a faster than average rate for our age that osteoporosis and an abnormally high risk of fractures comes about. Modern medicine has no name for, and no way of measuring, the loss of elasticity of the protein fiber framework of our bones. Nevertheless, the integrity and flexibility of this living framework are the most important factors protecting us from fractures.\nModern medical research however has identified a number of lifestyle, nutritional and hormonal factors which have been repeatedly observed to accelerate the bone deterioration we call osteoporosis. These factors are quite diverse, ranging from physical immobility to lack of sunlight to poor diet to caffeine intake to hormonal imbalance to excessive protein intake to tobacco use to alcohol overindulgence to overly vigorous exercise!\nWhat we can say with certainty from the perspective of anthroposophic medicine is that all of these known factors which accelerate osteoporosis are factors which diminish or deplete the vital work of our body's etheric life forces.\nWe will discuss these factors in detail in The Doctor Speaks in the next issue, but for now in order to promote bone healing, I recommend the following; Eat fresh whole foods with lots of leafy greens and root vegetables like carrots, beets and turnips, in addition to your normal diet.\n\u2022 Do aerobic exercise at least 4x weekly to promote better circulation to your feet and bones.\n\u2022 Try to avoid all caffeine, soft drinks, alcohol and tobacco.\n\u2022 Take 1/2 tsp. of a tested, certified pure cod liver oil every morning, to provide vitamin D.\n\u2022 Take calcium citrate providing 600mg to 1200 mg per day of elemental calcium.\n\u2022 Take a multivitamin/mineral pill daily\n\u2022 Take a total of 400 to 800 mg daily of magnesium and 3 to 5mg daily of boron (as sodium tetraborate).\nIn my last column on bone health I emphasized a broader view: that the elasticity and flexibility of the living protein fiber framework of a bone is much more important than its calcium content in protecting our bones from fractures. DEXA bone mineral density scans are commonly prescribed by doctors to assess one's risk of fractures and to diagnose a mild (osteopenia) or moderate (osteoporosis) low-calcium status of one's bones. However, in an excellent article on bone health in the winter 2003 issue of LILIPOH, Clinton Greenstone, M.D. stated, \"Actually, these [bone density] tests alone don't predict fracture rates or show true bone strength in the overwhelming majority of patients.\" Dr. Greenstone further explained that bisphosphonate drugs like Fosamax cause slight increases in bone density and a slight lowering of the fracture rate only for about two years and that \"after five or six years the fracture rates increase because the bone formed while on these medications is actually weaker.\"\nIn the narrow focus on calcium that dominates most media stories on bone health today, we are seldom told that the first step in building strong, resilient bone is the laying down of a dense, elastic and well-structured living protein fiber framework, or bone matrix. The second step is the attachment of calcium phosphate mineral crystals to the protein fiber framework, i.e. the protein fibers become calcified. A tightly woven protein fiber matrix will attract more calcium to a developing bone and result in a stronger and denser bone than the bone formed from a loosely woven protein fiber matrix. This explains why osteoporosis never results from calcium deficiency alone but rather from those factors which hinder the formation of a tightly woven protein fiber matrix as our bones continually remodel themselves throughout our lives. In the last LILIPOH I said that the wise forces of life, growth and remodeling in us are responsible for the strength and resilience of our bones, skin, connective tissue and all the organs and tissues of our body. These wise forces of life, or etheric forces, are our inner highly skilled construction crew which builds the protein fiber matrix of our bones and everything else in our body. Yet, these forces need the direction of our \"inner architect\u201d to maintain our bones and our body in good health throughout life.\nJust as an architect knows the materials needed for a building as well as the plans, our inner architect knows exactly how much and what kind of foods are needed to maintain strong bones and tissues. This inner architect is our inner instinctive sense that humans and animals are born with, a \u201clife sense: that guides our food choices as our needs change throughout life. Animals in the wild have a keen instinctual life sense which unerringly guides them to eat what they need to maintain health lifelong. We humans lose this function of our life sense after early childhood, so that, except during pregnancy or illness or other special circumstances, we are left with only our habitual likes and dislikes to guide our food choices.\nOsteoporosis and many other chronic conditions prevalent in developed nations owe their existence to the sad fact that for most of us, our likes and dislikes in food and lifestyle have little or nothing to do with what our bodies need to maintain good health. This keeps doctors busy. The good news however, is that we can educate our life sense to begin wanting the foods that we actually need, if we're willing to make the effort.\nI find that many of my patients don't eat enough vegetables, fruits or whole grains. Modern research confirms that vegetables, leafy greens, and whole grains like oats, rye and brown rice, are rich in the forces and nutrients needed by our inner construction crew, our etheric life forces, to build a strong protein fiber bone matrix and to calcify it into a sturdy yet flexible bone.\nPerhaps surprisingly, countries with the highest dairy intake have the highest hip fractures rates. In the Nurse's Health Study in 1980 of 761 women aged 34 through 59-years-old who had never used calcium supplements, the women who drank two or more glasses of milk per day had a 45% increased risk of hip fracture compared to women consuming one glass or less per week.\nMany of the causes of osteoporosis mentioned in my last column, such as tobacco use and excessive intake of protein, (including dairy), caffeine, alcohol, sugar, processed foods and soft drinks have in common an acid-forming effect in the body. An acidic inner environment is also created by stress, nervousness, exhaustion, excessive exercise and by an overactive thyroid gland.\nAll of these factors increase the tendency to osteoporosis by depleting our vital etheric forces. When our life forces are strong and our stress is low, our inner environment becomes alkaline and we slow down and relax and become more cow-like in our behavior. When the hectic pace of life depletes our etheric forces, then our inner condition is acid and, if we have not yet reached the stage of exhaustion, we are tense, nervous, irritable, and generally bird-like in our behavior. Many of our modern illnesses, including osteoporosis, stem from dietary and lifestyle influences that speed us up, make us inwardly acid and brittle and deplete our etheric vitality.\nIn the natural world, cows are the epitome of strong etheric\nlife forces; that's why they are considered holy in\nQ. I am 55 years old, and I broke some of the bones in my foot over 3 months ago. A recent x-ray shows that the bones are not healing very quickly. Can you help me understand why this is?\nA. Your question leads us into the larger question of how we can maintain healthy bones and avoid the osteoporosis and bone fractures which are increasingly likely as we age. I believe that the factors which have retarded the healing of your foot fractures are very likely the same factors which, research has found, increase the occurrence of osteoporosis and fractures in the average person.\nA lot of misleading advertising today reminds us, especially women, to be sure to take enough calcium to avoid osteoporosis. Therefore most Americans mistakenly believe that the reason our bones get thinner (osteoporosis) and we become more prone to fractures as we get older, is because we're not getting enough calcium in our diet.

Loss of bone density that is slightly greater than normal for ones age is called osteopenia. Moderately greater than normal loss of bone density is called osteoporosis.\nResearch done in Holland in 1997 showed that from age 60 to 80 the risk of hip fracture increased thirteen-fold among men as well as women. The surprising finding was that loss of bone density (bone calcium) accounted for only a doubling of the risk, while \"other factors\" accounted for the rest of this thirteen-fold increased risk of hip fracture in these Rotterdam citizens. These other factors had nothing to do with loss of calcium or bone density but rather with the loss of flexibility and elasticity of the bones which normally occurs as we age.\nWhat makes our bones elastic and flexible?

Nevertheless, the integrity and flexibility of this living framework are the most important factors protecting us from fractures.\nModern medical research however has identified a number of lifestyle, nutritional and hormonal factors which have been repeatedly observed to accelerate the bone deterioration we call osteoporosis. These factors are quite diverse, ranging from physical immobility to lack of sunlight to poor diet to caffeine intake to hormonal imbalance to excessive protein intake to tobacco use to alcohol overindulgence to overly vigorous exercise!\nWhat we can say with certainty from the perspective of anthroposophic medicine is that all of these known factors which accelerate osteoporosis are factors which diminish or deplete the vital work of our body's etheric life forces.\nWe will discuss these factors in detail in The Doctor Speaks in the next issue, but for now in order to promote bone healing, I recommend the following; Eat fresh whole foods with lots of leafy greens and root vegetables like carrots, beets and turnips, in addition to your normal diet.\n\u2022 Do aerobic exercise at least four times weekly to promote better circulation to your feet and bones.\n\u2022 Try to avoid all caffeine, soft drinks, alcohol and tobacco.\n\u2022 Take \u00bd tsp. of a tested, certified pure cod liver oil every morning (vitamin D).\n\u2022 Take calcium citrate providing 600mg to 1200 mg per day of elemental calcium.\n\u2022 Take a multivitamin/mineral pill daily\n\u2022 Take a total of 400 to 800 mg daily of magnesium and 3 to 5mg daily of boron (as sodium tetraborate).\nIn my last column on bone health I emphasized a broader view: that the elasticity and flexibility of the living protein fiber framework of a bone is much more important than its calcium content in protecting our bones from fractures. DEXA bone mineral density scans are commonly prescribed by doctors to assess one's risk of fractures and to diagnose a mild (osteopenia) or moderate (osteoporosis) low-calcium status of one's bones. However, in an excellent article on bone health in the winter 2003 issue of LILIPOH, Clinton Greenstone, M.D. stated, \"Actually, these [bone density] tests alone don't predict fracture rates or show true bone strength in the overwhelming majority of patients.\" Dr. Greenstone further explained that bisphosphonate drugs like Fosamax cause slight increases in bone density and a slight lowering of the fracture rate only for about two years and that \"after five or six years the fracture rates increase because the bone formed while on these medications is actually weaker.\"\nIn the narrow focus on calcium that dominates most media stories on bone health today, we are seldom told that the first step in building strong, resilient bone is the laying down of a dense, elastic and well-structured living protein fiber framework, or bone matrix. The second step is the attachment of calcium phosphate mineral crystals to the protein fiber framework, i.e. the protein fibers become calcified. A tightly woven protein fiber matrix will attract more calcium to a developing bone and result in a stronger and denser bone than the bone formed from a loosely woven protein fiber matrix. This explains why osteoporosis never results from calcium deficiency alone but rather from those factors which hinder the formation of a tightly woven protein fiber matrix as our bones continually remodel themselves throughout our lives. In the last LILIPOH I said that the wise forces of life, growth and remodeling in us are responsible for the strength and resilience of our bones, skin, connective tissue and all the organs and tissues of our body. These wise forces of life, or etheric forces, are our inner highly skilled construction crew which builds the protein fiber matrix of our bones and everything else in our body. Yet, these forces need the direction of our \"inner architect\u201d to maintain our bones and our body in good health throughout life. Just as an architect knows the materials needed for a building as well as the plans, our inner architect knows exactly how much and what kind of foods are needed to maintain strong bones and tissues. This inner architect is our inner instinctive sense that humans and animals are born with, a \u201clife sense: that guides our food choices as our needs change throughout life. Animals in the wild have a keen instinctual life sense which unerringly guides them to eat what they need to maintain health lifelong. We humans lose this function of our life sense after early childhood, so that, except during pregnancy or illness or other special circumstances, we are left with only our habitual likes and dislikes to guide our food choices.\nOsteoporosis and many other chronic conditions prevalent in developed nations owe their existence to the sad fact that for most of us, our likes and dislikes in food and lifestyle have little or nothing to do with what our bodies need to maintain good health. This keeps doctors busy. The good news however, is that we can educate our life sense to begin wanting the foods that we actually need, if we're willing to make the effort.\nI find that many of my patients don't eat enough vegetables, fruits or whole grains. Modern research confirms that vegetables, leafy greens, and whole grains like oats, rye and brown rice, are rich in the forces and nutrients needed by our inner construction crew, our etheric life forces, to build a strong protein fiber bone matrix and to calcify it into a sturdy yet flexible bone.\nPerhaps surprisingly, countries with the highest dairy intake have the highest hip fractures rates. In the Nurse's Health Study in 1980 of 761 women aged 34 through 59-years-old who had never used calcium supplements, the women who drank two or more glasses of milk per day had a 45 percent increased risk of hip fracture compared to women consuming one glass or less per week.\nMany of the causes of osteoporosis mentioned in my last column, such as tobacco use and excessive intake of protein, (including dairy), caffeine, alcohol, sugar, processed foods and soft drinks have in common an acid-forming effect in the body. An acidic inner environment is also created by stress, nervousness, exhaustion, excessive exercise and by an overactive thyroid gland. All of these factors increase the tendency to osteoporosis by depleting our vital etheric forces. When our life forces are strong and our stress is low, our inner environment becomes alkaline and we slow down and relax and become more cow-like in our behavior. When the hectic pace of life depletes our etheric forces, then our inner condition is acid and, if we have not yet reached the stage of exhaustion, we are tense, nervous, irritable, and generally bird-like in our behavior. Many of our modern illnesses, including osteoporosis, stem from dietary and lifestyle influences that speed us up, make us inwardly acid and brittle and deplete our etheric vitality.\nIn the natural world, cows are the epitome of strong etheric life forces; that's why they are considered holy in India. Birds are the epitome of strong nerve forces, (which deplete life forces), and which give birds their typical nervous, hyperactive behavior. With their low life forces, birds easily die after shock or injury, not so with cows.\nThe modern epidemic of osteoporosis is linked to our prevailing high-stress, accelerated, bird-like lifestyle. So the bottom line is: to have strong bones, be bovine, not aquiline!\nZEIT ONLINE\nGesundheit\nStimmt's? Knochenbruch\n\"Sind Knochen nach einem Bruch st\u00e4rker als vorher?\"\u2026fragt Christoph Bathelt aus Mainz.\nWir stellen uns die Knochen unseres K\u00f6rpers ja oft als starres, totes Material vor. Aber das sind sie mitnichten \u2013 im Knochen findet ein st\u00e4ndiger Auf- und Abbau von Zellen statt.\nZwar verl\u00e4uft dieser Prozess mit zunehmendem Alter langsamer, aber selbst bei einem sehr alten Menschen bestehen die Knochen aus Material, das nicht \u00e4lter als 20 Jahre ist. Und so ist auch die St\u00e4rke der Knochen variabel:\nEin Knochen, den man stark belastet, wird st\u00e4rker, und ein unbelasteter Knochen bildet sich zur\u00fcck \u2013 deshalb leiden Astronauten in der Schwerelosigkeit des Weltalls nicht nur unter Muskel-, sondern auch unter Knochenschwund.\nAu\u00dferdem werden die Knochen von vielen Blutgef\u00e4\u00dfen durchzogen. Bricht ein Knochen unter Belastung, dann entsteht an der Bruchstelle zun\u00e4chst ein gro\u00dfer Bluterguss. Dieses H\u00e4matom ist das Signal f\u00fcr den K\u00f6rper, mit der Reparaturarbeit zu beginnen. An der Stelle der Fraktur bauen die sogenannten Osteoblasten (so hei\u00dfen die Zellen, die f\u00fcr die Knochenbildung zust\u00e4ndig sind) neues Material auf.\nW\u00e4hrend man zum Beispiel den gebrochenen Arm im Gips tr\u00e4gt, wird der Knochen an der Stelle des Bruchs zun\u00e4chst einmal dicker als vorher, w\u00e4hrend das alte Knochenmaterial rechts und links davon aufgrund mangelnder Belastung eher schw\u00e4cher wird. In dieser Reparaturphase k\u00f6nnte man also tats\u00e4chlich behaupten, dass der Knochen an der Bruchstelle st\u00e4rker ist.\nDabei bleibt es aber nicht. Denn Zellen einer anderen Sorte, die sogenannten Osteoklasten, bauen \u00fcbersch\u00fcssiges Material wieder ab. Sie bedienen sich dazu einer starken S\u00e4ure. Das Resultat ihrer Feinarbeit ist ein v\u00f6llig intakter Knochen, dessen Bruchgeschichte hinterher nur noch ein Fachmann zu erkennen vermag. Die Stelle der Fraktur ist dann nicht schw\u00e4cher \u2013 sie ist aber auch nicht st\u00e4rker als vor dem Unfall.\n[Rosina Sonnenschmidt]\nUrsache: Hypophysen-Insuffizienz\nDysfunktionen:\n\u2022 Hypophysen-Insuffizienz\nCorticotropinmangel\n\u2022 Gonaden-Insuffizienz\n\u00d6strogenmangel\n\u2022 Nebenschilddr\u00fcsen-Insuffizienz\nKnochenschw\u00e4che\n\u2022 RES-Insuffizienz\nSchw\u00e4chung der Knochen-, Knorpel- und Muskelsubstanz\nTherapievorschlag in 4 Tagen Rhytmus:\nNr. 12 Hypophyse-Komplexmittel\nNr. 11 Corticotrop-Komplexmittel\nNr. l Gonadotrop-Komplexmittel\nNr. 10 Immunotrop-Komplexmittel\n[Markus Sommer]\nMarkus Sommer, M.D.\nEarly in December 1996, Mrs A. M., retired farmer's wife, came to see me because of severe pain in the left hip. She said it had been so bad for the last 3 years\nthat the orthopedic surgeon had to give her injections all the time. She was on continuous anti-inflammatory medication but the pain was so severe that walking was difficult. It was \"like toothache\". According to her, the orthopedic surgeon said it came \"from a disk\".\nThe patient was only able to walk with difficulty, limping and using a stick. Examination showed no paresis or abnormalities of sensation indicative of radicular syndrome. Individual muscle reflexes equal and medium active bilaterally, Lasegue's sign negative. Pelvis at a slight angle, moderate convex scoliosis to the left in the lower thoracic spine, lordosis and a marked rotation and abduction deficit in the left hip joint. X-ray showed moderate degenerative changes in the right hip joint and almost complete loss of articular cartilage, with some erosion of bone on the left, together with considerable sclerosis and cysts. These major changes are clearly in evidence in the X-ray pictures shown below.\nIn view of the seriousness of the changes and the long period of previous treatment, which had shown little success, I strongly advised hip replacement surgery. The patient refused this. Without too much hope of seeing improvement I suggested the following treatment.\n5 pilules of Cartilago/Mandragora comp.wa) 3 times daily; 1 ampule of Articulatio coxae Gl 6x (Wala) by mouth twice a week, and a good pinch of Stannum met. 6x trit. (Weleda) at night.\nMandragora (5x), a member of the deadly nightshade family with a tremendous root, similar to Bryonia, was given above all to reduce the inflammatory activation of the chronic arthritis. Its analgesic actions were known in ancient Egypt, for a painting found in the tomb of Tutankhamen shows the ruler with his diseased hip supporting himself with a stick in the garden, his wife handing him a mandrake root.\nLike tin, silver (8x) has a relationship to cartilage, a water-based tissue, but shows greater efficacy in counteracting excessive decay due to inflammatory processes. Antimony (6x) also has a structuring effect in the treatment of inflammatory conditions that threaten further destruction where degenerative changes have caused the original damage. Betulae e fol. (5x) finally stimulates the internal kidney process to encourage elimination of metabolic products in the periarticular region, products mainly due to inadequate protein degradation.\nThe above substances will primarily counteract the painful inflammatory reaction which, however, should only be seen as a secondary effect of the disease.\nThe other two medicaments address a deeper level. Stannum is a substance relating to embrittlement as much as to fluidity and plasticity. The alpha modification of tin which develops at low temperatures (tin pest) is a powder showing none of the properties of a metal. Tin also goes through a brittle phase before it melts if heated, which actually makes it possible to triturate the metal in a mortar. The fluid state which follows is wide-ranging, however, for the metal has both a remarkably low melting point (232\u00b0 C) and a high boiling point (2602\u00b0 C). This gives us an idea of the universal effect tin may have on cartilage, a tissue which is between the solid and fluid states of aggregation. Probably the earliest and most widely metal to be used in alloys, it changes the properties of its metal partners\nto a remarkable degree. Adding just 3% of tin to copper will appreciably increase resistance to wear, at the same time keeping the alloy ductile. 30 - 40% of added tin give a relatively brittle but highly lustrous alloy that was used for mirrors in antiquity. Between these two extremes, the bronze used for casting bells contains about 20% of tin, which makes it a solid metal with good resonance and only minimal deadening of sound. These positive tin qualities can often be utilized by giving low potencies in the treatment of arthritis. Giving a low potency of the organ preparation, in this case Articulatio coxae, has frequently proved most valuable in vitalizing the etheric, stimulating regeneration or at least delaying the degenerative process.\nAlthough this treatment regimen had given good results in my experience, Mrs M's condition was so severe that I had little hope of any improvement. I therefore was not looking forward to her next appointment 3 months later. But to my surprise I was told by the patient that the pain had improved greatly within 3 weeks and she was now practically symptom free. She said she had not needed any further injections and had also discontinued the NSAID. She was able to sleep without pain, turn over during the night without waking, and also to walk without pain. Objectively, there was little change, but there can be no doubt that the patient's life saw a great change with the treatment. Her decision not to have a hip replacement had obviously been right. The case also shows that even pathological changes resulting in severe physical deformation can be made to \"swing back\" to some degree if treatment is given to address the etheric.\n[Michael Filzinger]\nS\u00e4ure-Basen-Gleichgewicht\nEntdecker der S\u00e4ure-Basen-Theorie:\nDer schwedische Chemiker Prof. Dr. Ragnar Berg (1873 - 1956) stellte in einer Ver\u00f6ffentlichung 1912 fest, dass der menschliche K\u00f6rper Basen und S\u00e4uren in einem Verh\u00e4ltnis 80 : 20 herzustellen sucht. Krankheiten basieren h\u00e4ufig auf einem Missverh\u00e4ltnis, n\u00e4hmlich der \u00dcbers\u00e4urung des K\u00f6rpers. Um gesund zu bleiben muss die Ern\u00e4hrung ebenfalls das Verh\u00e4ltnis von 80 : 20 ber\u00fccksichtigen. Wichtig ist hierbei: Es kommt nicht darauf an, wie sauer oder basisch ein Lebensmittel ansich ist (z.B. Zitrone ist sauer), sondern wie es sich im Organismus auswirkt (z.B. Zitrone wirkt sehr basisch!).\nWas kann alles sauer sein?\nHier gebe ich jetzt die Kette der ganzen abh\u00e4ngigen S\u00e4ure-Kreisl\u00e4ufe an:\nK\u00f6rperzellen k\u00f6nnen im Inneren \u00fcbers\u00e4uern und dadurch die biologische Reaktionen f\u00fcr den K\u00f6rper ausser Kontrolle geraten. Die Zellen gleichen Ihre S\u00e4ure mit zellul\u00e4ren Zwischenr\u00e4umen aus.\nDie Zwischenr\u00e4ume der Zellen gleichen Ihre S\u00e4ure mit dem Blutkreislauf aus.\nWird das Blut zu sauer werden Puffer des K\u00f6rpers wie Knochen, Knorpel, Z\u00e4hne angezapft und dort Mineralien abgebaut (Osteoporose!).\nS\u00e4ure kann auch mit dem Urin (\u00fcber die Niere) abgebaut werden. Es gibt (unseri\u00f6se) Empfehlungen den PH-Wert des Urin zu messen und damit auf die \u00dcbers\u00e4urung des K\u00f6rpers zu schliessen. Wenn aber der Urin sauer ist, kann gerade der Blutkreislauf deswegen durchaus relativ basisch sein.\nS\u00e4ure wird \u00fcber das Atmen und die Lunge abgeben: CO2 - Kohlendioxid. Hier kann durch Sport etwas S\u00e4ure abgebaut werden.\nSauer wirkende Lebensmittel:\nSauer wirken grunds\u00e4tzlich alle Lebensmittel mit \u00fcberwiegend Eiweis und Kohlenhydrate. Dies sind im Wesentlichen Fleisch, Fisch und Produkte daraus. Durch den Abbau von Eiweiss wird im K\u00f6rper ein saures Milieu erzeugt.\nFr\u00fcher hat man Menschen in China damit hingerichtet, dass man ihnen nur noch Fleisch zu essen gab. Damit ist deren K\u00f6rper so \u00fcbers\u00e4uert, dass sie daran gestorben sind.\nNahrung aus im Wesentlichen Getreideprodukte und Zucker wirken nur sauer, da bei Ihrer Verstoffwechselung im K\u00f6rper viele Mineralstoffe ben\u00f6tigt werden und dies die Puffer aufbrauchen kann.\nFast alle gekochten, erhitzten, gebratenen, gebackenen Lebensmittel wirken nur noch sauer auf den K\u00f6rper.\nBasisch wirkende Lebensmittel:\nBasisch wirkend sind im Prinzip Obst, Gem\u00fcse, Fr\u00fcchte, selbst scheinbar \"saure\" Fr\u00fcchte wie Zitrone und Graipfruit. Dies gilt aber im Wesentlichen nur f\u00fcr Unerhitztes, also nicht gekochtes! Wenn Obst und Gem\u00fcse erhitzt wird, wirkt es nur noch sauer - ganz wenige Ausnahmen, wie z.B. die Kartoffel k\u00f6nnen auch noch gekocht basisch wirken.\nNoch nicht eindeutig zu bewertende Lebensmittel ...\nGetreide, Mehl, Zucker: Kohlenhydrate ben\u00f6tigen zur Verstoffwechselung im K\u00f6rper viele Mineralstoffe. Werden diese nicht zugef\u00fchrt, werden sie aus Puffern (z.B. Knochen) im K\u00f6rper abgebaut. Bei Vollkorngetreide ist nun der Mineralstoffanteil etwa viermal so hoch, wie im Mehl (Typ 405) aus dem Supermarkt. Ob dies schon ausreicht, dass das Vollkorngetreide basisch wirkt, mag ich nicht abschlie\u00dfen beurteilen. Ich denke erher nicht!\nEier, Tofu: Auch diese Lebensmittel enthalten \u00fcberwiegend Eiweis - auch f\u00fcr pflanzliches Eiweis gelten hier dieselben Argumente. Um das Eiweiss aus Lebensmitteln im K\u00f6rper zu verwerten, entstehen viele saure Produkte und der K\u00f6rper wird sauer (siehe Gicht!). Diese Lebensmittel enthalten nat\u00fcrlich auch Mineralstoffe, die aber nicht ausreichen eine insgesamt basische Wirkung zu erzielen.\nMilch und Milchprodukte: Milch und Milchprodukte enthalten meistens nicht unwesentlich Eiweis und lassen dieses im K\u00f6rper sauer abbauen. Auch, dass die Milch Mineralstoffe hat, wie z.B. das Calcium, \u00e4ndert nichts an der resultierenden sauren Wirkung von Milchprodukten. Durch die gleichzeitige Eiweisaufnahme mit dem Calcium, wird dessen Aufnahme vom K\u00f6rper weitgehend verhindert und Sie scheiden es mit dem Urin einfach wieder aus! Einzige Ausnahmen k\u00f6nnten Milchprodukte mit m\u00f6glichst wenig Eiweis sein, wie z.B. Butter oder Creme Fraiche. Aber welcher Konsument weiss schon wieviel Eiweis sein Milchprodukt noch enth\u00e4lt?\nWas tr\u00e4gt sonst noch zur \u00dcber\u00e4urung des K\u00f6rpers bei?\nViele Faktoren k\u00f6nnen zu einer \u00dcbers\u00e4urung des Organismus beitragen - einige nenne ich im Folgenden:\nEine zu saure Ern\u00e4hrung.\n\u00dcberforderung, Stress und Angstzust\u00e4nde - also auch psychische Faktoren.\nZu wenige Bewegung und Sport - kein Ausatmen der S\u00e4ure \u00fcber die Lungen.\nVerschiedene Medikamente.\nZu geringe Aufnahme von Mineralstoffen.\nZu geringe Aufnahme von Vitaminen.\nWenn nur ein gesunder Mensch t\u00e4glich Obst, Gem\u00fcse, Kartoffeln, und Vollkorn-Produkte konsumiert, so unterst\u00fctzt er einen ausgeglichenen S\u00e4ure-Basen-Haushalt in seinem K\u00f6rper auf zweierlei Weise: Erstens vermindert er durch Zufuhr von \"Zellwerkzeugen\", also Vitaminen, Spurenelementen, den intrazellul\u00e4ren Ausstoss zellul\u00e4rer S\u00e4uren, da die Enzymleistung optimal unterst\u00fctzt wird. Zweitens st\u00e4rkt er ... durch Zufuhr basischer Elektrolyte die Pufferkapazit\u00e4ten seines Organismus. (N\u00e4hrstoff-Akademie Salzburg)\n... kam Prof. Dr. med. Lothar Wendt zu dem Schluss, dass eine \u00fcberproportionale Zufuhr von Nahrungseiweis die Pufferkapazit\u00e4ten des Bindegewebes sukzessive reduziert. (N\u00e4hrstoff-Akademie Salzburg)\nDer \"S\u00e4ure-Basen-Haushalt\" wird aliment\u00e4r sehr wesentlich vom t\u00e4glichen Anteil an Proteinen, Kohlenhydraten, Fetten und Mikron\u00e4hrstoffen beeinflusst. (Schlussfolgerung von N\u00e4hrstoff-Akademie Salzburg)\nOsteoporose:\nDas menschliche Skelett (auch beim \u00dcbergewichtigen) wiegt etwa 7kg - davon sind etwa 1,5kg reines Calcium. Dies ist ein betr\u00e4chtliches Reservat eine \u00dcbers\u00e4urung des K\u00f6rpers zu puffern und verhindern. Nur nach vielen Jahren schlechter Lebensf\u00fchrung kann davon so viel aufgebraucht sein, dass die Knochen nicht mehr stabil genug sind und zu leicht brechen k\u00f6nnen. Wenn wir jeden Tag nur 5% Calcium zu wenig aufnehmen, w\u00e4re das in 40 Jahren die H\u00e4lfte des Calciums in unseren Knochen.\nF\u00fcr den Knochenaufbau sorgen 2 grunds\u00e4tzlich verschiedene Faktoren: einerseits die Hormone, welche den Knochenaufbau betreiben und andererseits gen\u00fcgend vorhandenes Calcium. Wenn nur eines von beidem gest\u00f6rt ist, kommt es zu Osteoporose! Wie es Frauen eingeredet wird, ist Osteoporose keine \u00d6strogenmangelkrankheit, sonst h\u00e4tten es ja alle M\u00e4nner. \u00d6strogen als Faktor, tr\u00e4gt nur etwas 5% zum Knochenaufbau bei - andere Faktoren sind wichtiger.\nViele Medikamente tragen zu \u00dcbers\u00e4urung des K\u00f6rpers oder auch direkt zum Knochenabbau bei:\nKortikoide als Antirheumamittel\nASS, Acetylsalicyls\u00e4ure, als Schmerzmittel\nWie basisch ist unser K\u00f6rper ?\nUnser Blut hat einen pH-Wert von 7,4 (grob: das Verh\u00e4ltnis von S\u00e4uren zu Basen). Eine Abweichugn von nur 0,5% erzeugt Sch\u00e4digungen im K\u00f6rper. Wenn der Wert nur 5-8% abweicht, ist das schon t\u00f6dlich! Bei Leistungssportlern kann in pH-Wert im Muskelgewebe auf pH 4 sinken - im Blut w\u00e4re das t\u00f6dlich. Insofern ist der K\u00f6rper gezwungen schon bei einer leichten \u00dcbers\u00e4urung durch Ern\u00e4hrung, Sport oder Lebensumst\u00e4nde dies sofort und schnell auszugleichen.\nIch habe eine f\u00fcr hier passende Leseranfrage in einer Zeitschrift gelesen:\n\"Kann man sich zu basisch ern\u00e4hren?\"\nDie Antwort war nat\u00fcrlich:\n\"... Nein beantworten. Eine Alkalose durch zu viel basische Lebensmittel ist praktisch nicht m\u00f6glich.\"\nSauer ern\u00e4hrt sich jeder in unserer Wohlstandsgesellschaft \"automatisch\". Darum sollten Sie sich so viel wie m\u00f6glich basisch ern\u00e4hren - ein zu viel gibt es da nicht!\n[Vorwort/Suchen](index.htm) [Zeichen/Abk\u00fcrzungen](legende.htm) [Impressum](index.htm)", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["osteoporose.htm", "index.htm", "legende.htm", "index.htm"]}
