It\u2019s not even that you want to come back. You need to come back. Cold is like that. You become hooked, like a junkie. And this is the only reasonable place to get your high (it takes too long to get to the others). So this year, I decided to take portraits of other addicts like me. Because for once, it got really cold.\nEvery sport has its hook and I guess for surfing, it\u2019s the simplicity and the water. You don\u2019t need a lot of equipment -- just your board and a bathing suit. And the water just washes away everything that\u2019s in your head. When you\u2019re in the water, you just forget about everything else.\nI started surfing and windsurfing when I was a teenager, in the southwest of France where I grew up. I discovered cold twenty years ago, when I met my wife. She is Finnish and comes from the \u2018big north.\u2019 So I discovered the \u2018big cold.\u2019 And just how addictive it can be. I would go walking on the frozen sea in the winter. The temperature would be around minus 15 Celsius and I would just get into a zone and before I knew it, I\u2019d be 10 kilometers from shore.\nCold is really therapeutic. You forget about absolutely everything. You just evacuate everything.\nSo I guess it was inevitable that eventually those two loves -- the surfing and the cold -- would come together. And Unstad, at Lofoten Islands above the Arctic Circle, was the perfect place to marry the two.\nI first heard about it when I read in a surf magazine that Tom Curren, the former Californian world champion in the 1980s, went surfing there. Intrigued, I made a mental note to check it out.\nIf you want to surf in cold weather, Unstad, high above the Arctic Circle in Norway, is basically the only spot in the world that\u2019s easily accessible. It takes me about six-seven hours to get there from Paris, where I am based -- a flight from Paris to Oslo, then a flight to Bado, then a flight in a smaller propeller plane to Leknes, which is 20 kilometers from Unstad.\nThere are other cold spots where you can surf of course -- Alaska, Kamchatka -- but they are very remote. It would take days to reach them.\nIt\u2019s my fourth year coming here. Usually, it\u2019s not that cold. The temperature outside is usually -5 Celsius -- chilly but certainly bearable. Because the Gulf Stream passes right by here, the temperature of the water is usually about 5 Celsius -- chilly, but with a good wetsuit on, tolerable.\nThis year, however, was different. That cold blast that gripped much of Europe in late February and early March? It reached all the way up here, too, so the temperatures dropped to minus 15C. Plus there was the wind. With the windchill, it felt like minus 25C. Now that\u2019s extreme surfing.\nJust how extreme? The car was about 50 meters away. By the time you walked from the water to the car, you could feel your wetsuit start to stiffen up and freeze. Then you had to take it off outside (because it\u2019s impossible to take a thick, stiff wetsuit off inside a car), put some dry clothes on, jump into the vehicle and crank up the heat. And then wait for your body to come back to life.\nBecause of the cold, your body uses more energy, so at the end of the day, you're spent. Much more tired than if you had been surfing in warm waters like Hawaii. You\u2019re exhausted, you\u2019re fed up, you just feel soft on the inside, you collapse into your bed. And yet in the morning, you\u2019re just ready to go again.\nWhy do it? Because once you\u2019re there, you just forget about absolutely everything. One hour in Unstad and I feel like I\u2019ve been on holidays for two weeks.\nMake no mistake -- compared to warm-water surfing, it\u2019s more suffering, it\u2019s more difficult, it\u2019s more preparation (instead of just a bathing suit, you have a thick wetsuit, booties, and, in my case when I shoot, fins to move fast in what is often a strong current). Your body suffers. You struggle against the cold. You get so tired. And yet there is so much pleasure in it. It\u2019s not masochism, not at all. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s really like a drug.\nIt\u2019s just such a huge pleasure. And of course the surroundings only add to the magic. Unstad is surrounded by mountains. So in addition to the physical challenge, you\u2019re surfing in just a mind-blowing beautiful place. It\u2019s not that busy -- this year, the busiest day was my last one there, with just 20-25 people in the water.\nThen of course, there are the Northern Lights. I mean, what can top that as part of the scenery? And there are the moments that you can only get in a remote place like this.\nFor example, one night, I was trying to take some night photos in the water. We were waiting for the Northern Lights and there was a fierce wind. Before putting on our wetsuits and going into the water, we made a fire on the beach, put some salmon with paprika and onions into foil and cooked it on the flames. It tasted soooo good. It wasn't just the quality of the fish, but the surroundings. The whole package. It's just one of those memories that'll stay with you.\nThe idea for the portraits came because I wanted to tell the story of surfing as a lifestyle. It\u2019s not just me who thinks this way, there are others as addicted to this place as I am. You don't have to live in Hawaii or California for surfing to be your life. It can be your life here, too.\n[The portraits](http://www.afpforum.com/AFPForum/Search/Results.aspx?pn=1&smd=4&mui=3&thi=3470653&lng=&fto=3&q=341564282543351781_0&dlg=en#pn=1&smd=4&mui=3&q=341564282543351781_0&thi=3470653&lng=&fto=3) turned out really nicely. It was probably one of the most natural assignments that I have shot. Everyone was enthusiastic and nice and very natural. And, like me, they all have their reasons for loving to surf in this special place.\nEllen Holgersen, 32, veterinarian: \u201cI prefer the cold water surf, that's why I moved here. I tried living in places where you can surf just outside your doorstep but it was like going to the gym for me, a lot of people and too simple. Here it's more of an expedition because of the cold.\u201d\nLisa Blom, 38, hotel manager: \u201cLofoten is like a big playground for grownups\u2026. Surfing is life. It's a must. It's the same for me as breathing, eating, sleeping, being with my family. There are quality waves here, they're consistent. When you're not surfing there are heaps of other things you can do -- hike, ski, kayak, stand-up paddle, fish... \u201d\nOle Kristian Fjelltun-Larsen, 34, coffee shop and B&B owner: \u201cWinter is more challenging, it\u2019s like an extreme form of meditation, with an extreme contact with nature.\u201d\nNils Nilsen, 26, an employee at a fishing factory: \u201cSurfing to me is peace of mind, quiet inside my head. One focus, that\u2019s it.\u201d\nUnstad is another planet, another world. It\u2019s just completely zen here. I think this very northern atmosphere makes it like that. You get the same vibe in Lapland.\nWhen you\u2019re out here, you\u2019re not the same anymore. You know you\u2019re way up north and there is less of everything -- people, tourists, hikers. But more of that special feeling that you get with the cold. I guess you can call it the Arctic spirit.\nThis blog was written with\n[Yana Dlugy](https://twitter.com/yanadlugy) in Paris.", "language": null, "image": "https://correspondent.afp.com/sites/default/files/styles/twitter_card/public/medias/aa_new_posts/countries/norway/arctic-surf-mar2018/norway-surf-cold-301.jpg?itok=dUssYKdX", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["#main-content", "/", "https://www.facebook.com/afpcorrespondent/", "https://twitter.com/AFP", "/rss.xml", "/olivier-morin", null, null, "http://www.afpforum.com/AFPForum/Search/Results.aspx?pn=1&smd=4&mui=3&thi=3470653&lng=&fto=3&q=341564282543351781_0&dlg=en#pn=1&smd=4&mui=3&q=341564282543351781_0&thi=3470653&lng=&fto=3", "https://twitter.com/yanadlugy", null, null, "/olivier-morin", "/olivier-morin", "https://twitter.com/afpolm", "https://www.instagram.com/olivier.morin/", "/olivier-morin", "/covering-cricket-highest-level", "/covering-cricket-highest-level", "/mermaid-ice", "/mermaid-ice", "/surfing-legend-swoops-above-arctic-circle", "/surfing-legend-swoops-above-arctic-circle", "/chills-and-charms-arctic-surfing", "/chills-and-charms-arctic-surfing", "/last-rhino-standing", "/nine-yellow-dots-barcelona", "https://focus.afp.com", "https://making-of.afp.com", "http://afp-photo.tumblr.com/", "/", "/about", "/contact", "https://www.facebook.com/afpcorrespondent/", "https://twitter.com/AFP", "/rss.xml"]}
