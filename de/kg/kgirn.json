In diesem Papier kommen wir zu dem Ergebnis, dass es zwar theoretisch \nw\u00fcnschenswert w \u00e4re, eine klare und universelle Definition der \u201egr\u00fcnen Wirtschaft\u201c zu haben, \ndass dies aber in der Praxis kaum wahrscheinlich ist. Stattdessen entwickelt sich aus den vielf \u00e4ltigen nationalen Initiativen die Grundz \u00fcge eines gemeinsamen Verst \u00e4ndnisses, was die \n\u201egr\u00fcne Wirtschaft\u201c ist . \nF\u00fcr einen solchen Ansatz spricht, dass in der Vergangenheit schon viele politische Begriffe \nbetr \u00e4chtlichen Einfluss hatten, ohne dass es eine exakte Definition gegeben h \u00e4tte \u2013 soziale \nGerechtigkeit oder Demokratie w \u00e4ren Beispiele hierf \u00fcr. In diesem Sinn liefert der Begriff der \ngr\u00fcnen Wirtschaft einen neuen Ansatz, um \u00fcber wirtschaftliche Entwicklung nachzudenken \u2013  \naber hierf \u00fcr bedarf es weniger einer genauen Definition, sondern eher eines \u00fcberzeugenden, in \nsich schl \u00fcssigen und motivierenden Argumentations musters.  \nEin solcher Ansatz birgt jedoch das Risiko dass, ohne genaue Definition, der Begriff als beli e-\nbig oder willk \u00fcrlich empfunden wird, und so letztlich wirkungslos wird. Eine M\u00f6glichkeit, dem \nentgegenzuwirken, ist, die wichtigsten Elemente eines Argumentationsmusters zu betonen. In \ndiesem Sinn fasst das vorliegende Papier zun \u00e4chst einige grundlegende Annahmen und B e-\nstandteile einer gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaft zusammen. Anhand von Beispielen aus verschiedenen \nL\u00e4ndern wird dann dargestellt, wie sich die gr\u00fc ne Wirtschaft auf andere Zielgr \u00f6\u00dfen wie B e-\nsch\u00e4ftigung, Armutsbek \u00e4mpfung oder Gesundheit auswirken k \u00f6nnte. Zudem werden einige \nwichtige Politikinstrumente diskutiert, die den Umbau zu einer gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaft voranbri n-\ngen k \u00f6nnen \u2013 darunter marktbasierte Instru mente, Investitions - und Innovationsf \u00f6rderung, \nBildung und Ausbildung, sowie ein neues Ma\u00df f\u00fcr wirtschaftliche Wohlfahrt.  \nAbstract  \nThe concept of a \u201dgreen economy\u201d has been around for a few years, but has gained in recogn i-\ntion and weight following the Rio+ 20 Conference in 2012, which recognised it as  \u201cone of the \nimportant tools available for achieving sustainable development\u201d. While the Conference did \nnot agree on a precise definition of the green economy concept, there is now an increasing body of experience from countries around the world that are implementing green economy initi a-\ntives, strategies or policies. These efforts are loosely coordinated by UNEP, which serves as an information hub to promote exchange on best practices. In this paper, we argue th at trying to \narrive at an exact and universal definition of the green economy might be useful in theory, but appears very unlikely in practice. Rather, what we see is a common understanding of the co n-\ncept that emerges from its concrete implementation in co untries around the world.  \nThis bottom -up approach recognises that, in the past, many concepts did not require a co m-\nmonly agreed or exact definition to have considerable impact \u2013  social justice or democracy \nwould come to mind. The concept of a green econom y provides a new model, i.e. a new way of \nthinking about economic development \u2013  and to serve this function, it is not so much an exact \ndefinition that is needed, but rather a consistent, convincing and compelling narrative.  \n 4 \n UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nThe risk of a bottom -up approach is that, without a precise definition, the concept may come to \nbe seen as arbitrary and meaningless. One way to contain this risk is to emphasise the core \nelements of such a narrative. Along this vein, this paper explores what the core elements and \nconst ituting features of the green economy could be. Drawing on examples from different \ncountries and regions, it discusses the expected benefits of a green economy for social and ec o-\nnomic development, including employment effects, poverty alleviation and healt h. It also looks \nat some of the main policies that can be expected to play a role in the policy mix for a green \neconomy \u2013 including pricing tools, new measures for economic welfare, investment support \nand training and education.  \n 5 \n UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \n  \n 6 \n UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nTable of Contents  \n1 Introduction: the concept of a green economy  ................................ ................................ ..... 9 \n1.1 Rio+20 and the challenge of defining a \u201cgreen economy\u201d  ................................ .............  22 \n1.2 Follow -up to Rio+20 and the role of the UN  ................................ ................................ .. 23 \n1.3 Constituting elements and essential featu res of a green economy  ................................ . 25 \n1.4 Different interpretations of the green economy concept  ................................ ................  27 \n2 Inclusive green economy: an engine for development?  ................................ ..........................  30 \n2.1 Opportunities for green and decent employment: job creation potential of a green \neconomy  ................................ ................................ ................................ ...................  30 \n2.2 Health benefits of a green economy  ................................ ................................ .............  33 \n2.3 The economic case for tackling environmental pressu res ................................ ..............  33 \n2.4 The link between environmental degradation and poverty  ................................ .............  34 \n2.5 Green economy to reduce the cost of resource imports and import dependency  ..............  35 \n2.6 Green economy as a driver of innovation ................................ ................................ ......  36 \n2.7 Trade effects of a green economy  ................................ ................................ ................  37 \n3 Policies for a green economy  ................................ ................................ ..............................  38 \n3.1 Getting the prices right  ................................ ................................ ...............................  39 \n3.1.1  Phasing out environmentally harmful subsidies  ................................ ......................  39 \n3.1.2  Introducing new market -based instruments for pricing externalities  .........................  41 \n3.1.3  Reflecting the value of nature  ................................ ................................ ................  42 \n3.2 Measure what matters \u2013 welfare indicators beyond GDP  ................................ ...............  43 \n3.3 Industrial policies and investment support for a green economy  ................................ .... 45 \n3.4 Training and education  ................................ ................................ ...............................  47 \n3.5 Managing the Transformation: Towards a Coherent Policy Mix  ................................ ......  48 \n4 Conclusions  ................................ ................................ ................................ .......................  50 \n5 References  ................................ ................................ ................................ ........................  52 \n \nList of Figures  \nFigure 1:  Innovation in climate change mitigation technologies, compared to all \nsectors  ................................ ................................ ................................ ...........  36 \n 7 \n UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nList of Abbreviations  \nBAU Business As Usual  \nCCS  Carbon Capture and Storage  \nCO 2 Carbon dioxide  \nEU European Union  \nGDP  Gross Domestic Product  \nGE Green Economy  \nGGGI  Global Green Growth Initiative  \nIEA International Energy Agency  \nIILS International Institute for Labour Studies  \nILO International Labour Organisation  \nIMF International Monetary Fund  \nOECD  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  \nPAGE  Partnership for Action on Green Economy  \nppm  parts per million  \nREDD  Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and (Forest) Degradation  \nTEEB  The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity  \nUN United Nations  \nUNEP  United Nations Environment Programme  \nUNESCAP  United Nations Economic and Social Commission for the Asia Pacific  \nUS$  United States dollars  \nVAT Value Added Tax  \n \n  \n 8 \n UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \n1 Zusammenfassung  \nGr\u00fcne Wirtschaft: Versuch einer Begriffskl\u00e4rung  \nDer Begriff der \u201cgr \u00fcnen Wirtschaft\u201d (green economy) wird schon seit einigen Jahren verwen-\ndet, hat jedoch durch die Rio+20 -Konferenz 2012 eine deutliche Aufwertung erfahren. Die \nKonferenz sah darin \u201ceines der wichtigen Mittel zur Herbeif \u00fchrung  einer nachhaltigen En t-\nwicklung \u201d, um die Bed \u00fcrfnisse einer wachsenden Weltbev \u00f6lkerung zu befriedigen, ohne die \nbegrenzte Tragf \u00e4higkeit der globalen  \u00d6kosysteme dauerhaft zu \u00fcberschreiten. W \u00e4hrend die \nRio+20 -Konferenz die Bedeutung des Begriffs der gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaft unterstrich, findet sich \njedoch im Abschlussdokument der Konferenz keine genaue Definition des Begriffs . Das Do-\nkument beschreibt vielmehr, was die gr \u00fcne Wirtschaft leisten soll: es soll zur Armuts bek\u00e4mp-\nfung und zu stabilem wirtschaftlichen Wachstum beitragen, soziale Inklusion bef \u00f6rdern, \nmenschliches Wohlergehen verbessern, M \u00f6glichkeiten f \u00fcr Besch \u00e4ftigung und w \u00fcrdige Arbeit s-\nverh \u00e4ltnisse schaffen, und gleichzeitig die Funktionsf \u00e4higkeit der globalen  \u00d6kosysteme s i-\nchern.1 Neben dem Fehlen einer genauen Definition gibt es \u2013  anders als bei anderen Ergebni s-\nsen der Rio+20 -Konferenz \u2013 auch keine Vorgaben f \u00fcr einen konkreten, koordinierten Folg e-\nprozess mit Zielen und Zeitvorgaben. Stattdessen forderte die Konferenz Staaten, internati o-\nnale Institutionen und andere relevante Akteure auf, ihre Anstrengungen zum Aufbau einer \ngr\u00fcnen Wirtschaft zu intensivieren.  \nEine Anzahl von L \u00e4ndern in aller Welt sind dieser Aufforderung nachgekommen, sei es, indem \nsie neue Prog ramme und Initiativen f \u00fcr eine gr \u00fcne Wirtschaft auf den Weg gebracht haben, \noder indem sie vorhandene Anstrengungen intensiviert haben. Auf diese Weise verbreitet sich \nder Begriff des gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaftens, und wird durch eine Vielzahl von Initiativen weltw eit \nmit Leben gef \u00fcllt. Eine \u2013 wirtschaftlich wie geographisch  \u2013 heterogene Gruppe von L \u00e4ndern \nwie Brasilien, China, Costa Rica, Indien, S\u00fcdafrika, S \u00fcdkorea, Uruguay oder Vietnam verfolgt \ndezidierte Initiativen, Strategien oder Programme f \u00fcr eine gr \u00fcne Wirtschaft, und baut auf di e-\nse Weise einen Schatz an Wissen und Erfahrungen auf.2 \nDieser wachsende Bestand an praktischen Erfahrungen aus aller Welt  wird lose koordiniert \ndurch UNEP, das Umweltprogramm der Vereinten Nationen . UNEP  dient als Plattform f \u00fcr \nden Austausch von Informationen und Erfahrungen, die durch die nationalen Aktivit \u00e4ten g e-\nwonnen werden , und tr \u00e4gt so dazu bei, aus der praktischen Erfahr ung ein gemeinsames Ver-\nst\u00e4ndnis des gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaftens zu erarbeiten. Die Arbeit von UNEP wird dabei ge leitet von \neinem flexiblen und bewusst breit gehaltenen Grundverst \u00e4ndnis des gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaftens. \nDemnach ist gr \u00fcnes Wirtschaften eine Wirtschaftsform, die menschliches Wohlbefinden und \nsozialen Ausgleich f \u00f6rdert, und zugleich Umweltrisiken und \u00f6kologisch e Gefahren sp \u00fcrbar \nverringert. Auf einen einfachen Nenner gebracht: eine gr \u00fcne Wirtschaft kommt ohne fossile \nRessourcen aus, ist ressourceneffizient und sozial inklusiv.3 \nW\u00e4hrend dieses Grundverst \u00e4ndnis allgemein akzeptiert ist, erscheint es unwahrscheinlich, \ndass in absehbarer Zeit eine genaue Definition der \u201e gr\u00fcnen Wirtschaft\u201c  vereinbart werden \nkann \u2013 nicht zuletzt, weil L \u00e4nder in aller Welt darauf hinweisen, dass der Begriff an unte r-\nschiedlichen Orten, in unterschiedlichen kulturellen und sozio\u00f6 konomischen Bedingungen \neine unterschiedliche Bedeutung haben wird. Dennoch werden aus den vielf \u00e4ltigen nationalen \nInitiativen  und aus den politischen und wissenschaftlichen Diskussionen  die Grundelemente \nder \u201egr\u00fcnen Wirtschaft\u201c deutlich:  \n1 United Nations, \u201cThe Future We Want - Outcome Document.\u201d  \n2 Samans, \u201cGreen Growth and the Post -2015 Development Agenda: An Issue Paper for the United Nations High -\nLevel Panel of Eminent Persons,\u201d 5.  \n3 UNEP, Towards a Green Economy . p.16 \n 9 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \n\u25b8 \u201cGr\u00fcnes Wirtschaf ten\u201d ist ein neues, anderes Verst \u00e4ndnis von wirtschaftlicher En t-\nwicklung. Die Grenzen des bestehenden, wachstumsbasierten Wirtschaftsmodells wer-\nden immer sichtbarer und greifbarer \u2013  dazu z \u00e4hlen zunehmende Krise und Instabilit \u00e4t, \nzune hmende Ungleichheit in der Verteilung von Verm \u00f6gen und Einkommen, \u00dc bernu t-\nzung und Zerst \u00f6rung nat \u00fcrlicher Ressourcen, und zunehmende \u00f6ffentliche Unzufri e-\ndenheit  und wachsender Widerstand in manchen Teilen der Welt . W\u00e4hrend der letzten \nbeiden Jahrzehnte haben verschiedene Weltregi onen eine Phase schnellen und kont i-\nnuierlichen Wachstums durchlaufen. Dieses Wachstum hat es erm \u00f6glicht, Hunderte \nvon Millionen Menschen aus der Armut zu befreien, und hat zum Entstehen einer ne u-\nen globalen Mittelschicht gef \u00fchrt. Aber das Wachstum hat auch  zu neuen Problemen \ngef\u00fchrt. So sind etwa die Fr \u00fcchte des Wachstums ungleich verteilt, in vielen L \u00e4ndern \nkommt ein gro\u00dfer Teil des neu entstandenen Einkommens nur einem vergleichsweise \nkleinen Teil der Bev \u00f6lkerung zu Gute. Wachsende Ungleichheit \u2013 sowohl bei Verm \u00f6gen \nals auch bei Einkommen \u2013  lassen sich sowohl in Industriel\u00e4 ndern als auch in Schwe l-\nlen- und Entwicklungsl \u00e4ndern beobachten. Daher stellt sich in all diesen L \u00e4ndern die \nHerausforderung, dass das Wachstum integrativ ist, und breite Bev \u00f6lkerungssc hichten \ndaran teilhaben.  Zudem ging das rasante wirtschaftliche Wachstum einher mit einem \nebenso rasanten Anstieg des Verbrauchs an Energie und nat \u00fcrlichen Ressourcen. Die \n\u00dcbernutzung nat \u00fcrlicher Ressourcen hat massive Konsequenzen in Form von Umwel t-\nsch\u00e4den und Umweltverschmutzung, und in der Folge auch f \u00fcr menschliche Gesun d-\nheit und Wohlergehen. Die Folge ist, dass wirtschaftliches Wachstum (gemessen durch \nsteigende Einkommen) nicht zu einer entsprechend gro\u00df en Verbesserung der Leben s-\nqualit \u00e4t f\u00fchrt: die sc h\u00e4dlichen Nebenwirkungen des Wirtschaftswachstum, wie U m-\nweltzerst \u00f6rung und Gesundheitssch \u00e4den, machen einen Teil der positiven Effekte stei-\ngender Einkommen zunichte.  \n\u25b8 Der Begriff des gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaftens muss sich auf die dr \u00e4ngendsten globalen Trends \nund He rausforderungen beziehen.  Er muss also den ge \u00e4nderten Umst \u00e4nden Rechnung \ntragen, die sich aus mehr als zwei Jahrzehnten \u00f6konomischer Globalisierung ergeben \nhaben, wie etwa dem Entstehen einer globalen Mittelschicht. Und es muss die globalen \nHerausforderung en aufgreifen, mit denen sich die Welt konfrontiert sieht \u2013 allem v o-\nran Klimawandel und der R \u00fcckgang der Artenvielfalt \u2013 und eine gemeinsame globale \nAntwort auf diese Herausforderungen voranbringen.  \n\u25b8 Gr\u00fcnes Wirtschaften muss ganzheitlich gedacht werden: es geht darum, die gesamte \nVolkswirtschaft umzubauen, und nicht nur bestimmte \u201cgr \u00fcne\u201d Branchen oder Techn o-\nlogien zu f \u00f6rdern.  Dennoch gibt es nat \u00fcrlich bestimmte Branchen, die f \u00fcr die Transfo r-\nmation zum gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaften von besonderer Bedeutung sind. Dazu z \u00e4hlen in er s-\nter Linie energie-  und ressourceninten sive Branchen wie die Energiewirtschaft, Ber g-\nbau, Grundstoffindustrien und andere energieintensive Industriebranchen, Land - und \nForstwirtschaft, Fischerei und Verkehr.4 Zwar k \u00f6nnen technologische Innovation en \nhelfen, den Energie - und Ressourcenverbrauch dieser Branchen zu senken. Aber zur \nL\u00f6sung werden auch soziale, organisatorische und institutionelle Innovationen geh \u00f6-\nren, etwa grundlegend andere Wege, um menschliche Bed \u00fcrfnisse zu befriedigen. Die-\nser Proze ss wird letztlich auch auf einen \u00f6kologischen Strukturwandel herauslaufen, in \ndessen Folge wirtschaftliche Wohlfahr t viel weniger an die F \u00f6rderung, Verarbeitung \n4 African Development Bank, Sierra Leone: Transitioning Towards Green Growth. Stocktaking and the Way Fo r-\nward , 32. \n 10 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nund Verwendung nat \u00fcrlicher Ressourcen gekoppelt ist, sondern Ressourcenverbrauch \ndurch intelligente Dienstleistungen ersetzt wird. Ein solcher Strukturwandel bedeutet \ndaher auch einen Umbau des Kapitalstocks, und ein Umleiten von Investitionsfl\u00fc ssen, \neine Verschiebung der Nachfrage nach bestimmten G \u00fctern und Dienstleistungen, und \ndamit auch \u00c4 nderung en in Preisen und der Renditeerwartung bereits get \u00e4tigter Inve s-\ntitionen. Auch deshalb wird eine solcher Umbau auf Widerstand sto \u00dfen \u2013 insbesondere \nauf den Widerstand derjenigen, die in das bestehende Modell ressourcenintensiven \nWachstums investiert haben.  \n\u25b8 Da der Umbau zum gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaften eine Reihe von Branchen und Sektoren b e-\ntreffen wird, ist es um so wichtiger dass Nachhaltigkeitserfordernisse in alle anderen \nPolitikfelder integriert  werden , um so auch den notwendigen institutionellen und \nstrukturellen Wandel m \u00f6glich zu machen. Dies legt auch nahe, dass es einen breiten \nMix aus Politikinstrumenten wird geben m \u00fcssen, wozu sowohl neue Instrumente geh\u00f6-\nren als auch die Reform bestehender, evtl. kontraproduktiver Instrumente.  \n\u25b8 Um den Umbau zum gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaften voranzubringen, bedarf es auch einer Re-\nform der institutionellen  Rahmenbedingungen auf nationaler und internationaler Eb e-\nne. Dazu geh\u00f6 ren etwa die Regeln und Regularien, die derzeit ma \u00dfgeblich sind f \u00fcr die \nwirtschaftliche Entwicklung, etw a im Handelsrecht, im Finanzsektor, oder bei Investi-\ntionen.5 Diese Regularien sollten starker auf die Ziele f \u00fcr menschliche Entwicklung \nausgerichtet sein, etwa die Millenium -Entwicklungsziele der UN (MDGs) oder zuk \u00fcnf-\ntige Nachhaltigkeitsziele (SDGs). Weitere Ankn \u00fcpfungspunkte und \u00dc berschneidungen \nbestehen etwa mit den laufenden Initiativen, neue und bessere Indikatoren f \u00fcr wirt-\nschaftliche  Wohlfahrt und gesellschaftlichen Fortschritt zu etablieren, also das BIP a b-\nzul\u00f6sen.  \n\u25b8 Die gr \u00fcne Wirtschaft wird eine dynam ische , prosperierende  Wirtschaft sein, geleitet \nvon Innovationen aller Art, und angetrieben von Fortschritten bei Ressourceneffizienz \nund Produktivit \u00e4t. Dabei ist es jedoch unabdingbar, dass die Wirtschaft sich innerhalb \nder planet aren Grenzen bewegt, die durch die Tragf \u00e4higkeit der nat \u00fcrlichen \u00d6kosyst e-\nme definiert werden. Dazu muss die wirtschaftliche Wertsch \u00f6pfung zwingend vom Ver-\nbrauch nat \u00fcrlicher Ressourcen entkoppelt werden. Gleichzeitig muss das Wachstum in-\ntegrativ sein, so dass a lle Teile der Gesellschaft am erzeugten Wohlstand teilhaben.  \nPolitikinstrumente f\u00fcr eine gr\u00fcne Wirtschaft  \nUnabh\u00e4 ngig davon, wie genau gr \u00fcnes W irtschaften in den jeweiligen L \u00e4ndern definiert wird, \nwird es verschiedene politische Interventionen und einen Mix aus Politikinstrumenten ben \u00f6ti-\ngen, um das gegenw \u00e4rtige wirtschaftliche Modell in Richtung  des gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaftens zu \nver\u00e4ndern. 6 Marktbasierte Instrumente, wie etwa Steuern und Emissionshandel, k \u00f6nnen d a-\nbei eine zentrale Rolle spielen: um eine dynamische wirtschaftliche  Entwicklung in Richtung \nNachhaltigkeit zu initiie ren, k\u00f6nnen M \u00e4rkte eine wichtige Rolle spielen. An sich k \u00f6nnen \nM\u00e4rkte au \u00dferordentlich n \u00fctzlich sein, wenn es darum geht Innovationen zu stimulieren, die \nVerbreitung neuer Technologien zu beschleunige, und private Akteure \u2013 als Innovatoren und \nUnternehmer \u2013 an dem Umbau zu einer gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaft zu bet eiligen. Gleichzeitig wird es \nn\u00f6tig sein, die Funktionsweise von M \u00e4rkten dort zu korrigieren, wo sie versagen, insbesondere \nwo Preissignale die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung in die falsche Richtung lenken.  \n5 Poppe et al., \u201cIs Something Wrong with the Green Economy?,\u201d 12.  \n6 UNEP, Measuring Progress towards an Inclusive Green Economy , 25. \n11 UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nDie Preise m\u00fcssen die \u00f6kologische Wahrheit sagen  \nEine Umweltpolitik, die versucht gegen den Markt zu regulieren, ist zum Scheitern verurteilt. \nWenn die Preissignale, die  Investitions - und Konsumentscheidungen leiten, durchg \u00e4ngig in \neine andere Richtung weisen als zu einer gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaft, bedarf es eines sehr starken R e-\ngulators \u2013 oder sehr aufgekl\u00e4 rter und hoch moti vierter Verbraucher und Investoren. Leider \ngilt, dass die Preise wichtiger Ha ndelsg \u00fcter weit davon entfernt sind, die \u201c \u00f6kologische (und \nsoziale) Wahrheit\u201d \u00fcber die gehandelten Produkte zum Ausdruck zu bringen. Was die Preise \nnicht, oder nur ansatzweise, zum Ausdruck bringen, sind die externen Kosten, die \u00fcber den \nLebenszyklus eines  Produktes anfallen \u2013  etwa die sozialen und \u00f6kologischen Folgen des Res-\nsourcenabbaus, der Verarbeitung, des Transports, der Nutzung und der Entsorgung von Pr o-\ndukten. Diese Tatsache f \u00fchrt zu einem massiven Marktversagen: da die externen Kosten nicht \nin den Preisen zum Ausdruck kommen, werden nat \u00fcrliche Ressourcen \u2013 und die Produkte, die \ndamit hergestellt wurden, zu billig gehandelt. Die Kosten allerdings fallen trotzdem an \u2013 sie \nwerden aber nicht von den Verbrauchern geza hlt, sondern auf andere abgew \u00e4lzt, un ter and e-\nrem in Form von Umweltzerst \u00f6rung.7  Der Wert dieses Marktversagens l\u00e4 uft in die Billionen \nUS-Dollar.8 \nAus diesem Grund sollte es ein zentraler Bestandteil jedweder politischen Strategie f \u00fcr gr\u00fcnes \nWirtschaften sein, dass die Preise die \u00f6kologischen  und sozialen Folgekosten zum Ausdruck \nbringen. Oder, um es mit den Worten von Ernst -Ulrich von Weizs \u00e4cker auszudr \u00fccken:  Die \nPreise m \u00fcssen die \u00f6kologische Wahrheit sagen. Daf \u00fcr ist einerseits ein Abbau umweltsch \u00e4dli-\ncher Subventionen n\u00f6tig, und andererseit s die Einf \u00fchrung bzw. der Ausbau von marktbasie r-\nten Instrumenten, die die externen Kosten dem Verursacher anlasten, und so daf \u00fcr sorgen \ndass die externen Kosten in die wirtschaftliche Entscheidungsfindung einbezogen werden. An \nmarktbasierten Instrumenten g ibt es grunds \u00e4tzlich verschiedene Optionen, darunter Umwel t-\nsteuern und Systeme handelbarer Zertifikate, wie etwa Emissionshandel. Wenn sie richtig \ngestaltet sind, k \u00f6nnen diese Instrumente sehr wirksam und gleichzeitig effizient sein, um \nUmweltziele zu geringen Kosten und mit gro \u00dfer Verl \u00e4sslichkeit zu erreichen. Zudem erzeugen \nmarktbasierte Instrumente Einkommen, das genutzt werden kann um unerw \u00fcnschte Nebe n-\nwirkungen zu lindern, etwa Verteilungswirkungen auf besonders betroffene Gruppen.  Gleic h-\nzeitig haben v iele L \u00e4nder die Erfahrung gemacht, dass es alles andere als trivial ist, marktba-\nsierte Instrumente richtig zu gestalten und sie entsprechend umzusetzen. Und auch wenn \ndies gelingt, gilt dennoch dass marktbasierte Instrumente zwar ein wesentlicher Bestandte il \ndes Instrumentenmixes f \u00fcr ein gr \u00fcnes Wirtschaften sein sollten, dass sie jedoch als alleiniges \nInstrument nicht ausreichend sind. Die Grenzen marktbasierter Instrumente sind ebenso an-erkannt wie ihre Vorteile; daher ist es sinnvoll dass marktbasierte In strumente durch andere \nPolitikinstrumente erg \u00e4nzt werden, wie etwa durch gezielte Technologief \u00f6rderung, Forschung \nund Entwicklung, aber auch durch ordnungsrechtliche Vorgaben.\n9 \nMessen, worauf es ankommt  \nDie Tatsache, dass das aktuell vorherrschende Modell wirtschaftlicher Entwicklung nicht in \nder Lage ist, zu gesellschaftlich optimalen Ergebnissen zu f \u00fchren, h\u00e4 ngt eng damit zusammen \nwie wirtschaftliche Entwicklung gemessen wird. Die weltweit etablierte Ma \u00dfzahl f \u00fcr wir t-\nschaftliches Wohlergehen ist das Bruttoinlandsprodukt (BIP).  \nDas Problem ist, dass das Bruttoinlandsprodukt urspr \u00fcnglich als Ma \u00dfzahl f \u00fcr den Gesam t-\nwert der wirtschaftlichen Produktion eingef \u00fchrt wurde. Es ist jedoch nicht  daf\u00fcr gemacht, als \n7 UNEP, Driving a Green Economy Through Public Finance and Fiscal Policy Reform . \n8 Trucost, Natural Capital at Risk: The Top 100 Externalities of Business . \n9 International Labour Organization and UNEP, Working towards Sustainable Development: Opportunities for \nDecent Work and Social Inclusion in a Green Economy , 164.  \n 12 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nMa\u00df f\u00fcr das Entwicklungsniveau (oder den wirtschaftlichen Fortschritt) eines Landes zu di e-\nnen, oder das Wohlergehen oder die Lebensqualit \u00e4t seiner Einwohner zu messen.10 Wird das \nBIP in diesem Sinn verwendet, f \u00fchrt es in der Regel zu verzerrten Ergebnissen, da das BIP \nschlicht viele Faktoren nicht  erfasst, die f \u00fcr menschliches Wohlergehen entscheidend sind. So \ngibt das BIP nur das aggregierte Einkommen eines Landes wieder, ist aber blind daf \u00fcr, wie \ngerecht oder ungerecht dieses Einkommen verteilt ist. Des weiteren werden Umweltzerst \u00f6-\nrung und seine Folgekosten nicht vom BIP erfasst. Erst, wenn Geld aufgewendet wird um die \nFolgen der Umweltzerst \u00f6rung zu beheben, schlagen diese sich im BIP nieder. Dann allerdings \nabsurderweise als Steigerung des BIP, obwohl es allen Beteiligten besser ginge, wenn der \nSchaden gar nicht erst eingetreten w \u00e4re. \nIm Anbetracht der verschiedenen Begrenzungen und Schw \u00e4chen des BIP, und angesichts des \nBedarfs an einem Indikator, der ein breiteres Verst \u00e4ndnis von menschlichem Wohlergehen \nund Lebensqualit \u00e4t abbildet, stellt sich d ie Frage wie man vom BIP zu einem ausgewogeneren \nIndikator gelangen kann. In der k \u00fcrzesten Form sind die Alternativen erstens eine Korrektur \ndes BIP \u2013  indem die Komponenten, die es derzeit nicht misst, monet\u00e4 r bewertet und aufg e-\nschlagen bzw. abgezogen werd en; zweitens Ersatz des BIP durch eine einzelnes anderes, ag g-\nregiertes Ma \u00df f\u00fcr menschliches Wohlergehen; oder drittens Erg \u00e4nzung des BIP mit wenigen \nanderen Indikatoren, die als \u201e Armaturenbrett\u201c einen einfachen und schnellen \u00dc berblick \u00fcber \ndie verschiedenen Aspekte menschlichen Wohlergehens und wirtschaftlicher Wohlfahrt li e-\nfern.11 Ein solcher Indikatorensatz k \u00f6nnte eine interessante Gelegenheit bieten, drei Prozesse \nzu verkn \u00fcpfen, die im Abschlussdokument der Rio+20 -Konferenz angesto \u00dfen werden: den \nUmbau zu gr \u00fcnem Wirtschaften, die Vereinbarung von Nachhaltigkeitszielen (und demnach, \nzu einem sp \u00e4teren Zeitpunkt, auch zugeh\u00f6rigen Indikatoren), und die Aufforderung, ausgew o-\ngenere Indikatoren f \u00fcr wi rtschaftliche Wohlfahrt und wirtschaftlichen Fortschritt zu etabli e-\nren. \nInvestitionen mobilisieren und Strukturwandel steuern \nDer Umbau zu einem gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaften wird notwendigerweise mit einem Strukturwandel \nverbunden sein. Die vorherrschenden Strukturen, in denen Wertsch \u00f6pfung zu einem gro \u00dfen \nTeil durch die F \u00f6rderung und Veredelung nat \u00fcrlicher Ressourcen entsteht, haben uns in das \naktuelle Dilemma gef \u00fchrt. Um dem in Richtung eines nachhaltigen, gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaftens zu \nentkommen, wird daher einen Wandel in der Arte und Weise erfordern, wie Wertsch \u00f6pfung \nstattfindet.  \nDas bedeutet auch, dass Politiken f \u00fcr gr \u00fcnes Wirtschaften in manchen Branchen zu Wach s-\ntum f \u00fchren werden, in anderen jedoch das Wachstum begrenzen oder auch die Schrumpfung \ngestalten m \u00fcssen , Einige Branchen werden sich quasi per definition bei den Gewinnern dieses \nUmbaus finden \u2013  neben Herstellern von Technologien f \u00fcr erneuerbare Energien und Energi e-\neffizienz sind dies auch die Wasser - und Abfallwirtschaft, aber auch viele Dienstleistung s-\nbranchen, Informations - und Kommunikationstechnologien , (nachhaltiger) Tourismus, Kul-\nturschaffende und kreative Industrien.12 F\u00fcr eine Reihe von Branchen bietet der Umbau s o-\nwohl Chancen als auch Risiken \u2013  wie etwa f \u00fcr die Energiewirtschaft, das verarbeitende G e-\nwerbe, Chemikalien, Verkehr und die Bauwirtschaft, aber auch Land - und Forstwirtschaft \n10 Stiglitz, Sen, and Fitoussi, Report by the Commission on the  Measurement of Economic Performance and Social \nProgress , 8. \n11 Philipp Schepelmann, Yanne Goossens, and Arttu Makipaa, Towards Sustainable Development: Alternatives to \nGDP for Measuring Progress . \n12 UN Environment Management Group, Working towards a Balanced and Inclusive Green Economy: A United \nNations System-Wide Perspective , 13. \n 13 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nund Fischerei.13 Und schlie\u00dflich gibt es ein paar Branchen, f \u00fcr die der Umbau zu gr \u00fcnem \nWirtschaften in erster Linie eine Bedrohung ihres Gesch \u00e4ftsmodels darstellt \u2013  allem voran \nBergbau fossiler Energiequellen und Raffinerien. Auch wenn diese Branchen nicht \u00fcber Nacht \nverschwinden werden, wird sich das Marktvolumen f \u00fcr diese Branchen doch sp\u00fcrbar verri n-\ngern. Eine besondere Herausforderung f \u00fcr den Umbau zu einer gr \u00fcnen Wirt schaft ist es daher, \nauch Unternehmen in diesen Branchen neue Perspektiven zu er \u00f6ffnen.  \nEine weitere Herausforderung wird darin bestehen, die n \u00f6tigen Investitionen zu mobilisieren, \nund Investitionsstr \u00f6me in Richtung ressourceneffizienter, post -fossiler Tec hnologien umzulei-\nten. Die zuvor erw \u00e4hnten marktbasierten Instrumente k \u00f6nnen hier eine Rolle spielen, um \n\u201cgr\u00fcne\u201d Investitionen attraktiver zu machen. Dar \u00fcber hinaus werden jedoch auch andere I n-\nstrumente und Ma \u00dfnahmen n\u00f6 tig sein, um private Investitionen anz ureizen, wie etwa Invest i-\ntionszusch \u00fcsse, langfristige Garantien oder Instrumente zur Umverteilung von Investitionsr i-\nsiken. Das Aufkommen aus marktbasierten Instrumenten \u2013  Aufkommen aus Umweltsteuern, \noder Erl\u00f6se aus dem Verkauf von Emissionsberechtigungen \u2013  k\u00f6nnen dazu beitragen, solche \nInvestitionszusch \u00fcsse zu finanzieren.14 Und schlie \u00dflich hat der Staat selbst eine Vorbildfun k-\ntion, als einer der gr \u00f6\u00dften Investoren in der Volkswirtschaft: durch \u00f6 ffentliche Beschaffung \nund \u00f6ffentlich -private Investitionspart nerschaften hat der Staat direkte Kontrolle \u00fcber einen \nerheblichen Anteil aller Investitionen in einer Volkswirtschaft, und kann diesen Einfluss nu t-\nzen um einen Markt f \u00fcr klimafreundliche und ressourcenschonende Technologien und Diens t-\nleistungen entstehen und reifen zu lassen  \nTraining und Bildung  \nZu den Ma\u00dfnahmen, um einen Strukturwandel zu steuern, geh\u00f6ren auch Bildung und Trai-\nning. Dies ist auf zwei Arten relevant: einerseits f\u00fcr die Branchen und Unternehmen, f \u00fcr die \nder Umbau zum gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaften eine grundlegende \u00c4 nderung ihres Gesch\u00e4 ftsmodells \nund ihrer Produktionsprozesse erforderlich macht. Hier geht es darum, die neuen Fertigkeiten \nzu vermitteln, die f \u00fcr die neuen Gesch \u00e4ftsmodelle oder Technologien n \u00f6tig sind. Andererseits \nbedeutet Strukturwandel aber auch, dass es zu einer Verlagerung von Arbeitskr \u00e4ften \u00fcber \nBranchengrenzen hinweg kommen wird .15 Die neuen Arbeitsverh \u00e4ltnisse werden sich vor a l-\nlem in den Gewinnerbranchen finden (erneuerbare Energien und Energieeffizienz, Wasser - \nund Abfallwirtschaft, aber auch viele Dienstleistungsbranchen), w \u00e4hrend die  Besch \u00e4ftung in \nressourcen - und energieintensiven Branchen zur \u00fcckgehen wird. Die Wertsch \u00f6pfung in den \nGewinnerbranchen ist dabei deutlich besch \u00e4ftigungsintensiver ist als in den V erliererbra n-\nchen. Der Umbau zum gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaften hat somit das Potenzial, neue Arbeitspl \u00e4tze zu \nschaffen und die Besch \u00e4ftigung insgesamt deutlich zu steigern. Aber um diese Ver \u00e4nderung \ndes Arbeitsmarkts zu gestalten, und die Mobilit \u00e4t von Arbeitnehmern \u00fcber Branchengrenzen \nhinweg zu erm \u00f6glichen, werden umfangreiche Trainings - und Fortbildungsma\u00dfnahmen n\u00f6 tig \nsein. Die OECD schl\u00e4 gt hierf \u00fcr eine dreiteilige Strategie vor:16 \n1.

Der Umbau wird sich nicht darauf beschr\u00e4 nken, b e-\nstimmte \u201cgr \u00fcne\u201d Branchen oder Technologien zu f \u00f6rdern. Um einen Wandel der gesamten \nWirtschaft zu bewerkstel ligen, gilt es Innovationsprozesse zu ver \u00e4ndern, Investitionsfl \u00fcsse \numzuleiten, Arbeitskr \u00e4ften das n \u00f6tige Wissen und die n \u00f6tigen Fertigkeiten zu vermitteln, und \ndie richtigen institutionellen und rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen zu schaffen. Damit der \nUmbau gelingt, ist es n \u00f6tig dass alle wirtschaftlichen Sektoren daran beteiligt werden, und \ndass die Anstrengungen  angemessen verteilt sind. Ein integrierter, sektor \u00fcbergreifender A n-\nsatz ist auch ein Gebot der Effizienz \u2013 je besser die Anstrengungen verteilt sin d, desto geri n-\nger fallen die Gesamtkosten aus.  \nDer Instrumentenmix  f\u00fcr den Umbau zum gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaften muss daher sowohl sektorale \nStrategien umfassen, als auch branchen\u00fcbergreifende Instrumente, die die Anstrengungen \nzwischen den einzelnen Branchen vert eilen und koordinieren. Um die n \u00f6tige Akzeptanz zu \nschaffen, sollte ein intelligenter Instrumentenmix auch flankierende Ma \u00dfnahmen beinhalten \n\u2013 die gegebenenfalls die wirtschaftlichen Lasten der Transformation umverteilen, und beson-\nders gef \u00e4hrdeten Branchen oder Teilen der Gesellschaft in der Anpassung unterst \u00fctzen.  \nAber \u00fcber die klassischen Instrumente der Umweltpolitik und flankierende Ma \u00dfnahmen hi n-\naus, sollte ein Instrumentenmix f \u00fcr gr \u00fcnes Wirtschaften auch die n \u00f6tigen Rahmenbedingun-\ngen f \u00fcr die Transformation schaffen. Dazu geh\u00f6 ren etwa Initiativen in Bildung und For-\nschung; Ma\u00dfnahmen, um Akteure zu vernetzen und Allianzen zu bilden; gesellschaftliche \nTriebkr \u00e4fte zu b \u00fcndeln, und auch die kulturelle Dimension des Umbaus zu beleuchten. Dazu \ngeh\u00f6ren aber auch  \u00c4nderungen des institutionellen und rechtlichen Rahmens, insbesondere \ndort wo bestehende Institutionen einem Wandel im Wege stehen \u2013 wie Staatsmonopole f \u00fcr die \nF\u00f6rderung fossiler Ressourcen, fehlende oder verzerrte M \u00e4rkte f \u00fcr Energieressourcen, oder \nauch H \u00f6chstpreise f \u00fcr Kraftstoffe oder Strom.  \nDer Begriff des gr \u00fcnen Wirtschaftens kann damit ein neues Verst \u00e4ndnis liefern, wie die Wirt-\nschaft im Dienste des Menschen funktionieren kann, so dass Menschen in aller Welt gl\u00fcckl i-\ncher, l \u00e4nger und ges \u00fcnder leben, ohne dabei die nat \u00fcrlichen Ressourcen zu \u00fcbernutzen. Der \nvielf \u00e4ltige Nutzen einer solchen Wirtschaftsform ist in zahlreichen Studien untersucht und \ndokumentiert worden, von lokalen Fallstudien bis hin zu weltweiten \u00f6 konomischen Modellen. \nUnd, wichtiger noch \u2013 die Zeit ist reif f \u00fcr ein neues Wirtschaftsmodell, da die Grenzen des a k-\ntuellen Modells immer deutlicher zu Tage treten. All dies bedeutet jedoch nicht, dass das gr\u00fc-ne Wirtschaften ein Selbstl\u00e4 ufer ist \u2013  dieses Papier diskutiert einige der Bedingungen,  die \nn\u00f6tig sind um der Idee zum Durchbruch zu verhelfen.  \n  \n 15 \n UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \n2 Summary  \nGreen Economy: the Concept  and the Challenge of Defining it  \nThe concept of a \u201dgreen economy\u201d has been around for a few years, but has gained in recogn i-\ntion and weight following the Rio+20 C onference in 2012, which featured the green economy \nas one of its central themes  and recognised it as \u201cone of the important tools available for \nachieving sustainable development\u201d , in order to satisfy the needs of a growing world popula-\ntion within the finit e carrying capacity of global ecosystems. However, while the summit re c-\nognised the importance of the \u201cgreen economy\u201d concept, it did not specify a concrete definition \nof what the green economy actually is. Rather , it described  what it is supposed to achieve: to \n\u201ccontribute to eradicating poverty as well as sustained economic growth, enhancing social in-\nclusion, improving human welfare and creating opportunities for employment and decent work for all, while maintaining the health y functioning of the Earth\u2019s ecosystems.\u201d\n17 Also, i n con-\ntrast to other agenda items , the Rio+20 Conference did not specify a concrete follow -up process \nwith targets and timetables for the green economy . Rather , it encouraged and invited coun-\ntries, internati onal institutions and stakeholders to intensify their green economy efforts in \ntheir respective roles.  \nA number of countries around the world have responded to the call issued by the Rio+20 co n-\nference, either by launching new policies and strategies for a  green economy, or by intensif y-\ning their existing efforts. Thus, the concept of a green economy is increasingly gaining hold on \nthe ground, through a number of concrete initiatives in various countries. An economically and geographically diverse group of c ountries \u2013 including, for example, Brazil, China, Costa \nRica, India, Korea, South Africa, Urug uay or Vietnam \u2013  is currently pursuing green economy \npolicies, building up a body of experience and evidence in the process.\n18  \nThese efforts are loosely coordinat ed by UNEP, which serves as an information hub to promote \nexchange on best practices , thereby shaping a common understanding of a green economy. \nUNEP\u2019s efforts are based on a flexible working definition of the green economy as an economy that \u201cresults in i mproved human well -being and social equity, while significantly reducing \nenvironmental risks and ecological scarcities. In its simplest expression, a green economy can be thought of as one which is low carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive.\u201d\n19  \nThus, while  there is no exact definition of what constitutes a green economy , and while cou n-\ntries emphasise that the concept will take on a different meaning in different places and ci r-\ncumstances , there are however some constituting elements and essential features of the green \neconomy concept that can be inferred from the political and academic discussions and negotia-\ntions:  \n\u25b8 The concept of a green economy represents a new model of economic development . The \nlimitations of the existing paradigm of economic growth and development are becoming \never more visible and tangible (economic crisis and instability, growing income inequa l-\nity, environmental degradation, dissatisfaction and unrest). Over the last two decades, several world regions have achieved rapid and  continuous economic growth. This \ngrowth has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and enabled the emergence of a new global middle class. But it also presents a new set of challenges. For instance, in many countries, the benefits of growth have been distributed unequally, with most \n17 United Nations, \u201cThe Future We Want - Outcome Document.\u201d  \n18 Samans, \u201cGreen Growth and the Post -2015 Development Agenda: An Issue Paper for the United Nations High -\nLevel Panel of Eminent Persons,\u201d 5.  \n19 UNEP, Towards a Green Economy . p.16 \n 16 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nbenefits accruing within a small segment of the population. Increasing inequality in \nthe distribution of incomes and wealth can be observed in developing and industriali s-\ning countries alike; often as a result of economic po licies for which the need to adjust to \neconomic globalisation is invoked as justification. Therefore, in developing and devel-\noped countries alike, the challenge is to make sure that economic growth is inclusive, \ni.e. that incomes rise across all segments of population. Also, the rapid economic \ngrowth in many parts of the world has coincided with an equally rapid growth in the \nconsumption of energy, natural resources and other material inputs. The increasing re-source use has a severe impact on the environmen t, and associated impacts on human \nhealth and well -being. As a consequence, economic growth (measured as growth in i n-\ncomes) does not result in a corresponding improvement in welfare : the difference b e-\ntween the two comes in the form of negative side-effects  of economic growth, such as \nenvironmental degradation and the associated impacts on human health.  \n\u25b8 The concept of a green economy must be defined in relation to the most pressing global \ntrends and challenges. Thus, it needs to acknowledge the changed circu mstances after \ntwo decades of economic globalisation, including the rise of a global middle class. And it \nneeds to take up the global challenges that the world is facing \u2013  above all climate \nchange and the loss of biodiversity \u2013  and promote a joint global r esponse to these cha l-\nlenges.  \n\u25b8 The concept of a green economy needs to be based on a holistic approach: it is esse n-\ntially about greening the entire economy , not about fostering a particular \u201cgreen\u201d se c-\ntor. Nonetheless, there are of course certain sectors that are of particular importance \nfor the transformation to a green economy. This includes, above all, carbon-  and r e-\nsource -intensive sectors, such as the energy sector, mining, resource -intensive industry \nand manufacturing, agriculture, forestry, fisherie s, and transport.20 Responses for \nthese sectors will certainly include technological innovations that improve their energy - \nand resource -efficiency. But it will also include social and organisational innovations \u2013  \nfinding entirely new ways of satisfying dem ands. This will ultimately also result in a \nstructural change, where economic welfare is less and less connected to the extraction, processing and use of natural resources, and instead increasingly relies on smart se r-\nvices. This includes a re -allocation of  capital and investment between sectors, a change \nin the demand for certain goods and services, and, accordingly, a change in prices and thus the profitability of existing investments. This will elicit resistance from those \nfirms who have invested into the  current pattern of resource -intensive economic \ngrowth, and expect to see a return on these investments.  \n\u25b8 Correspondingly, as the transformation for a green economy will need to affect a broad \nrange of sectors, sustainability concerns need to be mainstreame d into all policies  to \nbring about the necessary institutional and structural change. This also suggests that there will not be any singular policy instrument to direct the transformation, but \nrather a broad policy mix, consisting of new policies as well a s reform of existing ones. \nIn terms of the policy mix that countries can employ to support the transformation to a green economy, it is understood that economic instruments will have a key role to play.  \n20 African Development Bank, Sierra Leone: Transitioning Towards Green Growth. Stocktaking and the Way Fo r-\nward , 32. \n 17 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \n\u25b8 A green economy will require some amount of reform t o the institutional frameworks at \nnational and international level . In particular, the transformation to a green economy \nimplies a need for reform of the set or rules and institutions that currently shape the \nprocess of economic development, be it in the a rea of trade, finance or investment.21 \nThis should also take into account the sets of targets that are intended to guide human \ndevelopment, such as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Millennium Devel-\nopment Goals (MDGs), as well as their interactions w ith the concept of a green econ-\nomy. Prima facie, there would also seem to be much overlap between the green econ-\nomy concept and the ongoing efforts to arrive at new and better measures of progress \nand economic welfare \u2013 i.e. moving beyond GDP.  \n\u25b8 A green eco nomy will still be a growing and thriving economy, lead by innovations, and \ndriven by increases in efficiency and productivity . But it is imperative that this deve l-\nopment changes into a direction that is commensurate with the limits set by the natu-\nral envi ronment. This necessarily requires that the generation of economic welfare be \ndecoupled from the consumption of natural resources. At the same time, economic \ngrowth needs to be inclusive and enabling \u2013  making sure that the benefits of economic \ndevelopment are shared by all segments of society.  \nPolicies for a Green Economy  \nIrrespective of the exact interpretation of a green economy applied in any country, it will r e-\nquire a range of policy instruments to change the current model of economic development and \nput economies on track to a green economy.22 Market -based policy instruments, such as taxes \nand tradable permit schemes, will have a key role to play in this process: to change the dire c-\ntion of economic development onto a more sustainable trajectory, it will be necessary to make use of markets, but it will be equally essential to correct their functioning where they fail. As \nsuch, markets can be extremely useful to stimulate innovation, to speed up the diffusion of \nnew technologies, and to engage private inves tors and innovators in the transformation pro c-\ness to a green economy. In general, policies for a green economy are therefore well advised to \nbuild on the market dynamic and direct it into a sustainable direction, rather than to work \nagainst it.  \nGet the Pri ces Right  \nAny environmental policy that works against the market is likely to fail. If price signals con-\nsistently direct all investment and consumption decisions in a direction that takes the econ-omy away from a green economy pathway, it becomes very diffi cult to regulate against the \nmarket signals. Alas, the prices of commodities are far from conveying the social and ecolog i-\ncal truth about the traded products. The external costs of production \u2013  i.e. the social and env i-\nronmental impacts that are associated with the mining of resources, the manufacturing, \ntransport, use and disposal of products \u2013 are not fully reflected in their market prices. This \nleads to a massive market failure: The failure to account for external costs means that natural \nresources, and the products that make use of them, are traded too cheaply, because part of \ntheir costs are simply imposed onto others, including future generations, in the form of env i-\nronmental degradation.\n23 The gap in the value of production and of externalities is estim ated \nin the trillions of US$.24 \n21 Poppe et al., \u201cIs Something Wrong with the Green Economy?,\u201d 12.  \n22 UNEP, Measuring Progress towards an Inclusive Green Economy , 25. \n23 UNEP, Driving a Green Economy Through Public Finance and Fiscal Policy Reform . \n24 Trucost, Natural Capital at Risk: The Top 100 Externa lities of Business . \n 18 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nFor this reason, for any green economy policy, a key part of the effort is to \u201cget the prices \nright\u201d by phasing out environmentally harmful subsidies and by introducing pricing mecha-\nnisms that factor the external costs into any economic decision -making. In terms of such pri c-\ning mechanisms, there are different policy options at their disposal, including taxes and tra d-\nable permit schemes. If designed well, they can be both effective and efficient tools \u2013  and they \nhave the potent ial to generate revenue, which can then be used to ameliorate undesirable s o-\ncial side -effects, such as impacts on particularly vulnerable parts of society.  That said, it is \nalso clear that designing and implementing economic instruments in an efficient way  is by no \nmeans trivial. And even if regulators succeed in doing so , it is also widely recognised that \nwhile economic instruments may be necessary to change the direction of economic develop-\nment to a green economy, they are not sufficient. Economic instrum ents have their limit a-\ntions, and therefore need to be supplemented by complementary policies, including R&D su p-\nport as well as command- and-control regulation.25 \nMeasure what matters  \nThe insight that the current model of economic development is not deliverin g socially optimal \noutcomes is closely linked to the way how we currently measure economic progress. Around the world, the gross domestic product (GDP) is firmly established as the guiding indicator for \neconomic development.  \nThe problem with this  is that GDP was conceived as a measure of economic \noutput . But it was \nnever intended to serve as an indicator of the overall development  (or progress) of a society or \na country, and the welfare (or well -being) of the people that live in it.26 If it is used  in this \nsense, GDP is bound to deliver skewed results, as it simply does not account for many factors \nthat are crucial for human well -being. To begin with, GDP will only count the aggregated in-\ncomes in an economy, but it is entirely unaffected by how thes e incomes are distributed. Env i-\nronmental degradation and its costs are not reflected in GDP \u2013  but if money has to be spent to \nclean up the consequences of environmental degradation, these expenses will actually increase \nGDP, and thus appear to be beneficial \u2013 where, in fact, people\u2019s lives would have been better if \nthe damage had been avoided in the first place.  \nAcknowledging the various limitations and shortcomings of GDP, and the need to have indica-tors that are able to measure a much broader concept of h uman well -being and the quality of \nlife, the next question is how to move from the existing GDP to a more complete indicator. In \nshort, the options are either to correct GDP \u2013 by subtracting or adding (in monetary form) \nthose components that it currently does not measure; to substitute GDP with another (aggr e-\ngate) indicator of human well- being; or to complement GDP with other indicators, together \nforming a small set (\u201cdashboard \u201d) of core indicators for human well -being.\n27 Establishing such \na dashboard would provide an opportunity to connect three processes that are laid out in the \noutcome document of the Rio+20 conference: the drive for a green economy, the establishment \nof sustainable development goals (and, eventually, indicators corresponding to these goal s), \nand the call to develop broader measures of progress to complement GDP.  \nMobilise  Investment and Manage Structural Change  \nThe transformation to a green economy will inevitably involve some degree of structural \nchange. The existing economic structures, in which wealth generation is still largely based on \n25 International Labour Organization and UNEP, Working towards Sustainable Development: Opportunities for \nDecent Work and Soc ial Inclusion in a Green Economy , 164.  \n26 Stiglitz, Sen, and Fitoussi, Report by the Commission on the  Measurement of Economic Performance and Social \nProgress , 8. \n27 Philipp Schepelmann, Yanne Goossens, and Arttu Makipaa, Towards Sustainable Development: Alternatives to \nGDP for Measuring Progress . \n 19 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nthe extraction and processing of resources, have lead us to the difficult situation that we are \nfacing. To escape from this dead -end, and to change onto a sustainable development trajectory, \nwill require a change of how value added is generated  in an economy . \nThis implies that green economy policies will promote growth in some sectors, but will dis-\ncourage growth in others. Some sectors will be obvious winners of the transformation to a \ngreen economy \u2013  not only the renewable and energy efficiency technologies as well as water \nand waste management, but also many services, IT, telecommunications, (sustainable) tour-\nism, cultural and creative industries.28 For some sectors, there are challenges and opportun i-\nties \u2013 e.g. the energy sector, manufacturing, chemicals, transport, and construction, but also in \nagriculture, forestry and fishing.29 And there are a few subsectors for which the green eco n-\nomy presents a challenge \u2013  in particular the fossil fuel industry (extr action, refining). They \nmay not disappear entirely, but will see the size of their market diminish considerably. The \nchallenge in designing an industrial policy for the green economy will be to open up new per-\nspectives for businesses operating in the latter category. Just as importantly, industrial pol i-\ncies can assist companies in those sectors that are neither clear winners or clear losers to re c-\nognize and embrace the opportunities brought with the transition to a green economy.  \nTo manage the transformatio n to a green economy, one key challenge will be to mobilise the \nnecessary investments and guide them towards resource -efficient technologies. Using market -\nbased instruments to correct prices will help to make \u201cgreen investments\u201d more attractive. \nBeyond that, other tools for investment support will be needed to create an environment that \ninduces private investment, such as investment subsidies, long -term guarantees and risk -\nsharing arrangements. Revenue from market -based instruments \u2013  such as taxes and permi t \ntrading schemes \u2013 can help to provide the funding for such measures.30 Lastly, the gover n-\nment also has an exemplary function: through public procurement, public work schemes and public -private partnerships, it directly controls a considerable share of inv estments, and can \nuse this market power to build up the market for green economy technologies and services.  \nTraining and Education \nStructural policies for a green economy are tightly linked to training and education. There are \ntwo dimensions to this proce ss: for those sectors and companies where the move to a green \neconomy entails a fundamental change in business models and production processes, there is a \nneed for workplace training to acquire the necessary new skills. But as the green economy \ntransition also entails structural change in the economy, there is also a need for skills deve l-\nopment and education policies to facilitate job transition between sectors.31 The transition \nprocess to a green economy offers considerable potential to generate new employm ent, but it \nalso entails significant labour market restructuring: employment in sustainable sectors will \ngrow, and employment in resource -intensive and polluting sectors will decrease. Yet the la-\nbour force cannot simply be shifted from the \u201cbrown\u201d to the \u201cgreen\u201d sectors and enterprises: to \navoid skill gaps and to minimise transitional unemployment, adequate training and education \nmeasures are necessary.  \n28 UN Environment Management Group, Working towards a Balanced and Inclusive Green Economy: A United \nNations System-Wide Perspective , 13. \n29 International Labour Organization and UNEP, Working towards Sustainable Development: Opportunities for \nDecent Work and Social Inclusion in a Green Economy , ix. \n30 Fisher, \u201cThe Private Sector\u2019s Role in Low Carbon Resilient Development.\u201d  \n31 Ibid.  \n 20 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nTo support the redeployment of the workforce from contracting to expanding sectors during \nthe transition, the OECD argues for a three -legged strategy to enable a smooth and just tran-\nsition .32 This would include:  \n1. Skill development and active labour market policies to support the adaptive capacity of \nlabour markets ; \n2. Moderate employment protection and strong product market competition to promote employment growth in new green competitive niches;  and \n3. Flanking measures like unemployment benefits and in -work benefits to ensure that a \ndynamic labour market is not achieved at the cost of job insecurity or inequality.  \nManage  the Transformation  \nThe transformation to a g reen economy is an economy -wide task, which therefore requires an \nintegrated approach. Greening the economy is not (only) about fostering a particular set of \ngreen sectors or industries , but about transforming the entire economy , which involves chang-\ning innovation patterns, redirecting investment, providing adequate skills and ensuring mobil-\nity of the labour force, and creating the right institutional framework conditions . For the \ntransformation to succeed, it is necessary to balance the efforts across sectors . An integrated, \ncross -sectoral approach  is also a matter of efficiency \u2013  distributing the efforts will help to \nlower the overall cost of the transformation . \nThus, the policy mix for greening the economy needs to include sectoral policies and strategies \nas well as cross -cutting instruments that distribute efforts among sectors. To raise the public \nand political acceptability, a smart policy mix should include  flanking measures \u2013 which rea l-\nlocate  the cost burden of the transition  according to the carrying capacity of economic sectors, \nor segments of society. Where necessary, flanking measures may  provide targeted  assistance \nand temporary relief  to the most affe cted groups .  \nBut beyond environmental policy instruments and flanking measures, a policy mix for the green economy is also about creating the necessary enabling conditions  for the transformation.  \nThis may include educational policies, efforts to connect  actors, forming networks and all i-\nances, generating social momentum, and also cultural change . Creating these enabling cond i-\ntions may also involve institutional and governance reform, e.g. where existing institutions \nlock the economy into a resource - and e nergy -intensive growth pattern \u2013  such as state m o-\nnopolies on resource extraction, lacking or heavily distorted domestic  markets for energy re-\nsources , etc.  \nThus: the concept of a green economy is needed, as a new narrative how the economy should \nwork to en hance the well -being of people around the world. The benefits of a green economy \nare obvious, and have been documented in a number of investigations, from local cas e studies \nto global economic models. And the time is right for a green economy, as the dissa tisfaction \nwith the current economic system is growing, and as its limits are becoming apparent. But \u2013  \ndespite all these factors, that does not mean the green economy  is going to happen by itself. \nThis paper discusses some of the conditions that are necess ary for the concept to gain traction \nand have a lasting impact.  \n  \n32 OECD, Towards green growth , 95. \n 21 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \n3 Introduction: the concept of a green economy  \nOver the last years, the concept of a green economy has enjoyed increasing interest in cou n-\ntries around the world, and has triggered concrete action in a number of places. The concept of \na green economy starts  from the observation that conventional models of economic develo p-\nment are less and less capable of delivering a better life for all but instead impose an increa s-\ning cost on the less fortunate  \u2013 including future generations. While two decades of rapid ec o-\nnomic growth in many parts of the world have lifted m illions out of poverty, the side- effects of \nthis growth can no longer be ignored:  \n\u25b8 Due to the growth of the global economy, and the associated consumption of energy, \nland and resources, global ecosystems are used beyond their carrying capacity.33 Hu-\nman activity has altered the global carbon cycle and disrupted the nitrogen, phospho-rous and sulphur cycles, in many locations it has interfered with  the water cycle, and \ndestroyed a number of ecosystems. The results are environmental degradation, much of which is irreversible, and increasing scarcity of natural resources that can be observed in many parts of the world.\n34 \n\u25b8 Economies around the world are growing, but the benefits of growth are distributed unequally. As a result, income inequality has grown in a majority of OECD countries since the mid -1980s. But also in many emerging economies \u2013 including China, India, \nSouth Africa and Russia \u2013 income ineq uality is high and has been rising since the \n1990s.\n35 The results are social imbalance and unrest in many countries \u2013 manifested in \ndifferent ways, ranging from malnutrition, food insecurity and freshwater scarcity in some parts of the world, to widespread unemployment or falling support for democracy and for the market economy in others.  \n\u25b8 When the current economic paradigm is criticised for prioritising rapid economic growth over social well- being and environmental integrity, it must be stressed that \neven in  terms of economic performance, the picture is mixed: the 2007 -08 financial and \neconomic crisis exposed the instability of the financial system, resulting in a highly volatile boom -and-bust pattern, leading to large -scale devaluation of assets, and pr o-\ntracted economic stagnation in a number of countries.  \nObviously, the green economy is not a panacea that could solve all of these problems, but it \ndoes promise to perform better than the conventional model of economic development.  \n3.1 Rio+20 and the challenge of defining a \u201cgreen economy\u201d  \nThe notion of a \u201cgreen economy\u201d is not a new one \u2013 in various shapes and guises, it has been \naround on the global stage since at least 2008, when UNEP launched its Green Economy Ini-\ntiative. In some countries, such as the Republic of Korea, green economy initiatives and strategies were launched in response to the economic downturn that affected economies \naround the world in 2007- 08 and subsequently.  \nThe concept of a green economy received much more recognition, and gained more political \ntraction, through the Rio+20 Conference in 2012, which featured the green economy as one of \nits central themes. Thus, the Conference for the first time recognised that a \u201cgreen economy in \nthe context of sustainable development and poverty eradication\u201d can be \u201cone of the important \n33 Rocks trom et al., \u201cPlanetary Boundaries: Exploring the Safe Operating Space for Humanit y.\u201d \n34 UNEP, Global Environment Outlook GEO 5 . \n35 OECD, Divided We Stand: Why Inequality Keeps Ris ing. \n22 UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \ntools available for achieving sustainable development\u201d, in order to satisfy the needs of a gro w-\ning world population within the finite carrying  capacity of global ecosystems. However, while \nthe summit recognised the importance of the \u201cgreen economy\u201d concept, it did not specify a co n-\ncrete definition of what the green economy actually is, but rather what it is supposed to \nachieve: to \u201ccontribute to  eradicating poverty as well as sustained economic growth, enhancing \nsocial inclusion, improving human welfare and creating opportunities for employment and \ndecent work for all, while maintaining the healthy functioning of the Earth\u2019s ecosystems.\u201d36 \nFurther more, the outcome document provides more context by listing 16 provisions for what \ngreen economy policies should help achieve \u2013 ranging from technology transfer and sustain-\nable consumption and production patterns to gender equality and the welfare of indig enous \npeoples. \nIn terms of the procedure for defining and implementing a green economy, the outcome docu-\nment underlines the need for flexibility, arguing that different approaches to the green econ-\nomy could be pursued in different countries, and that the g reen economy should be seen as an \noverarching concept, rather than a rigid set of rules. Along the same vein, the Rio outcome \ndocument demands on several accounts that countries should be free to choose their own, n a-\ntionally appropriate approach to impleme nting green economy policies. It does offer some gen-\neral suggestions on procedural elements that could be considered in defining these a p-\nproaches, such as the importance of evaluation and evidence -based policy making and the use \nof a mix of policy instruments (para 63), the involvement of stakeholders (para 64) or the use of information technologies (para 65). It also recognises (in para 66) the need of international cooperation and exchange on green economy efforts, by linking up interested countries and b y \nsharing information on green economy policies and best -practice examples, and invites the \nUnited Nations to coordinate this process.  \nWhile a clear definition and a more concrete follow -up process might have been desirable ou t-\ncomes of the Rio Conference, it remains important that the heads of state adopted the concept, thereby increasing its political weight. The agreement itself was a hard- won compromise, as \nthe green economy emerged to be one of the more controversial negotiation items at the \nRio+20 Conf erence. In particular, some developing countries strictly opposed the concept, fea r-\ning that economic and environmental issues were being given precedence over social and eq-\nuity issues.\n37 This opposition was by no means unanimous: many African countries supported \nthe idea of a \u2018green economy\u2019, whereas several Latin America countries rejected the idea of subjecting nature to economic values.\n38 \n3.2 Follow- up to Rio+20 and the role of the UN  \nIn contrast to other agenda items such as the Sustainable Development Goals,  the Rio+20 \nConference did not specify a concrete follow -up process with targets and timetables for the \ngreen economy, but rather encouraged and invited countries, international institutions and stakeholders to intensify their green economy efforts in their respective roles. This call was \nreiterated by the UNEP Governing Council in February 2013, who \u201cinvites countries to i m-\nplement green economy policies and requests UNEP (E xecutive Director)  to collect initiatives, \nexperiences and practices on different GE  approaches and visions\u201d (Decision 27/8). The key \nrole of individual countries and (environmental) ministers was emphasized, as well as the \nneed to tailor green economy solutions to each country\u2019s needs and circumstances.  \n36 United Nations, \u201cThe Future We Want - Outcome Document.\u201d  \n37 Poppe et al., \u201cIs Something Wrong with the Green Economy?,\u201d 5.  \n38 Bigg, \u201cFive Things We\u2019ve Learnt from Rio+20.\u201d  \n23 UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nA number of countries around the world have responded to the call issued by the Rio+20 con-\nference, either by launching new policies and strategies for a green economy, or by intensif y-\ning their existing efforts. Thus, the concept of a green economy is increasingly gaining hold on \nthe groun d, through a number of concrete initiatives in various countries. An economically \nand geographically diverse group of countries \u2013 including, for example, Brazil, China, Costa \nRica, India, Korea, South Africa, Urug uay or Vietnam \u2013 is currently pursuing gree n economy \npolicies, building up a body of experience and evidence in the process.39 For example, India has \nbegun taxing energy from renewable sources at half of the rate of conventional sources and has set the goal of producing 20 GW of solar energy by 2020. Brazil has developed a \u201cNational Climate Plan\u201d which includes reducing annual deforestation by 80% by 2020 and is expected \nto overachieve its 2020 emissions reduction target. South Africa is reforming its tax system, \nincluding introducing a carbon tax and tax incentives for CDM and energy efficiency pr o-\njects.\n40  \nThis range of green economy policies and strategies at the national level is complemented by the efforts of UN bodies, who provide for information exchange, capacity building and other types of sup port for the national -level efforts. A central player in this respect is UNEP, which \nhad helped to establish the concept of a green economy in the first place. Its Green Economy Initiative (GEI), established in 2008, provides advisory services and research  for countries \nseeking to implement green economy measures. Building on this initiative and expanding it to \ninclude additional bodies, the Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE) was founded \nin 2013 by UNEP, UNIDO, UNITAR and ILO with the goal of supporting 30 countries in tran-sitioning to a GE as a demand -based, voluntary support mechanism. PAGE focuses on adv i-\nsory services, capacity building, and promoting cooperation and knowledge exchange. PAGE has begun activities in 17 countries and has request s for service and aid pledges from several \nothers.\n41  \nUNEP\u2019s efforts are based on a flexible working definition of the green economy as an economy that \u201cresults in improved human well -being and social equity, while significantly reducing \nenvironmental risks  and ecological scarcities. In its simplest expression, a green economy can \nbe thought of as one which is low carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive.\u201d\n42 Thus, \nUNEP\u2019s approach identifies some critical issues that should have a place in a country\u2019s  strat-\negy for achieving a green economy, yet it does not seek to impose concrete measures, a p-\nproaches or targets in the countries it assists.  \nThus, the resulting situation is a bottom -up process, driven by a growing number of countries \nthat each seek s their own pathway towards a green economy. UNEP and other UN bodies, but \nalso other organisations like the OECD act as information hubs in this process, providing for exchange and a loose coordination of different countries\u2019 efforts. National- level experiences  are \nundoubtedly needed: innovative solutions for how to implement a green economy will have to \ncome from the countries pursuing them. And while international institutions such as UNEP or \nthe OECD can offer valuable support in the process of sharing knowle dge and best practices, \nthe green economy will not be brought about through top- down recommendations from such \ninstitutions.  \n39 Samans, \u201cGreen Growth and the Post -2015 Development Agenda: An Issue Paper for the United Nations High -\nLevel Panel of Eminent Persons,\u201d 5.  \n40 The Green Growth Group, \u201cGoing for Green Growth: The Case for Ambitious and Immediate EU Low Carbon \nAction,\u201d 31 \u201333. \n41 Poschen, \u201cPAGE: Partnership for Action on Green Economy.\u201d  \n42 UNEP, Towards a Green Economy . p.16 \n24 UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \n3.3 Constituting elements and essential features of a green economy  \nAs noted, there is no exact definition of what constitutes a green  economy \u2013 except that the \nconcept will take on a different meaning in different places and circumstances. There is a \nworking definition put forward by UNEP, which is not very specific, but which provides a sense of direction, and is widely accepted.  \nIt is important to realise that policy and politics are full of terms and concepts that have \ngained considerable political traction, and have made profound impacts, without there being a \nclear definition, nor an agreement about what exactly they entail. For ins tance, there is no \nuniversally accepted definition of \u201csocial justice\u201d, neither is there one of \u201cdemocracy\u201d. Despite \nthis ambiguity \u2013  or perhaps even because of it \u2013 these terms have inspired billions, triggered \nsocial movements, and have thereby had consi derable impact. Thus, in a favourable sense, the \ngreen economy can be seen as a comprehensive tool to promote sustainable development, which leaves room for the negotiation of a consensual agenda.\n43 \nYet, while a concrete definition may be dispensable, it is  important that the normative content \nof a concept is clear: which vision of the future does it convey? What is the boundary of the concept, and in particular: which patterns, which developments or which activities are not compatible with it? Unless some k ind of understanding of this normative content emerges, the \nobvious risk is that the concept is perceived as arbitrary or random \u2013  a criticism that has often \nbeen voiced in relation to the concept of \u201csustainable development\u201d. In the case of the green economy concept, there is the risk that idea would be seen as \u201cjust another buzzword\u201d, thus \nfailing to inspire \u2013  or, worse still, that it comes to be seen (and rejected) as an incident of \n\u201cgreenwashing\u201d, whereby unsustainable practices are merely labelled as \u201c green\u201d.  \nAs such, the lack of a common and agreed definition need not be a major problem. What is \nmore important is that the content of the concept is clear \u2013  in the sense of a narrative or over-\narching paradigm, which captures the essential features of a green economy. Such a narrative \nis crucial, as it provides the common conceptual framework for the different policies and i n-\nstruments that are put in place to bring about a green economy. Showing how the various green economy policies relate to a common narr ative will enhance their political credibility, \nand underline the long -term commitment of the regulator \u2013  which, in turn, is necessary to \nstimulate private investment and mobilise stakeholder support.\n44 \nThis narrative, however, will not be established throu gh negotiations , but rather  through \npractical work on a green economy in different places, and through international exchange \nabout this work. At the same time, there are some constituting elements and essential fe a-\ntures of the green economy concept that can be inferred from the political and academic di s-\ncussions and negotiations:  \n\u25b8 The concept of a green economy represents a new model of economic development . The \nlimitations of the existing paradigm of economic growth and development are becoming \never more visible and tangible (economic crisis and instability, growing income inequa l-\nity, environmental degradation, dissatisfaction and unrest). Over the last two decades, several world regions have achieved rapid and continuous economic growth. This \ngrowth has l ifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and enabled the emergence of a \nnew global middle class. But it also presents a new set of challenges. For instance, in \nmany countries, the benefits of growth have been distributed unequally, with most \nbenefits accr uing within a small segment of the population. Increasing inequality in \n43 Poppe et al., \u201cIs Something Wrong with the Green Economy?,\u201d 12.  \n44 Mangalagiu, Meissner, and Jaeger, Towards a \u201cgreen Growth\u201d Compelling Narra tive. \n 25 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nthe distribution of incomes and wealth can be observed in developing and industriali s-\ning countries alike; often as a result of economic policies for which the need to adjust to \neconomi c globalisation is invoked as justification. Therefore, in developing and devel-\noped countries alike, the challenge is to make sure that economic growth is inclusive, i.e. that incomes rise across all segments of population. Also, the rapid economic growth in many parts of the world has coincided with an equally rapid growth in the \nconsumption of energy, natural resources and other material inputs. The increasing re-source use has a severe impact on the environment, and associated impacts on human health and well- being. As a consequence, economic growth (measured as growth in i n-\ncomes) does not result in a corresponding improvement in welfare, when the cost of the side- effects of growth are accounted for, such as environmental degradation and the a s-\nsociated imp acts on human health.  \n\u25b8 The concept of a green economy must be defined in relation to the most pressing global \ntrends and challenges. Thus, it needs to acknowledge the changed circumstances after \ntwo decades of economic globalisation, including the rise of a  global middle class. And it \nneeds to take up the global challenges that the world is facing \u2013 above all climate \nchange and the loss of biodiversity \u2013 and promote a joint global response to these cha l-\nlenges. \n\u25b8 The concept of a green economy needs to be based  on a holistic approach: it is esse n-\ntially about greening the entire economy , not about fostering a particular \u201cgreen\u201d se c-\ntor. Nonetheless, there are of course certain sectors that are of particular importance for the transformation to a green economy. Thi s includes, above all, carbon- and r e-\nsource -intensive sectors, such as the energy sector, mining, resource -intensive industry \nand manufacturing, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and transport.\n45 Responses for \nthese sectors will certainly include technological innovations that improve their energy - \nand resource -efficiency. But it will also include social and organisational innovations \u2013 \nfinding entirely new ways of satisfying demands. This will ultimately also result in a structural change, where economic we lfare is less and less connected to the extraction, \nprocessing and use of natural resources, and instead increasingly relies on smart se r-\nvices. This includes a re -allocation of capital and investment between sectors, a change \nin the demand for certain goods and services, and, accordingly, a change in prices and thus the profitability of existing investments. This will elicit resistance from those firms who have invested into the current pattern of resource -intensive economic \ngrowth, and expect to see a retu rn on these investments.  \n\u25b8 Correspondingly, as the transformation for a green economy will need to affect a broad range of sectors, \nsustainability concerns need to be mainstreamed into all policies  to \nbring about the necessary institutional and structural change. This also suggests that there will not be any singular policy instrument to direct the transformation, but rather a broad policy mix, consisting of new policies as well as reform of existing ones. In terms of the policy mix that countries can employ to support the transformation to a green economy, it is understood that economic instruments will have a key role to play. Economic developments are driven by prices. If prices do not reflect the full social and environmental costs, the economic incentives  that guide economic development are not \n45 African Development Bank, Sierra Leone: Transitioning Towards Green Growth. Stocktaking and the Way Fo r-\nward , 32. \n26 UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nin line with the environmental and social limits that the economy needs to reflect. \nChanging prices through the use of economic instruments is therefore a key part of the \npolicy instrument mix: if this is not achiev ed, it will always remain necessary to reg u-\nlate against the market dynamic. That said, it is also widely recognised that while ec o-\nnomic instruments may be necessary to change the direction of economic development \nto a green economy, they are not sufficient . Economic instruments have their limit a-\ntions, and therefore need to be supplemented by complementary policies, including R&D support as well as command -and-control regulation.\n46 \n\u25b8 A green economy will require some amount of reform to the institutional framew orks at \nnational and international level . In particular, the transformation to a green economy \nimplies a need for reform of the set or rules and institutions that currently shape the \nprocess of economic development, be it in the area of trade, finance or i nvestment.47 \nThis should also take into account the sets of targets that are intended to guide human \ndevelopment, such as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Millennium Devel-\nopment Goals (MDGs), as well as their interactions with the concept of a green  econ-\nomy. Prima facie, there would also seem to be much overlap between the green econ-\nomy concept and the ongoing efforts to arrive at new and better measures of progress \nand economic welfare \u2013 i.e. moving beyond GDP.  \n\u25b8 A green economy will still be a growi ng and thriving economy, lead by innovations, and \ndriven by increases in efficiency and productivity . But it is imperative that this deve l-\nopment changes into a direction that is commensurate with the limits set by the natu-\nral environment. This necessarily requires that the generation of economic welfare be \ndecoupled from the consumption of natural resources. At the same time, economic \ngrowth needs to be inclusive and enabling \u2013  making sure that the benefits of economic \ndevelopment are shared by all segments  of society.  \n3.4 Different interpretations of the green economy concept  \nWhile there is no universally agreed definition of a green economy, the work of UNEP over the \nlast years has done a lot to shape a common understanding of a green economy. Based on the \nworking definition referred to above, and through a number of publications, workshops and \nconferences, most notably the 2011 Green Economy Report,48 UNEP has facilitated the inte r-\nnational exchange on the green economy, and in the process helped to develop a co mmon u n-\nderstanding of the concept.  \nYet, it is also clear \u2013  and acknowledged in UNEP\u2019s work \u2013  that the concept of a green economy \nwill take a different shape in different places, recognising the various national priorities, specificities, starting points a nd capabilities. Countries around the world therefore follow di f-\nferent visions, models or approaches in pursuing sustainable development. This also entails a \nrange of different interpretations of the green economy concept \u2013  in some cases endorsing or \nre-interpreting the concept, in other cases following alternative approaches. Thus, in the EU, \nthe concept of a green economy largely overlaps with, and is influenced by, the aspirations to \nestablish a low -carbon economy by mid- century, whereas China emphasises  the concept of an \necological civilization as the Chinese implementation of a green economy. At the same time, \n46 International Labour Organization and UNEP, Working towards Sustainable Development: Opportunities for \nDecent Work and Social Inclusion in a Green Economy , 164.  \n47 Poppe et al., \u201cIs Something Wrong with the Green Economy?,\u201d 12.  \n48 UNEP, Towards a Green Economy . \n 27 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nthe OECD and other institutions emphasise the role of green growth, as yet another notion \nthat overlaps with the concept of a green economy. Bolivia, supported by other Latin American \ncountries, advocates the concept of Living Well in Harmony with Mother Earth as their ideal of development \u2013 a concept that has overlaps with green economy efforts in some respects, but \nis fundamentally opposed in oth er respects. These national and regional concepts represent \nparticular interpretations that may bear more or less resemblance to the concept of a green economy as proposed by UNEP. They overlap to a different degree, but not all of them are m u-\ntually compatible. A particular difficulty stems from the fact that the concepts themselves are \nnot necessarily clearly defined, but are to some degree expressions of a particular normative \napproach, which needs to be understood in the cultural and social context from which it em a-\nnated. Also for this reason, none of the different interpretations would appear suitable to fun c-\ntion as a universal blueprint for a green economy, which would be directly applicable to cou n-\ntries around the world.  \nChina\u2019s approach to sustainabl e development is summarised under the term Ecological Civil i-\nzation . The concept itself was developed in the 1990s. It suggests a strong transformative ori-\nentation: after the limitations of the current, industrial civilisation have become apparent, the \necological civilisation should mark the next stage in the development of the Chinese society \nand economy, and help China to reduce the high ecological cost of the past economic growth. Philosophically, the concept builds on the idea of the harmony of heaven an d man that is \nfirmly rooted in Chinese traditional culture. It aims to promote a harmonious and sustainable development between human beings, economy, society and nature.\n49 It became anchored as a \npolitical concept at the 17th national congress of the commu nist party in 2007. In terms of \npractical application, the concept centres on a mainstreaming approach of integrating ecolog i-\ncal requirements into other policies: it added the ecological dimension as a fifth dimension to the existing set of development tar gets (economic development, political development, cultural \ndevelopment and social development).\n50 \nThailand advocates the notion of a Sufficiency Economy , which is based on three pillars: mo d-\neration, reasonableness and resilience. Moderation relates to the need for a balanced develo p-\nment between material and non -material advancement, or between a rural and urban society. \nReasonableness relates to the quality of analytical work and decision -making, whereas resi l-\nience expresses the ability to manage economic, social and environmental risks. His Majesty \nKing Bhumibol first formulated the concept, partly in response to the 1997 economic crisis. \nThe eleventh National Economic and Social Development Plan (2012 -2016) aims to integrate \nthe concept of a sufficiency ec onomy with the notion of a Green Economy, recognising the ove r-\nlaps and the compatibility between both approaches.51 \nThe concept of Living Well in Harmony with Mother Earth  (Vivir Bien) represents a som e-\nwhat different approach, in that it has been put forwar d as an explicit opposition to the green \neconomy concept, rather than an alternative interpretation of it.

Rather, it emphasises the cultural and intrinsic value of n a-\nture, which cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and which must not be traded  off against \nmonetary values. It is framed as an alternative model to capitalism and modernity, and i n-\nstead emphasises ethical values to promote a holistic, humanistic, solidarity -oriented and \ncommunity based way of living.53 The notion of a green economy is viewed sceptically: it is \nassociated with the monetisation and commodification of nature, which is incompatible with \nthe absolute rights of Mother Earth, which must be protected and expanded and cannot be \ntraded off. The concept of Vivir Bien was endorsed in particular by Bolivia, supported by Venezuela and Ecuador. Based on these consider ations, Bolivia in particular asserted that no \nsingle model of economic  development \u2013 whatever its colour \u2013 should be imposed globally.\n54 \nThe concept of Green Growth  is rooted in the response to the 2007 -08 financial and economic \ncrisis, and the attempts of different countries to re -invigorate their economies with conside r-\nable stimulus packages. Yet the concept entails more than short- term crisis response, but \nrather aim s to show how economic reform and growth -enhancing policies can lead to a green-\ning of the economy. The Republic of Korea in particular has been a frontrunner in this respect, \nwith the establishment of a Presidential Commission on Green Growth in 2009 and t he ado p-\ntion of a National Strategy for Green Growth for 2009 \u20132013. The concept of Green Growth has \nbeen picked up and endorsed by different organisations, among them key international inst i-\ntutions like the OECD or the World Bank. As each of these instituti ons has put forward its \nown definition of green growth, there is no shortage of interpretations of the concept. Thus, \nthe OECD describes green growth policies as \u201cfostering economic growth and development, \nwhile ensuring that natural assets continue to pro vide the resources and environmental ser-\nvices on which our well- being relies\u201d55 \u2013 which, as observers have noted, is conceptually close \nto the understanding of sustainable development that underlies the sustainable development strategies of EU Member States .\n56 The World Bank understands green growth as \u201cgrowth that \nis efficient in its use of natural resources, clean in that it minimizes pollution and environ-\nmental impacts, and resilient in that it accounts for natural hazards and the role of enviro n-\nmental management and natural capital in preventing physical disasters\u201d.57 Other instit u-\ntions, such as UNESCAP or GGGI, define green growth with an explicit reference to climate policy (low -carbon development or climatic sustainability). While the notion of green growth in \nan abstract sense might still find wider support, the concrete interpretation is less likely to meet with universal agreement. For instance, the emphasis on natural assets and the services they provide is likely to be rejected by advocates of the Vivir -Bien approach as a commodifica-\ntion of nature, subordinating the Rights of Mother Earth to the market. Likewise, the strong role of market -based instruments which the OECD advocates as part of green growth policies \nis also likely to find the disagreemen t of many countries \u2013 not least because these instr u-\nments, at least in theory, require a framework of liberalised markets to deliver their full ec o-\nnomic efficiency.\n58 \nIn addition to these \u2013 more or less formalised and more or less official \u2013 definitions of a green \neconomy, several research and civil society organizations have also put forth different con-\n53 UNEP, South -South Cooperation: Sha ring National Pathways Towards Inclusive Green Economies . \n54 International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), Earth Negotiations Bulletin UNCSD #1, 46. \n55 OECD, Towards green growth , 9. \n56 Droege and Simon, \u201cThe Green Economy: An Economic Concept for Everyone?,\u201d 23.  \n57 Fay and Banque mondiale, Inclusive Green Growth the Pathway to Sustainable Development. , 2. \n58 Poppe et al., \u201cIs Something Wrong with the Green Economy?,\u201d 13.  \n29 UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \ncepts, frameworks, and strategies of green economy, many of which conflict with or contradict \neach other.59 \n4 Inclusive green economy: an engine for development?  \nSupported by various studies, governments, civil society, business and other players claim \nthat a green economy could deliver numerous benefits: a green economy improves resource efficiency, reduces pressures on the environment, creates good (or decent) jobs and helps r e-\nduce poverty. This section discusses in brief these benefits but also potential trade -offs. The \nsection is organised along these questions: Does a green economy generate jobs, help combat poverty, spur innovation and promote international trade? Does a green economy save ec o-\nnomic costs for society as a whole, through, for example, reduced dependency from energy i m-\nports and reduced health costs?  \n4.1 Opportunities for green and decent employment: job creation potential of \na green economy  \nIn Europe, eco -industries provide about 1 -2% of total employment, more than defence and \naerospace combined. This does not include all jobs that could be considered \u2018green jobs\u2019 but \nonly those in the environmental goods and services sector (EGSS).60 Projections  for the EU \nestimate that energy efficiency implementation could account for 2 million jobs by 2020, the \nrenewable energy sector could reach 3 million jobs by 2020, and the implementation of the \nrevised energy taxation directive could lead to cumulative 1 million new jobs by 2020. These \nwould be jobs at low -, middle -, and high- skill levels.61 Jobs currently indirectly provided by the \necosystems services sector in the EU are estimated at 14.6 million.62  \nA green economy is not only expected to create jobs in d eveloped countries but also in develop-\ning countries. UNEP estimates that net employment gains are likely to be largest in develo p-\ning countries because they can leapfrog to the technological level of developed countries. They also avoid costs of replacing obsolete infrastructure and associated employment friction.\n63 Job \ngrowth in the global renewables sector is already 21% annually.64 \nAt the same time, while there are good reasons to assume that the transformation to a green economy will result in net job crea tion, this does not mean that the transition will be smooth \nsailing all the way. Thus, some industries  that are relevant for a green economy , in particular \nthe solar PV industry , have recently seen job losses  after years of continuous growth. Solar \nindustr ies in Germany, for example, lost 21% of their jobs between 2011 and 2012 alone \u2013  \nabove all in the manufacturing of PV modules, whereas other segments like the installation and maintenance have been less affected.\n65 The decline in solar PV jobs has paused f or the \ntime being the overall growth in employment in the renewable energy sector in Germany, \nwhich has marginally declined from 2011 to 2012 after growing for years.  China, another front \nrunner, has also seen job losses due to recent trade disputes and de clines in demand.66  \n59 Benson and Greenfield, \u201cSurveying the \u2018green Economy\u2019 and \u2018green   Growth\u2019 Landscapes,\u201d 2.  \n60 European Commission, \u201cCom munication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the \nEuropean Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Towards a Job -Rich Recovery,\u201d 5.  \n61 Ibid., 7.  \n62 Ibid., 9.  \n63 International Labour Organization and UNEP, Working towards Sustainable Development: Opportunities for \nDecent Work and Social I nclusion in a Green Economy , viii.  \n64 Ibid., vii.  \n65 O\u2019Sullivan et al., Bruttobesc haeftigung durch Erneue rbare Energien in Deutschland i m Jahr 2012 . \n66 Wharton School of Business, \u201cWhy Is the Sun Setting on China\u2019s Solar Power Industry?\u201d   \n 30 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nThis seems contradictory. Several studies expect large increases in employment, in particular \nin developing countries, while recent news from the solar industry in Germany in particular \nseems to suggest the opposite. This seeming contradiction can be explained by the fact that \nglobally, an excess capacity for the manufacturing of PV modules had been building up. As the \nPV module industry has matured, it has also been undergoing a phase of consolidation and \nrationalisation. This, however,  does not change the long -term outlook for the industry, which \nkeeps reporting new record levels each year in terms of new capacity deployment.  \nA range of factors has to be taken into account for the determination of \u201cgreen jobs\u201d:  \n\u2022Terminology:  There are di fferent definitions of the term \u201cgreen job\u201d. According to th e\nI\nLO/IILS, \u201cgreen jobs are those jobs maintained or created in the transition process t o-\nwards a green economy that are either provided by low -carbon intensive industries (en-\nterprises) or by indus tries (enterprises) whose primary output function is to greening\neconomy [sic]\u201d .67 This is a circular definition. A more convincing definition lists sectors\nthat are essential for the transformation towards a green economy, such as energy, w a-\nter, and air quality to name a few particularly relevant sectors, but even such defin i-\ntions face significant terminology challenges, largely because it is difficult to delimit\nthese sectors. It is also a challenge to count jobs that overlap into different categories,such as a plumber who installs both solar panels and bath tubs. Depending on the def i-\nnition of the term \u201cgreen job\u201d, studies can arrive at different results.\n\u2022Net vs. gross effects:  It makes a difference if the focus is on estimating the number of\n\u201cgreen jobs\u201d (however defined) or if the focus is on estimating the net effects of env i-\nronmental policies. The latter also include job losses, either because \u201cgreen jobs\u201d re-place other jobs, or because environmental policies increase costs for some industries,leadin g to job losses in these sectors.\n68 Both of these measures have their merits an d\np\nrovide useful information; arguably the net effects are more relevant when it comes to\nevaluating the overall employment performance of a green economy.\n\u2022Causality:  There are similar problems with causality. Many factors are relevant for\ncreating employment. Feed -in-tariffs, for example, are generally credited as a measure\nparticularly successful in greening the power sector and the economy,  but interest rates\nare also an impor tant factor for the expansion of renewable energies. This leads to the\nquestion of w hich factor has actually created the job \u2013 the policy measure (feed -in-\ntariff) or the macroeconomic factor (interest rate) ?\n\u2022Country specific:  Job creation potential depend s on many factors and is always country\nspecific.69 Different green investments have different job creation potentials in different\ncountries: for example, biomass spending in China is taken to be nearly 30 times moreeffective in generating jobs per dollar  spent than wind power.\n70 In the US, solar PV\ncreates the most jobs per electricity unit output, and in Honduras water infrastructuremanagement ha s a m uch higher job creation factor than hydropower.\n71 An ILO study\nfound that a lack of policy coordination an d coherence in several countries led to job\n67 International Labour Organisation, \u201cDefining \u2018green\u2019: Issues and Considerations,\u201d 22. . \n68 Bundesministerium fuer Umwelt, Naturschutz und Rea ktorsicherheit and Umweltbundesamt, Report on the \nEnvironmental Economy 2011.

Often green econ-\nomy policies were just added to the existing policy spectrum without reforming other \npolicy areas. Better mainstreaming and coordi nation  are therefore still needed.72  \n\u2022 Sector specific: Sectors that are particularly relevant for the green economy have de-\nveloped differently. The solar industry is suffering from excess capacity worldwide; in particular European manufacturers are experien cing a massive cris\nis. Other sectors of \nthe green economy, such as water and sanitation, are not undergoing such a crisis. In \nthe United States, building renovation remains at stably high levels since recovery \nfrom the economic crisis has begun,  as renovation is seen as a safe and cost -effective \ninvestment rega rdless of the economic environment . This marks a departure from hi s-\ntorical patterns, where renovation levels have tended to fall as economic upswings b e-\ngin.73 The total val ue of the organic agri culture market has grown steadily worldwide \nshowing no evidence of the crisis.74 The market for car -sharing has also grown steadily, \nwith membership in North America growing at a steadily increasing rate over the past decade.\n75 Car sales between 2006 and 2009 in Europe tended over time towards smaller \ncars,76 and increases in demand for high- fuel efficiency cars correlate with poor eco-\nnomic performance, especially since 2007.77 \nThe employment effects of the Green Economy will not be a linear upward development,  but \nlike employment in general, will still be subject to periodic ups and downs. Despite these u n-\ncertainties, there are a few conclusions that appear fairly well established: Building a green \neconomy entails \u2013  inevitably \u2013 deep structural reform of many s ectors, such as the energy se c-\ntor, industries, transport or agriculture. Depending on the adaptation capacities of these se c-\ntors, this can lead to employment gains or losses in these sectors. Structural change increases demand for skills in growing industr ies. The ILO and UNEP report that a synthesis of studies \nfound a long -term net gain potential of 15 to 60 million jobs from a transition to a green econ-\nomy, a growth of 0.5 to 2%.\n78 Skills and knowledge used in existing industries will shift to \nmore sustain ably-focused modes of production (e.g. no -till agriculture, energy efficiency). The \nchange regarding energy efficiency  will probably have the largest effect on employment and \nskill demand.79 \u201cThe renewable energy and low carbon sectors generate more jobs pe r unit of \nenergy delivered than the fossil fuel- based sector\u201d.80 Renewables are more labour -intensive \nthan conventional energy, especially at the construction, manufacturing and installation stage (though less so in operation and maintenance, partly because  fuel input management is not \nnecessary).\n81 Additionally, for those countries that rely on fuel imports, renewable energy as a \ndomestic energy source will \u2013  at least partly \u2013  replace fossil fuel imports, thus keeping value \nadded within the country.82 \n72 International Labour Organisation, \u201cAre \u2018green\u2019 Jobs  Decent?\u201d.  \n73 Jackson and Feld, \u201cCompanies Forego New Buildings for Renovations: EcoPulse.\u201d  \n74 Arbenz, \u201cGlobal Market Outlook: The World of Organic Agriculture, Statistics and Emerging Trends,\u201d 7.  \n75 Shaheen, Innovative Mobility Carsharing Outlook: Carsharing Market Overview, Analysis, and Trends - Sum-\nmer 2013 . \n76 European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association, \u201cTrends in New Car Characteristics.\u201d  \n77 European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association, \u201cThe D rive towards Fuel Efficiency.\u201d  \n78 International Labour Organization and UNEP, Working towards Sustainable Development: Opportunities for \nDecen t Work and Social Inclusion in a Green Economy , viii.  \n79 Bowen, \u201cGreen\u201d Growth, \u201cGreen\u201d Jobs and Labor Markets . \n80 Ibid.  \n81 Ibid., 14.  \n82 Bundesministerium fuer Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit and Umweltbundesamt, Report on the \nEnvironmental Economy 2011.

This has various \nhealth benefits. For example, respiratory and cardiovascular disease/death from air pollution \nor water borne disease from pollution would b e reduced. Mitigated climate change would have \nenormous health benefits. Climate change is likely to affect the health of millions through in-\ncreases in malnutrition, or increases in disease and injury due to extreme weather events.83 In \ntotal, the WHO estimates that global climate change, air pollution, lead exposure, indoor \nsmoke from solid fuels and unsafe water combined account for nearly 10% of deaths and di s-\nease burden globally and around one quarter of deaths and disease burden in children under 5 years.\n84 \n4.3 The economic case for tackling environmental pressures  \nThere is compelling scientific evidence that natural systems have \u2018tipping points\u2019 or biophys i-\ncal boundaries beyond which rapid and damaging change becomes irreversible.85 There is also \nabundant evi dence that environmental degradation comes at (high) economic costs. This has \nbeen calculated for climate change on many occasions. Inaction has been estimated to lead to \npermanent reductions in output of up to 10%  by 2100;86by 2200 the costs of damages fro m cli-\nmate change will have reached US$ 74 trillion (at 2000 prices).87 The Stern Review estimates \nthat by 2200 in a BAU scenario, consumption losses due to the impacts of climate change will be at least 5% and up to 20% -  this is contrasted with annual miti gation costs of 1% of GDP to \nstay within an atmospheric carbon concentration of 500 -550 ppm (the amount required to \navoid the most severe risks) if action is not further delayed.\n88The IEA W orld Energy Outlook \n2012 shows \u201cthat delaying action on climate change is a false economy. Investments of around \nUS$ 1.5 trillion are avoided in the period to 2020, but an additional US$ 5 trillion of inves t-\nments are required between 2020 and 2035\u201d to keep CO 2 levels below 450 ppm in the long \nterm (this level corresponds to the agreed upon 2 \u00b0 limit to temperature rise).89 In addition, \nestimates of the costs of climate action may be too high, as they do not take the savings from \nclimate mitigation into account.90  \nConcerning sanitatio n and water quality, the cost -benefit -ratio of investing can be up to 7:1 in \nemerging economies.91 UNEP has shown that \u201cthe restoration of ecosystems or ecosystem se r-\nvices following their degradation or collapse is generally more costly and time- consuming t han \npreventing degradation, if that is possible at all\u201d.92 Concerning a range of environmental poli-\ncies, the World Bank estimates that US$  900 billion to US$  1,700 billion of green investments \nin land, water, and energy could yield economic returns of aroun d US$  3 trillion per year or \n83 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \u201cContribution of Wor king Group II to the Fourth Assessment R e-\nport of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: Summary for Policy Makers,\u201d 12.  \n84 World Health Organization, Global health risks: mortality and burden of disease attributable to selected major \nrisks, Geneva, 2009, p. 23  \n85 OECD, OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050: The Consequences of Inaction , 26. \n86 Stern, The Economics of Cl imate Change . \n87 Jordan and Lenschow, \u201c Environmental Policy Integration: A State of the Art Review\u201d; European Environment \nAgency, Environmental Policy Integration in Europe - State of Play and an Evaluation Framework . \n88 Stern, The Economics of Climate Change . \n89 International Energy Agency, Redrawing the Energy-Climate Map , 116.  \n90 OECD, OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050: The Consequences of Inaction , 27. \n91 Ibid., 278.  \n92 UNEP, Ecosystems and Human Well -Being , 83. \n 33 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \neven US$  3.7 trillion with carbon at US$  30 per ton and a phase out of energy, agricultural, or \nwater subsidies.93 \nTrucost estimates that the total value of unpriced natural capital costs are US$ 7.3 trillion, or \nabout 13% of gl obal economic output in 2009 (in 2009 prices).94 The 100 regional economic a c-\ntivities with the highest environmental impacts are estimated to generate negative externa l-\nities of US$ 4.7 trillion. The most significant impacts come from GHG emissions, water us e, \nand land use. Coal power generation and agriculture generate particularly high negative ex-\nternalities, far exceeding profits generated in many regions. The extent to which these exte r-\nnal costs impact consumer and business costs throughout the supply chain depend on the r e-\ngion and sector, but the business risk from unaccounted for externalities is growing as impacts \nincrease globally. Especially as severe events such as droughts increase, the costs of environ-\nmental impacts of production and consumption are likely to be increasingly internalized through volatile and sudden price effects if these risks are not incorporated by enterprises into \nbusiness strategies.  \nAll of these examples can serve as evidence that there is a very fundamental market failure at \nwork: they show that, since prices have failed to convey the \u201cecological truth\u201d about the costs \nof exploiting ecological resources, too much investment has flown into the wrong uses. The \nreturn on these investments would be diminished considerably if the s ocial and environmental \ncosts were accounted for. This suggests that the funds could have been invested into better, \nmore productive uses \u2013  generating more welfare.  \nWhile these long term and general estimates make a compelling case for building a green \neconomy, they disguise the fact that short term costs might be high and that some sectors are \nbound to lose market shares or their business case altogether. If fossil fuels must stay in the \nground \u2013 as required to combat climate change successfully \u2013  the oil industry or coal mining \nare likely to suffer, even if CCS or other technologies should become economically viable. \nThose businesses that have invested into resource -intensive technologies may find that their \ninvestments turn into stranded assets. These interests in combination with real and perceived \nfears of \u2013  for example \u2013  losing economic growth make building a green economy a more diff i-\ncult undertaking than might be suggested by the overall and long term estimates of possible green economy benefits.  \n4.4 The link between environmental degradation and poverty  \nIt is well established that the poor tend to be at highest risk of negative impacts from climate \nchange.95 Low income communities and households cannot afford capital- intensive climate \nchange mitigation and  adaptation measures.96 They often live in high -risk areas, such as \ncoastal and river flood plains.97 In addition, climate change and environmental degradation \nhave a disproportionally high negative effect on populations that derive their livelihood from \nnatural resources, such as those working in fisheries, agriculture and forestry. 98 These also \ntend to be sectors with low income and low security.

Lower income countries \ntend to be more reliant on natural capital f or their income.100 Ecosystem and soil degradation \nas well as water pollution may undermine food production and the availability of clean water, \nthereby particularly impacting the livelihoods of the poor.101 There is also a case for protection \nof biodiversity as a tool to combat poverty. Biodiversity conservation\u2019s effect on poverty alle-\nviation, however, depends largely on how the conservation efforts are designed and carried \nout.102  \n4.5 Green economy to reduce the cost of resource imports and import d e-\npendency  \nDependencies on energy imports in developing countries vary considerably. While a number of \ndeveloping countries are energy exporters, there are various developing countries with high \nimport rates. Examples of poor countries with high energy import rates incl ude Morocco (95% \nof total energy use), Jamaica (85%), Namibia (80%), Panama (78%), Dominican Republic \n(77%), Armenia (64%), Kyrgyz Republic (59%), Senegal (52%), Cuba (52%), and Botswana \n(52%).103 It is noteworthy that numbers are not available for many othe r poor countries. Low \nenergy sovereignty come s with high bills for energy imports . Richer countries may be able to \nshoulder these bills \u2013 in 2011, the EU spent over US$ 500 billion or 3.3% of its GDP on energy \nimports .104 For the weaker economies in many developing countries, the import dependence \u2013  \nand therefore the effect of price changes, is amplified. Thus, the ODI found that a doubling of \noil prices would lead to GDP losses in many African countries, including some oil exporting \ncountries, due to higher energy import/consumption prices and/or declining terms of trade.105 \nThe IMF also found that a US$ 0.25 increase in fuel prices led to a 5.9% decrease in real \nhousehold incomes on average.106 \nEnergy costs put an even heftier  price on developing countries if energy is subsidized \u2013  as is \nthe case in many developing countries. Many MENA countries, for example, subsidize fossil fuels at rates over 50% of the price, and subsidization levels range to nearly 90% of the price. \nOther countries such as Argentina, Indonesia and India subsidize fossil fuels at rates around \n20% of the price.\n107 Electricity subsidies in South Saharan Africa total on average 1.7% of GDP \n- in some countries over 2% -  and effective tariffs only represented about  70% of cost -recovery \nbetween 2005 and 2009.108 In various developing countries, energy subsidies are much larger \nthan social spending \u2013  in Uzbekistan, for example, post -tax energy subsidies are about seven \ntimes higher than spending on education and healthc are combined, in Iran and Bangladesh \n99 Holyoak and Poplawski -Stephens, \u201cDiscussion Note: The Offset Scandals in the Effort Sharing Decision.\u201d  \n100 World Resources Institute, \u201cDistribution of Total Wealth by Income Group, 2000.\u201d  \n101 Howe et al., \u201cElucidating the Path ways between Climate Change, Ecosystem Services and Poverty Alleviation,\u201d \n105. \n102 Bille , Lapeyre, and Pirard, \u201cBiodiversity Conservation and Poverty Alleviation,\u201d 31.  \n103 World Bank, \u201cEnergy Imports, Net (% of Energy Use).\u201d  \n104 International Energy Agency, \" Impact of high oil prices on the economy\u201c.  \n105 Cantore, \u201cEnergy Price Shocks: Sweet and Sour Consequences for Developing Countries,\u201d 18 \u201321. \n106 Arze del Granado, Gillingham, and Coady, The Unequal Benefits of Fuel Subsidies: A Review of Evidence for \nDeveloping Countries , 8. \n107 International Energy Agency, \u201cFossil Fuel Consumption Subsidy Rates as a Proportion of the Full Cost of \nSupply, 2011.\u201d  \n108 International Monetary Fund, Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications , 15. \n 35 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nabout three times as high, in Algeria, Egypt, and Ecuador about twice as high.109 Absurdly, \nenergy subsidies lead to higher energy consumption, which in turn drains public budgets even \nfurther.  \n4.6 Green economy as a driver of innovation  \nGreen technology, i.e. technology designed to lessen environmental pressures, is among the \nmost innovative area, as indicated in the graph below.   \nFigure 1: Innovation in climate change mitigation technologies, c ompared to all sectors  \n \nSource: OECD, \u201cEnvironmental Policy and Technological Innovation (EPTI).\u201d  \nMarkets alone will not create a green ec onomy \u2013 in fact, today\u2019s environmental degradation is \na textbook example of market failure. For this reason, building a green economy requires a wide range of policies and measures. Similarly, innovation does not simply happen; it depends \non the right poli cy frameworks. For green innovation there are various examples where poli-\ncies and measures have helped to bring innovation to the market:  \n\u25b8 Environmental regulation:  There are various examples of environmental regulation \nthat induced innovation. Emission standards for cars are a well -known example.  \n\u25b8 Pricing:  Pricing resources can also foster green technological progress.

It is widely agreed, for example, tha t having a \nlegally binding renewables target at the EU level for all Member States has drastically \nstrengthened national action: Between 1995 \u2013  2000, when there was no regulatory \nframework in place, the share of renewable energy in the EU grew by only 1.9%  per \nyear, but grew by 4.5% between 2001 and 2010 when the indicative and voluntary tar-gets were adopted. With legally binding national targets (from 2009 onwards), the \ngrowth accelerated further.  \n\u25b8 Innovation programmes:  Denmark with its wind turbines and J apan with hybrid e n-\ngine and catalytic converter technologies are two examples of countries that embarked \nupon costly resource management and innovation programmes early, and then ben e-\nfited when other states and companies needed to license their proprietary  techno l-\nogy.111 \n4.7 Trade effects of a green economy  \nGreening the economy will have numerous effects on trade. UNEP has produced a comprehe n-\nsive report on the relationship between trade and green economy. According to this report, \n\u201csustainable production and trade can positively impact different elements of the supply chain and consequently make exports more competitive in international markets\u201d.\n112 More specif i-\ncally, UNEP estimates that sustainable farming methods can increase productivity and strengthen export ma rkets. Products with an environmentally friendly design often have be t-\nter market access and a competitive advantage in global markets. In line with these findings, \ntrade in environmental goods has constantly grown.\n113 \nAt this general level and in its generic  terminology, the case for the positive trade effects of a \ngreen economy is strong. However, even if dynamic and growing, trade in environmental goods, when compared for example with the value of global trade in materials and resources, \nremains a small fra ction of total merchandise trade.\n114 In addition, more thorny questions \narise if specific impacts on sectors are considered. Trade in fossil fuels, which accounts for \nlarge shares in global trade, is likely to suffer if the world economy becomes less dependent on \nfossil fuels. In the absence of cleaner alternatives, aviation is likely to lose market shares on short and medium distances, if transport emissions are reduced as required by meaningful \nclimate action. Such changes are likely to affect airlines as w ell as aircraft manufacturers. \nReducing trade -related emissions is another challenge for achieving more sustainable trade \nand mitigating climate change.  \nIn response to these challenges for specific sectors, the transition to a greener economy will \nnecessitate greater fuel efficiency, the use of renewable energy sources, and the development \nof new markets in carbon credits as stated by UNEP. However, while greater fuel efficiency \noften comes at negative costs and creates win -win situations, renewable energy  sources in the \ntransport sector raise difficult questions. B iofuels are still by far the most important source of \nrenewable energies in the transport sector , and in practical terms the only type of renewable \nenergy that can be traded internationally. Yet their impacts on the local environment and food \nsecurity remain  contentious .  \n111 UNEP, \u201cGreen Economy Briefing Paper: Innovation.\u201d  \n112 UNEP, \u201cGreen Economy and Trade: Conclusion.\u201d  \n113 Ibid.  \n114 http://unep.org/greeneconomy/Portals/88/GETReport/pdf/Chapitre%208%20Conclusion.pdf  \n 37 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \n5 Policies for a green economy  \nIrrespective of the exact interpretation of a green economy applied in any country, it will r e-\nquire a range of policy instruments to change the curre nt model of economic development and \nput economies on track to a green economy.115 Market -based policy instruments, such as taxes \nand tradable permit schemes, will have a key role to play in this process: to change the dire c-\ntion of economic development onto a more sustainable trajectory, it will be necessary to rely on \nmarkets, but it will be equally essential to correct their functioning where they fail. As such, \nmarkets can be extremely useful to stimulate innovation, to speed up the diffusion of new techno logies, and to engage private investors and innovators in the transformation process to \na green economy. In general, policies for a green economy are therefore well advised to build on the market dynamic and direct it into a sustainable direction, rather than to work against it. \n Yet, a few clarifications to this general statement are necessary: first, the fields where private \ngreen economy investments are called for will often touch upon services of general interest \u2013 \nsuch as electricity supply, water and sanitation, or waste management. For such services of \ngeneral interest, market forces will only lead to social welfare gains if they are effectively \nregulated. This requires strong regulatory and administrative structures, which cannot be \ntaken for granted  in many countries. Second, the emphasis on market forces should not be \nmisread as claiming that, in the interest of a green economy, all types of non -traded assets \nshould be marketed (as, for instance, with biodiversity offset mechanisms or payments for e co-\nsystem services). Such instruments can be useful in a given context, provided the right admi n-\nistrative conditions are in place, but they are not an end in itself.  \nAlso, it would be misleading to think that market -based instruments (pricing tools, such a s \ntaxes and cap -and-trade) by themselves could bring about the fundamental transformation \nthat is needed to achieve a green economy. This task will require a broad policy mix, combi n-\ning a number of different instruments. However, economic instruments shoul d be an indispe n-\nsable part of this policy mix: to change the direction of economic development, it is indispens a-\nble to get the prices right. Yet, it is also true that many of the success stories of environmental \nregulation in the past have been achieved by  command -and-control regulation. Since market -\nbased instruments are fewer in number and more recent, it comes as no surprise that there \nare also fewer success stories.  \nWhile there is a growing repository of information on the different policy instruments t hat can \nsupport the transition to a green economy,\n116 it needs to be kept in mind that the transferabi l-\nity of policy instruments, and of insights about the performance of policies, is limited. Policy \ninstruments originate in a particular economic, political,  legal and cultural setting, and their \nperformance depends on this setting. Transferring policies from one setting to another is diff i-\ncult: absent the political, legal and cultural framework, the policies may deliver different r e-\nsults; and deriving general  conclusions about the merits of different policy instruments can be \nmisleading. Therefore, it is equally necessary to consider what framework conditions need to \nbe in place for policies to function well. For instance, to exploit their full potential, mark et-\nbased tools require some amount of flexibility in the market environment in which they oper-\nate: if electricity prices are strictly regulated, a cap -and-trade scheme covering the power se c-\ntor will not yield the same efficiency gains as in a context of fr eely fluctuating prices. Another \ninsight is that market -based solutions require a solid regulatory framework to function well, \n115 UNEP, Measuring Progress towards an Inclusive Green Economy , 25. \n116 See also the \u201cGreen Economy Toolbox\u201d compiled by UNECE, http://www.unece.org /fileadmin/DAM/GET/# !, as well \nas part III of the UNEP Green Economy Report ( UNEP, Towards a Green Economy ), or OECD, Towards green \ngrowth . \n 38 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nincluding a good deal of command -and-control -type oversight, for instance when it comes to \nmonitoring, reporting and verifying em issions, or assuring market oversight for trades in \nemission permits.  \nKeeping these caveats in mind, the following sections spell out some of the generic findings \nthat can be drawn for green economy policies.  \n5.1 Getting  the prices right  \nAny environmental poli cy that works against the market is likely to fail. If price signals con-\nsistently direct all investment and consumption decisions in a direction that takes the econ-\nomy away from a green economy pathway, it becomes very difficult, if not infeasible, to reg u-\nlate against the market signals. Alas, the prices of commodities are far from conveying the \nsocial and ecological truth about the traded products. The external costs of production \u2013  i.e. \nthe social and environmental impacts that are associated with the min ing of resources, the \nmanufacturing, transport, use and disposal of products \u2013  are not fully reflected in their ma r-\nket prices. This leads to a massive market failure: under textbook conditions, markets would \nbe expected to maximise social welfare. However,  reality is far from the textbook ideal: The \nfailure to account for external costs means that natural resources, and the products that make \nuse of them, are traded too cheaply, because part of their costs are simply imposed onto others, \nincluding future ge nerations, in the form of environmental degradation.117 As previously men-\ntioned, the gap in the value of production and of externalities is estimated in the trillions of \nUS$.118 \nFor this reason, for any green economy policy, a key part of the effort is to \u201cget  the prices \nright\u201d by phasing out environmentally harmful subsidies and by introducing pricing mecha-nisms that factor the external costs into any economic decision -making. In terms of such pri c-\ning mechanisms, there are different policy options at their dis posal, including taxes and tra d-\nable permit schemes. If designed well, they can be both effective and efficient tools \u2013  and they \nhave the potential to generate revenue, which can then be used to ameliorate undesirable s o-\ncial side -effects, such as impacts on  particularly vulnerable parts of society. The observation \nthat a failure to include external costs reduces economic welfare, and that governments could increase welfare through a tax that internalises these costs, was put forward by the British \neconomist Arthur Cecil Pigou almost a century ago. Some progress has been made since, but a \nlot remains to be done.  \n5.1.1  Phasing out environmentally harmful subsidies  \nBefore thinking about new instruments to internalise the external costs of economic activity, it \nis wort h considering the effects of existing support mechanisms. Around the world, govern-\nments employ a range of support mechanisms, often at great expense to the public budget, which make it cheaper to indulge in emitting activities. That is, governments use pub lic funds \nto provide an incentive to pollute more, not less. As described in section 2.5 , the effect on the \npublic budget and the economy as a whole can be detrimental: a number of countries spend several percentage points of their GDP on subsidising fuels \u2013  often in excess of what they \nspend on public healthcare or on education. This leads to fiscal imbalances, crowds out other \npublic and private spending, a nd distorts investment incentives away from energy efficiency \nand low -carbon energy.\n119 \n117 UNEP, Driving a Green Economy Through Public Finance and Fiscal Policy Reform . \n118 Trucost, Natural Capital at Risk: The Top 100 Externalities of Bus iness . \n119 Clements, Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications . \n 39 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nDefining such environmentally harmful subsidies is not easy \u2013  as they are often not in the \nform of explicit subsidies out of public budgets, but rather support measures s uch as tax e x-\nemptions. Among the different types of environmentally harmful subsidies, subsidies to fossil \nfuels are best documented, particularly through the work of the International Energy Agency \n(IEA). The IEA applies the price -gap method to measure th e difference between the difference \nbetween the domestic price level for fossil fuels (which, in many countries, is guaranteed in \ndomestic legislation) and an international reference level for the same fuel. Using this method, \nthe IEA estimates that global  subsidies to fossil fuel amounted to US$  409 billion in 2010, or \nabout 0.5% of global GDP.120 And this merely accounts for the public money that governments \nuse to support fuel consumption. If one recognises that, from a public welfare perspective, fos-\nsil fuel consumption should be taxed to reflect the external costs they cause, the volume of \nsubsidies is much higher. According to IMF calculations, the foregone tax revenue due to the \nfailure to include external costs as well as VAT is about four times the size of the pre -tax su b-\nsidies, as measured in the price- gap approach, as applied by the IEA. Including the foregone \ntax revenue, total fossil fuel subsidies amounted to a staggering US$  1.9 trillion in 2011, or \nabout 2.5% of global GDP.121 \nDue to the method us ed, both the IEA and the IMF figures mostly apply to developing cou n-\ntries: while fossil fuel subsidies are also found in developed countries, the latter tend to subs i-\ndise the production of fossil fuels rather than their consumption, e.g. by supporting coal min-\ning. Where developed countries support energy consumption, it is mostly in the form of exem p-\ntions from existing energy taxes (or, in the case of tradable permit schemes, free allocation of allowances). And while developing countries typically invoke so cial considerations to justify \nthe existence of subsidies, governments in industrialised countries deem such support mea s-\nures necessary to protect the competitiveness of companies or to entire industries. Whether or not this claim is justified, whether the  support measures are targeted at the right companies \nand sectors, and whether they achieve what they are expected to, has been a matter of much debate.  \nRecognising the multiple problems associated with fossil fuels subsidies, the G20 agreed in \n2009 to pro gressively reduce \u201cinefficient energy subsidies\u201d, and eventually to phase them out \naltogether. However, little progress has been made to follow up on this agreement; in the two \nyears following the agreement, the G20 countries failed to even agree on a definition of what \nconstitutes \u201cinefficient energy subsidies\u201d, let alone concrete steps towards their phase -out.\n122  \nBut while fossil fuel subsidies often take centre stage in the discussion about environmentally \nharmful subsidies \u2013 partly because of their sheer  volume, and because they are relatively well-\ndocumented \u2013 they are only one subset of all environmentally harmful subsidies. The World \nBank estimates that, in addition to US$  455\u2013 485 billion of fossil fuel subsidies, there are \nUS$ 200 \u2013 300 billion of annual water subsidies, US$ 370 billion of transfers to agriculture, \nand US$ 10\u201330 billion for fisheries, bringing the total volume of environmentally harmful \nsubsidies to US$ 1\u2013 1.2 trillion each year.123 For instance, fisheries continue to receive subs i-\ndies th at encourage unsustainable capacity building and fishing methods: research indicates \nthat about 60% of fishery subsidies support unsustainable practices, and should therefore be seen as environmentally harmful subsidies.\n124 \n120 Internat ional Energy Agency, World Energy Outlook 2011 . \n121 Clements, Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications . \n122 Belschner and Westphal, The G20 and Inefficient Energy Subsidies . \n123 Fay and Banque mondiale, Inclusive Green Growth the Pat hway to Sustainable Development. , 9. \n124 Pew Environment Group, Subsidizin g Global Fisheries , 1. \n 40 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nThere is no shortage of convincing  arguments for phasing out environmentally harmful subs i-\ndies: the phase -out increases economic welfare, benefits the public budget, increases energy \nsecurity and reduces import dependency, promotes the functioning of energy markets, and of \ncourse reduces b oth CO 2 emissions and local (air) pollution. But despite all these arguments, \nthe politics of phasing out \u2013  or even reducing \u2013 environmentally harmful subsidies are ex-\ntremely difficult, if not risky. Subsidies to energy consumers are typically justified on  social \ngrounds: providing cheap access to energy is seen as instrumental to reduce poverty. However, \nthis ignores the fact that only a small share of the subsidies actually benefits the poorest \nhouseholds: according to the IEA, only 8% of the US$  409 bill ion in global annual fossil fuel \nsubsidies benefited the poorest 20% of the population. Most of the subsidies actually benefit \nthe middle class and the rich. Energy subsidies are, therefore, an extremely inefficient tool for \nassisting the poor.125 The same i s true for fishery subsidies: the environment, but also the l o-\ncal economy and coastal communities would benefit if fishing subsidies could be redirected to \nsupport sustainable management practices and resource conservation, or to boost other indu s-\ntries in fishing communities.126 \n5.1.2  Introducing new market -based instruments for pricing externalities  \nRecognising the efficiency and effectiveness of markets, countries around the world have in-\ncreasingly relied on markets as the basic mechanism to allocate capital and labour resources to their most productive use, resulting in high economic growth rates and booming global \ntrade. However, as the importance of markets around the world grows, so does the need to \ncorrect their failures when they occur. This includes the use  of market -based policy instr u-\nments, such as taxes or tradable permit schemes.  \nThe main benefit of market -based instruments is that they correct the price signals in an \neconomy, and thereby change the incentives that influence both the consumption decision s of \nprivate households and the investment decisions of businesses. In this way, market -based i n-\nstruments help to correct the functioning of markets, using their strengths as a discovery mechanism for new products and services.  \nWhile changing relative pri ces is arguably the main function of market -based instruments, the \ngeneration of revenue is another important aspect: both taxes and tradable permit schemes generate additional revenue for the public budget, which can be put to different uses. For in-stance , the OECD estimated that for industrialised countries alone, the revenue that they \ncould raise from taxes or from the auctioning of emission allowances to achieve their Copen-hagen pledges could amount to about US$ 250 billion, or 0.6% of their combined GD P.\n127 The \nEU found that if all EU member states raised environmental taxes to 10% of overall tax bill, \nthis would yield an additional 1.4% of EU GDP that could go towards supporting green econ-\nomy reforms (currently they make up about 6.3%).128 \nThis revenue can be used in different ways:  \n125 Internat ional Energy Agency, World Energy Outlook 2011 . \n126 Pew Environment Group, Subsidizing Global Fisheries , 4. \n127 UN Environment Management Group, Working towards a Balanced and Inclusive Green Economy: A United \nNations System-Wide Perspective , 15. \n128 European Commission, \u201cCommunication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the \nEuropean Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Towards a Job -Rich Recovery,\u201d 6.  \n 41 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \n\u25b8 It could be used to cut labour taxes, thereby stimulating employment. The ILO calc u-\nlated that imposing a tax on CO2 and using the revenue to cut labour taxes could cr e-\nate up to 14 million net new jobs.129  \n\u25b8 Alternatively, the revenue can be used to mitigate adverse impacts on particularly vu l-\nnerable groups, e.g. through lump -sum refunds to the poorest households. Such support \nmeasures at the household level can be targeted much better at those who need them \nand are, therefore, a much more efficient compensation tool than low prices for energy \nand resource -consuming activities.  \n\u25b8 The revenue can serve to fund other environmental measures, particularly those that \nprovide environmental benefits at low cost, but which are not implemen ted because of \nother non -market barriers. This can include a lack of awareness and information, \nwhich can be addressed through targeted campaigns and information provision, but also lacking access to finance. An example of the latter are subsidised loans f or energy \nefficiency improvements in private homes. Such measures are not only beneficial at the household level, they also provide a net saving for the economy as a whole: the IEA es-\ntimates that \u201cadditional investment of US$ 11.8 trillion in efficient end -use technol o-\ngies is more than offset by a US$  17.5 trillion reduction in fuel bills and a US$  5.9 tri l-\nlion cut to supply -side investment by 2035\u201d.\n130 \nEfforts to introduce market -based instruments, or to increase the level of ambition of existing \nones, are o ften hampered by the concern that this will undermine the international competi-\ntiveness of domestic industries. Such concerns can be alleviated through regional or global \ncooperation on environmental tax reform, investment, and regulation policies. 131 \n5.1.3  Refle cting the value of nature  \nThe approach championed by the initiative on The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity \n(TEEB) advocates true cost accounting to reflect the real value of ecosystems and biodiversity. \nActivities that involve the consumption or d estruction of natural assets must reflect the real \nvalue of these assets, including all positive and negative externalities. Otherwise, the cons e-\nquence is  wasteful destruction of assets. Building on the TEEB  methodology, a recent study \nidentifies several examples of economic activities in which the costs to society far exceed the \neconomic benefits.  The activities with the highest overall negative impact on natural capital \nare coal power generation in Eastern Asia and North America, cattl e ranching and farming in \nSouth America, and wheat and rice farming in Southern Asia.132 The combined costs to society \nof the 20 most environmentally harmful regional sectors are estimated to be over US$ 3 tri l-\nlion. These activities are only viable because t he profits are collected privately, while the costs \nare borne by the society (including future generations), meaning enterprises and sectors have  \nno incentives under current political economic conditions to pursue sustainable business strategies. But as su ch, the activity is entirely wasteful; society would be better off if the activ-\nity was simply stopped.  \n129 International Labour Organization and UNEP, Working  towards Sustainable Development: Opportunities for \nDecent Work and Social Inclusion in a Green Economy , x. \n130 International Energy Agency, \u201cWorld Energy Outlook 2012 Factsheet: How  Will Global Energy Markets Evolve \nto 2035?,\u201d 4.  \n131 International Labour Organization and UNEP, Working towards Sustainable Development: Opportunities for \nDecent Work and Social Inclusion in a Green Economy , 171.  \n132 Trucost, Natural Capital at Risk: The Top 100 Externalities of Business . \n 42 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nGovernments need to analyze overall economic risk of externalities and implement policies to \nefficiently internalize these costs to provide the correct economic incentives.133 However, this \napproach should not be confused with a call to create markets for anything and everything, \nand then leave it to the market to identify the best solutions . There are examples where this \napproach can work: c oncepts such as  payments for ecosystems services (PES) and programs \nsuch as REDD and greening measures in agricultural subsidies are existing attempts to inte-\ngrate true costs into the market via policy measures.  But it is also clear that markets require \na solid regulator y environment to function  well.  This applies e specially to politically created \nmarkets  such as PES or REDD: while there is a real and tangible benefit underlying the trade, \nthe rules of the market are entirely due to political decisions. To define these ru les in a non -\ndistorting and non- discriminatory way and to avoid regulatory capture requires a strong, i m-\npartial and independent administrator, and good market oversight \u2013  which cannot be taken \nfor granted in many countries . One alternative could be to recognise the economic value of \nnatural resource, but use command and control methods to protect resources in cases where \nthe revenue from production and the cost of environmental degradation are clearly out of bal-\nance, or where it would be prohibitively costly or simply infeasible to implement a market-\nbased solution.  \n5.2 Measure what matters \u2013  welfare indicators beyond GDP \nThe insight that the current model of economic development is not delivering socially optimal outcomes is closely linked to the way how we cur rently measure economic progress. Around \nthe world, the gross domestic product (GDP) is firmly established as the guiding indicator for economic development.  \nThe problem is not so much that there is something wrong with GDP as such. The problem is \nrather t hat GDP was conceived as a measure of economic \noutput . But it was never intended to \nserve as an indicator of the overall development  (or progress) of a society or a country, and the \nwelfare (or well -being) of the people that live in it.134 If it is used in t his sense, GDP is bound \nto deliver skewed results, as it simply does not account for many factors that are crucial for \nhuman well -being. To begin with, GDP will only count the aggregated incomes in an economy, \nbut it is entirely unaffected by how these inc omes are distributed. Environmental degradation \nand its costs are not reflected in GDP \u2013  but if money has to be spent to clean up the cons e-\nquences of environmental degradation, these expenses will actually increase GDP, and thus appear to be beneficial \u2013 where, in fact, people\u2019s lives would have been happier if the damage \nhad been avoided in the first place.  \nThe insight that GDP is a poor measure of human well -being is not a new one: the EU and the \nOECD have advocated for more than a decade that new welfare  indicators are needed that go \n\u201cbeyond GDP\u201d, in order to replace or supplement GDP. At the same time, GDP has proven to be very long -lived: it is widely used, it is relatively easy to calculate, and despite its limitations \neasy to communicate.  \nOne of the m ost influential voices that was raised in the discussion about better welfare ind i-\ncators beyond GDP was the Stiglitz -Sen-Fitoussi commission (officially the Commission on the \nMeasurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress), which submitted its fin al report \nin 2009, deriving twelve recommendations for developing better indicators of economic well -\nbeing and social progress. Among other things, they recommended that indicators for well -\nbeing should look at income and consumption rather than production , and emphasise the \n133 Ibid.  \n134 Stiglitz, Sen, and Fitoussi, Report by the Commission on the  Measurement of Economic Performance and Social \nProgress , 8. \n 43 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nhousehold perspective. In so doing, indicators should pay more attention to the distribution of \nincome, consumption and wealth, as key determinants of the quality of life. Income measures \nshould be expanded to reflect non -market activities. As regards quality of life, the commission \nemphasised the connection to people\u2019s objective conditions and capabilities, which suggests \nthat factors such as health, education, personal activities and environmental conditions have a \nrole for well- being,  as well as social connections, political voice, and insecurity that can be \nshown to predict life satisfaction. In this context, the commission recommended considering \nmeasures of both objective and subjective well -being to provide information about people\u2019s \nquality of life. The Stiglitz -Sen-Fitoussi Commission regarded the assessment of sustainability \nas a complementary task to the measurement of well -being. In particular, they found a need \nfor an indicator of our proximity to dangerous levels of environmental damage (tipping points, \ne.g. related to climate change or the depletion of fishing stocks). 135 \nAcknowledging the various limitations and shortcomings of GDP, and the need to have indica-\ntors that are able to measure a much broader concept of human well -being and the quality of \nlife, the next question is how to move from the existing GDP to a more complete indicator. In \nshort, the options are either to correct GDP \u2013 by subtracting or adding (in monetary form) \nthose components that it currently does not me asure; to substitute GDP with another (aggr e-\ngate) indicator of human well- being; or to complement GDP with other indicators, together \nforming a small set of core indicators for human well- being.136 \n\u25b8 An example of the first approach \u2013  adjusting GDP by subtract ing defensive social and \nenvironmental costs, and by adding factors such as unpaid labour (voluntary or hous e-\nwork) is the National Welfare Index that was recently developed for the case of Ger-\nmany, and that is being considered by other EU countries.137 In to tal, the NWI aggr e-\ngates 19 indicators to yield a monetary measure of national welfare. The NWI is based on private consumption, weighted by household income to account for inequality in the \nincome distribution. Added to this are household and voluntary wor k as well as public \nexpenditure on health care and education, whereas the cost of crime and traffic acci-dents, as well as the cost of environmental degradation, is subtracted.  \n\u25b8 With its \u201cBetter Life Index\u201d, the OECD has suggested a composite indicator that  aggre-\ngates 24 indicators across eleven topics, ranging from income to education and from en-\nvironment to life satisfaction. It is only marginally related to GDP \u2013  one of the indic a-\ntors for the topic \u201cincome\u201d is the household disposable income, which repres ents a part \nof GDP, and would tend to move in line with GDP changes. Consequently, the Better \nLife Index does not provide a monetary result. Interestingly, the OECD chose not to a s-\nsign weights to the different topics that make up the Better Life Index, but instead \nleave it to each user to assign his / her own weights.\n138 \n\u25b8 UNEP takes a different stance at this, advocating a set of indicators to replace GDP, rather than a composite index that would aggregate all different dimensions and as-\npects into a single num ber.\n139 UNEP argues that the best solution is a suite of indic a-\n135 Stiglitz, Sen, and Fitoussi, Report by the Commission on the  Measurement of Economic Performance and Social \nProgress . \n136 Philipp Schepelmann, Yanne Goossens, and Arttu Makipaa, Towards Sustainable Development: Alternatives to \nGDP for Measuring Progress . \n137 Zieschank and Diefenbacher, The National Welfare Index as a Contribution to the Debate on a More Sustain a-\nble Economy . \n138 http://www .oecdbetterlifeindex.org/  \n139 Stiglitz, Sen, and Fitoussi, Report by the Commission on the  Measurement of Economic Performance and  Social \nProgress , 23. \n 44 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \ntors with a subset of core or headline indicators that are applicable to all countries. \nThis would facilitate international comparison, but at the same time allow for high d e-\ngree of customisation  to individual country circumstances.140  \n\u25b8 In a similar fashion, the Stiglitz -Sen-Fitoussi Commission has argued for a dashboard \nof indicators to assess sustainability, rather than one single aggregate indicator. A monetary index would have its place in such a dashboard but should remain focused only on the economic aspects of sustainability. For other aspects of sustainability, they \nadvocated separate, non -monetary indicators as parts of the dashboard.  \nThese are just selected examples of some recent alternati ve measures of welfare: the history of \nalternative measures is as long as the criticism of GDP.\n141 One reason for the persistence of \nGDP as an indicator is that all of the alternative indicators have their own limitations: co m-\nposite indicators involve an agg regation of different dimensions, which requires the definition \nof weights for the different components. Approaches that correct GDP avoid this by expressing \nall factors in monetary terms \u2013 however, this requires that environmental and social costs are \nvalued in monetary terms, often using non -market valuation methods, as environmental goods \nand services are typically not traded on any market. This is possible, but also a time -\nconsuming and tedious task.142 Therefore, pragmatic arguments in favour of a dashbo ard a p-\nproach is that it avoids the problem of aggregating impacts across different dimensions, it o f-\nfers more flexibility for divergent national approaches, and it allows for all types of indicators.  \nThe Green Growth Knowledge Platform, a joint effort by UNEP, OECD, GGGI and the World \nBank, has started work towards a common approach for a set of green economy indicators, \nincluding the option of a green economy dashboard of indicators.143 Establishing such a \ndashboard would provide an opportunity to connect three processes that are laid out in the \noutcome document of the Rio+20 conference: the drive for a green economy, the establishment \nof sustainable development goals (and, eventually, indicators corresponding to these goals), \nand the call to develop broader  measures of progress to complement GDP. While these three \nprocesses differ in terms of their scope and level of detail, there are also obvious interlinkages. \nAlong these lines, UNEP argued that the existing set of sustainable development indicators as \nwell as MDGs should provide the basis for outcome indicators, through which the effectiveness of green economy policies could be measured.\n144 \n5.3 Industrial policies and investment support for a green economy  \nThe transformation to a green economy will inevitably involve some degree of structural change. The existing economic structures, in which wealth generation is still largely based on the extraction and processing of resources, have lead us to the difficult situation that we are \nfacing. To escape from this dea d-end, and to change onto a sustainable development trajectory, \nwill require a change of how and where value added is generated.  \nThis implies that green economy policies will promote growth in some sectors, but will dis-courage growth in others. Some sector s will be obvious winners of the transformation to a \ngreen economy \u2013  not only the renewable and energy efficiency technologies as well as water \n140 Ibid., 29.  \n141 For a more exhaustive discussion of the different alternative welfare measures and their respective merits and \ncriticisms, see e.g. Philipp Schepelmann, Yanne Goossens, and Arttu Makipaa, Towards Sustainable Develo p-\nment: Alternatives to GDP for Measuring Progress . \n142 Ibid., 51.  \n143 Green Growth Knowledge Platform, Moving towards a Common Approach on Green Growth Indicators . \n144 UNEP, Measuring Progress towards an I nclusive Green Economy , 19. \n 45 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nand waste management, but also many services, IT, telecommunications, (sustainable) tour-\nism, cultural and creati ve industries.145 For some sectors, there are challenges and opportun i-\nties \u2013 e.g. the energy sector, manufacturing, chemicals, transport, and construction, but also in \nagriculture, forestry and fishing.146 It will be up to each enterprise in these sectors to m ake \nthe most of the new opportunities. And there are a few subsectors for which the green eco n-\nomy presents a major challenge \u2013  in particular the fossil fuel industry (extraction, refining). \nThey may not disappear entirely, but will see the size of their ma rket diminish considerably. \nThe challenge in designing an industrial policy for the green economy will be to open up new \nperspectives for businesses operating in the latter category, for which there is only limited \nspace in a green economy. Just as importa ntly, industrial policies can assist companies in \nthose se ctors that are neither clear winners or clear losers to recognize and embrace the o p-\nportunities brought with the transition to a green economy.  \nTo manage the transformation to a green economy, one k ey challenge will be to mobilise the \nnecessary investments and guide them in the right direction, i.e. towards resource -efficient \ntechnologies. Using market -based instruments to change relative prices will help to make \n\u201cgreen investments\u201d more attractive ( see section 4.1). Beyond that, other tools for investment \nsupport will also be needed to create an environment that induces private investment, such as investment subsidies, long -term guarantees and risk -sharing arrangements. Revenue from \nmarket- based inst ruments \u2013 such as taxes and permit trading schemes \u2013 can help to provide \nthe funding for such measures.\n147 Lastly, the government also has an exemplary function: \nthrough public procurement, public work schemes and public- private partnerships, it directly \ncontrols a considerable share of investments, and can use this market power to build up the \nmarket for green economy technologies and services. It should be borne in mind that green economy technologies will often be new technologies, provided by new companie s that have to \ncompete with incumbents \u2013  even though the technologies may be more efficient, the incu m-\nbents will inevitably have a better starting position. By using their market power as consu m-\ners of goods and services, governments can support such novel technologies and allow them to \nmature sufficiently to become competitive with the established technologies.  \nApart from mobilising investments, the labour force represents another potential constraint: here, the transformation to a green economy will requir e some flexibility and mobility. Yet in \nabsolute terms, the challenge seems manageable: UNEP and the ILO estimate that, even in \nindustrialised countries, where the impact of the transformation on labour markets will be \nmost pronounced, only about one perce nt of the labour force will need to transfer between sec-\ntors. The transfers between companies are expected to be ten times larger.\n148 In a similar fas h-\nion, the OECD points out that the most polluting sectors in the OECD countries account for more than 80% of  emissions, but only for 8% of all employment.\n149 UNEP and the ILO ther e-\nfore conclude that the effects of the green economy transition would be small in comparison to \nthe effects that globalisation has had on the labour markets in recent decades. The social im-\npacts on the labour force can be mitigated through strengthened social protection and active \n145 UN Environment Management Group, Working towards a Balanced and Inclusive Green Economy: A United \nNations System-Wide Perspective , 13. \n146 International Labour Organization and UNEP, Working towards Sustainable Development: Opportunities for \nDecent Work and Social Inclusion in a Green Eco nomy , ix. \n147 Fisher, \u201cThe Private Sector\u2019s Role in Low Carbon Resilient Development.\u201d  \n148 International Labour Organization and UNEP, Working towards Sustainable Development: Opportunities for \nDecent Work and Social Inclusion in a Green Economy , viii.  \n149 OECD, Towards green growth , 90. \n 46 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nlabour market policies \u2013  and through dedicated training and education, as discussed in the \nfollowing. 150 \n5.4 Training and education  \nStructural policies for a green ec onomy are tightly linked to training and education. There are \ntwo dimensions to this process: for those sectors and companies where the move to a green \neconomy entails a fundamental change in business models and production processes, there is a \nneed for workplace training to acquire the necessary new skills. But as the green economy transition also entails structural change in the economy, there is also a need for skills deve l-\nopment and education policies to facilitate job transition between sectors.\n151 As ex plained in \nsection 2.1, the transition process to a green economy offers considerable potential to generate \nnew employment, but it also entails significant labour m arket restructuring: employment in \nsustainable sectors will grow, and employment in resource- intensive and polluting sectors will \ndecrease as the share of these sectors in the economy declines. Yet the labour force cannot \nsimply be shifted from the \u201cbrown\u201d to the \u201cgreen\u201d sectors and enterprises: to avoid skill gaps \nand to minimise transitional unemployment, adequate training and education measures are \nnecessary. The existence of an appropriately trained workforce with the capacity for further learning also inspires confidence in the success of a green economy transition, encouraging \nsustainable investment, innovation, job creation, and economic diversification.\n152 In relation to \nthe latter, the ILO strongly argues for monitoring of job quality and labour legis lation to en-\nsure that the green economy indeed creates high -quality, decent jobs, in order to be truly i n-\nclusive.  \nTo support the redeployment of the workforce from contracting to expanding sectors during the transition, the OECD argues for a three -legged s trategy to enable a smooth and just tran-\nsition .\n 153 This would include:  \n4. Skill development and active labour market policies to support the adaptive capacity of \nlabour markets ; \n5. Moderate employment protection and strong product market competition to promote employment growth in new green competitive niches;  and \n6. Flanking measures like unemployment benefits and in -work benefits to ensure that a \ndynamic labour market is not achieved at the cost of job insecurity or inequality.  \nSo far, compulsory and tertiary education s have been catching up to changing needs rather \nwell, but technical and vocational education and training have not been adapting efficiently.\n154 \nEvidence suggests that sk ills gaps already exist in many countries for green jobs, especially in \nsustainable construction and retrofitting, environmental services , renewable energy, and e n-\nergy and resource efficiency. Training is needed to develop new skills or new combinations of  \nfamiliar skills.155  \n150 International Labour Organization and UNEP, Work ing towards Sustainable Development: Opportunities for \nDecent Work and Social Inclusion in a Green Economy , ix\u2013xii. \n151 Ibid.  \n152 Strietska -Ilina et al., Skills for Green Jobs: A Global View . \n153 OECD, Towards green growth , 95. \n154 Strietska -Ilina et al., Skills for Green Jobs: A Global View . \n155 OECD, Towards green growth . \n 47 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nCurricula standards and training programs (for vocational, higher education, and on -the-job \nenterprise training) need to be established for new green jobs and sectors.156 The literature \nincludes emphasis on not just technical skills but a lso developing \u201ccore portable skills\u201d, such \nas leadership, resource efficient management, environmental awareness, team work, and sy s-\ntemic thinking. These are useful in both green and brown sectors, making them crucial esp e-\ncially in transition periods and sectors.157 These skills are also important for policy - and deci-\nsion-makers. 158 \nReliable information about employment and skill needs help identify areas where training \nfocus should be put.159 There is currently no standard approach to identify and monitor gree n \noccupations and related skills; establishing rigorous standards could give sectors and policy -\nmakers a more reliable and effective tool to inform decisions.160 Many developed countries a l-\nready have sophisticated data collection and monitoring systems for labour markets. Where \nmechanisms to assess employment needs exist, these can inform training decision making. \nWhere these do not exist, as in many developing countries, establishing mechanisms for social \ndialogue needs to be given a high priority to incorporate labour market signals into training programs and priorities.\n161 In addition, training and education also has to facilitat e social in-\nclusion. The ILO warns that \u201cthe growth dividend from greening the economy will be attained only if access to new trainin g provided as part of green measures is made accessible to disa d-\nvantaged youth, persons with disabilities, rural communities and other vulnerable groups.\u201d\n 162 \nWomen need to be especially targeted by education policy measures.  \nFinally, the UN Environmental Ma nagement Group reminds us that greening the economy is \nnot only a matter of training the workforce to ensure a smooth transition \u2013 it is also a cultural \nchallenge. Unlocking the necessary innovation, fostering creativity and stimulating local d e-\nvelopment g oes beyond mere technological innovations, but will also require organizational \nand social innovation, which may in particular draw on local and indigenous knowledge sy s-\ntems and environmental practices.163 In a similar fashion, the ILO highlights that a holi stic \napproach to education for a green economy should not only focus on individuals as part of the labour force, but also as consumers: thus, it advocates \u201ccoherent multi -level skills development \nresponses\u201d that both raise environmental awareness among con sumers through general \nschooling or mass media, and which also nudge production towards more environmentally conscious practices through training programmes, vocational, technical and higher education \nand training, and lifelong learning at the enterprise level.\n164 \n5.5 Managing the Transformation: Towards a Coherent Policy Mix  \nAs argued above, the transformation to a g reen economy is an economy -wide task, which \ntherefore requires an integrated approach. Greening the economy is not (only) about fostering \na particular set of green sector s or industries , but about transforming the entire economy , \n156 International Labour Organisation, Employment and Social Inclusion in a Green Economy: Assessing Policies \nand Practices - Workshop Report . \n157 Ibid.  \n158 Strietska -Ilina et al., Skills for Green Jobs: A Global View . \n159 International Labour Organisation, Employment and Social Inclusion in a Green Economy: Assessing Policies \nand Practices - Workshop Report . \n160 Strietska -Ilina et al., Skills for Green Jobs: A  Global View . \n161 Ibid.  \n162 Ibid.  \n163 UN Environment Management Group, Working towards a Balanced and Inclusive Green Economy: A United \nNations System-Wide Perspective , 13. \n164 Strietska -Ilina et al., Skills for Green Jobs: A Global View . \n 48 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nwhich involves changing innovation patterns, redirecting investment, providing adequate \nskills and ensuring mobility of the labour force, and creating the right institutional framework \nconditions . For the transformation to succeed, it is necessary to balance the efforts across sec-\ntors \u2013 including energy, industry, transport , housing, food and agriculture. An integrated, \ncross -sectoral approach  is also a mat ter of efficiency \u2013 distributing the efforts will help to \nlower the overall cost of the transformation . \nThus, the policy mix for greening the economy needs to include sectoral policies and strategies as well as cross -cutting instruments that distribute eff orts among sectors. The previous se c-\ntions have discussed several types of instruments that can play a role in the process, including \npricing tools. Yet, to raise the public and political acceptability, a smart policy mix should i n-\nclude flanking measures \u2013 which reallocate  the cost burden of the transition  according to the \ncarrying capacity of economic sectors, or segments of society. Where necessary, flanking measures may  provide target ed assistance and temporary relief  to the most affected groups . \nTo prese rve the efficiency of pricing tools, such support should take the form of targeted and \ntemporary financial aid, or, even better, assist households and businesses to reduce their e x-\nposure and cut back their consumption of energy and resources, rather than e xempting pa r-\nticular groups from the price signal . \nBut beyond environmental policy instruments and flanking measures, a policy mix for the green economy is also about creating the necessary enabling conditions  for the transformation.  \nThis may include educational policies, efforts to connect  actors, forming networks and all i-\nances, generating social momentum, and also cultural change . But creating these enabling \nconditions may also involve institutional and governance reform, e.g. where existing instit u-\ntions lock  the economy into a resource - and e nergy -intensive growth pattern \u2013  such as state \nmonopolies on resource extraction, lacking or heavily distorted domestic  markets for energy \nresources , etc.  \nOn another level, managing the transformation to a low -carbon economy successfully also r e-\nquires attention for the procedural aspect of governance: success does not only depend on the choice of policy instruments or their design, it also matters how these policies are imple-\nmented, and how they fit into the wider political, institutional and legal context in which they \noperate. In this regard, some lessons can be learned from previous efforts to integrate or mainstream environmental aspects into other sectoral policies:\n165 this includes the need for \nclear priorities, targets and timetables, ongoing monitoring and evaluation of policy perfor m-\nance, provisions for a periodic revision of policies, a strong legal and political mandate for the greening of policies, and possibly the establishment of a high -ranking coordination b ody to \ncoordinate the efforts of different ministries and departments. Research has also shown that such policy integration is more compatible with communicative, participatory, and learning types of governance.\n166  \nAnd finally, as pointed out before, the success of a transformative set of policies hinges on the credibility of the political commitment to the green economy agenda, now and in the longer \nterm \u2013 not least to trigger the necessary investments from private investors. There are differ-\nent institutional and legal ways to give more credibility to a long -term commitment -  such as \nbacking at highest political level, installation of independent high -profile bodies tasked with \nmonitoring and evaluation, provision of  long-term investment guarantees, etc.. But perhaps \nmost importantly, the different policy instruments for a green economy need to be aligned \naround a consistent, convincing and compelling narrative .  \n165 Jordan and Lenschow, \u201cEnvironmental Policy Integration: A State  of the Art Review\u201d; European Environment \nAgency, Environmental Policy Integration in Europe - State of Play and an Evaluation Framework . \n166 Homeyer, Environmental Policy Integration and Mult i-Level Governance . \n 49 \n  UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \n6 Conclusions  \nAt first sight, one would be forgiven to th ink that the green economy shares the fate of many \nother abstract concepts: nobody quite knows what it is, but everyone supports it. The same \nwas often said about sustainable development \u2013 a concept that has been widely criticised as \nbeing too vague, lacki ng clarity, and accommodating all sorts of interpretations. Yet, in the \ncase of sustainable development, that has not kept the concept from having noticeable impact \non policies around the world during the last two decades. And arguably, the same can be sai d \nof many political concepts, such as \u201csocial justice\u201d or even \u201cdemocracy\u201d: there is no exact, un i-\nversal definition, and they might never be fully implemented in any country \u2013  but that does \nnot take away that they continue to have profound impact on people  all over the world. In this \nsense, it is not so much the exact definition of the green economy that matters, but rather the \nvision that the term embodies, and the aspirations it kindles.  \nOne of the points where there seems to be wide agreement is that the green economy should \nestablish as a new paradigm, a new model for economic development that is fit for the 21st cen-\ntury. The call for a new paradigm has grown out of frustration with the existing economic de-\nvelopment model, the limitations of which becoming increasingly apparent. Despite many \npositive achievements, it also results in widespread and often irreversible environmental deg-\nradation, health impacts, rising inequality and social unrest. It is therefore clear that the e x-\nisting model of resource -intensive growth is not sustainable in the long run, certainly not if it \nis extrapolated to a world population that may reach more than nine billion people within this \ncentury. It is also becoming clearer that the existing model is less and less capable of delive r-\ning a good life for all, and that a new model \u2013  the green economy \u2013  would actually increase \nhuman welfare and well -being, while respecting the ecological boundaries of the planet.  \nYet, important though it may be, a narrative itself may not necessarily  have much impact, \nunless it is substantiated with concrete targets and indicators, and implemented through po l-\nicy measures. What should these indicators measure \u2013  given that there is no exact and unive r-\nsally agreed definition of the green economy? First, it should acknowledge that, ultimately, the \noveruse of global ecosystems is a problem of absolute quantities. Therefore, while green \ngrowth and green investments can be tools for greening the economy, the yardstick is ult i-\nmately whether absolute levels of resource consumption and environmental degradation d e-\ncline, while achieving social inclusion. One role of indicators is therefore to define and mea s-\nure (ecological and social) boundaries. Optimisation should take place within these bound a-\nries, but is not a  goal in and of itself. Second, the indicators should measure what matters \u2013  \nabove all the well- being of individuals, rather than the overall monetary value of production \nand consumption in an economy, as measured by GDP. While it is questionable whether unlimited growth of material consumption can be accommodated within finite ecological \nboundaries, the case is less clear -cut for the growth of well -being \u2013 which, in addition to the \nmaterial basis, also includes social, cultural and spiritual aspects.  \nA second, related question is how to measure the progress towards the green economy. In pa r-\nticular, it is debatable whether there should be a separate global set of \u201cgreen economy indic a-\ntors\u201d \u2013 given that, with the future Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  and the review of \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), there are already two parallel target -setting \nprocesses at work at UN level, both of which represent a long -term, transformative and v i-\nsionary approach. While the SDG and MDG processes both are br oader in scope than the \ngreen economy debate, there is nonetheless considerable overlap between the processes. \nTherefore, if there should be a separate set of green economy indicators, its consistency with \nSDGs and MDGs has to be ensured. While the added v alue of green economy indicators at the \nglobal level may be debatable, that does not preclude the possibility that individual countries \n 50 \n UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nmay decide to adopt their own set of green economy indicators, in order to monitor the pr o-\ngress towards their national s trategy, concept or roadmap of a green economy.  \nIn terms of policies to bring about the green economy, one important starting point is that the \ngreen economy will build on private initiative and inventiveness, coordinated through ma r-\nkets. Yet in the curren t situation, markets fail to deliver optimal results, since the prices of \ngoods and services do not reflect the environmental and social impacts they cause. Thus, ne i-\nther consumers nor investors have an adequate incentive to reflect these external costs in  \ntheir decisions. The consequence is a substantial misallocation of resources towards uses that generate too little welfare and cause too many external costs. One obvious way of correcting this waste is to get the prices right, so that they reflect the tru e environmental and social \ncosts. This can be done in different ways \u2013  by raising taxes, installing cap -and-trade -schemes, \nor phasing out environmentally harmful subsidies. All of which \u2013 if done well \u2013 creates addi-\ntional revenue, which can be used to comp ensate and support particularly vulnerable groups.  \nBuilding a green economy will require a transformation of economies worldwide, diverting \nthem from their current path. This involves some element of structural change, promoting \nnew business models and challenging old ones. Such structural change will inevitably create \nwinners and losers: many sectors will clearly benefit from the green economy \u2013  beyond the \nobvious candidates like waste and water management or efficiency technologies, these also \ninclude ma ny services, IT and telecommunications, tourism, as well as cultural and creative \nindustries. For most sectors, there will be both challenges and opportunities \u2013  e.g. the energy \nsector, manufacturing, chemicals, transport and construction but also in agriculture, forestry and fishing. It will be up to each company in these sectors to make the most of the new oppor-\ntunities \u2013 or to resist the change, at the risk of perishing. There are only very few sectors for \nwhich the green economy presents a major challen ge \u2013 in particular the fossil fuel industry \n(mining, refining). They may not disappear entirely, but will see the size of their market d i-\nminish considerably. Yet, experience has shown that these sectors have considerably political clout \u2013 certainly in the resource -abundant parts of the world: the status quo also has its pr o-\nponents, who have invested massively in the current development path, and who are under-\nstandably concerned to lose the return on their investments if the current path changes. If the \ngreen economy is to address and, possibly, reverse some of the unsustainable trends that we \nsee in the current economic system, this will not be possible without upsetting some vested \ninterests.  \nWhile the affected sectors will voice their concerns, it is impor tant to bear in mind that the \ncosts of economic restructuring are transitional. In the medium run, the available empirical \nstudies suggest that the green economy will deliver more welfare and a better life \u2013  though \nperhaps not necessarily a higher GDP. Yet  transitional or not \u2013  the affected sectors and \ngroups will still need to pay the costs imposed on them in the short term. To avoid undue hardships and to enhance the political feasibility of a green economy transition, there may be \na case for supporting t he most affected sectors and groups (such as companies that faced \nstranded assets, or particularly vulnerable parts of society). However, such support should \ntake the form of a lump -sum compensation or transfer payment, rather than a continued e x-\nemption.  Better still are compensation or support measures that help vulnerable groups or \nsectors to reduce their exposure \u2013  e.g. helping poor households to reduce their energy con-\nsumption, rather than providing access to cheap energy.  \nThus: the concept of a green e conomy is needed, as a new narrative how the economy should \nwork to enhance the well -being of people around the world. The benefits of a green economy \nare obvious, and have been documented in a number of investigations, from local case studies \nto global ec onomic models. And the time is right for a green economy, as the dissatisfaction \n 51 \n UBA Texte  Green Economy: an Engine for Developme nt? \nwith the current economic system is growing, and as its limits are becoming apparent. But \u2013  \ndespite all these factors, that does not mean the green economy is going to happen by itself.  \n7 References  \nAfrican Development Bank.
