In order to make the best possible use of these services for the benefit of agricultural\nproduction, a better understanding of interlinkages between management measures, ecosystem\nservice/disservice balance and soil self-regulation potential is essential. In this context, it is well\nknown that the reduction of soil tillage intensity combined with mulching techniques, on the one\nhand, promote the survival, development and spread of plant pathogenic mycotoxin-producing\nsoil-borne fungi, but, on the other hand, enhance the diversity of antagonistic mycotoxin-\ndegrading fungivorous soil animals. However, up to now it is still unclear, which ecosystem\nservice/disservice balance results from both pathways and which self-regulation mechanisms are\ninvolved.\n \nTo analyse and assess the bioregulation potential of fungivorous soil faunal key species\n(earthworms: Lumbricus terrestris, collembolans: Proisotoma minuta, enchytraeids: Enchytraeus\ncrypticus and E. christenseni) on economically relevant plant pathogenic species of the fungal\ngenus Fusarium (F. graminearum, F. culmorum, F. verticillioides) and its mycotoxins\n(deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenon (ZEN), 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3AcDON) and fumonisin B1\n(FB1)) in maize residues, field and laboratory experiments were performed as part of the EU\nBiodivERsA project SoilMan. Based on these studies the following hypotheses were tested: (1) soil\nfaunal key organisms supress Fusarium species and reduce their mycotoxins in maize residues, (2)\nthe bioregulation potential depends on substrate size and soil texture (3) interactions between\nfungivorous key species affect their bioregulation potential, (4) leaching of mycotoxins represents\na potential risk for arable soils. \nThe results reflect that soil faunal key species regulate amounts of F. graminearum and F.\nculmorum in maize residues depending on substrate size and soil texture, but did not affect\namounts of F. verticillioides. Fungivorous soil animals significantly accelerate degradation rates of\nFusarium mycotoxins by up to 300%, depending on soil faunal species, respective mycotoxin and\nsoil texture. In particular, primary decomposers within the earthworm community (L. terrestris)\nare pivotal for the bioregulation of Fusarium species and their mycotoxins in the mulch layer. The\nbioregulation potential of the mesofauna (collembolans and enchytraeids) strongly depends on\nsoil faunal interactions. The findings further indicate that the mycotoxins DON and ZEN leach from\ninfected maize residues.\n \nThe present studies contribute to improve understanding of the complex interrelations between\narable management and ecosystem service/disservice balance in agroecosystems.\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
