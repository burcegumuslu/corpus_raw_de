Work life balance is a state of equilibrium in which the demand \nof both professional and personal life is equal. Each role hav ing different set of demands and when \nsuch role demands overlap, multiple problems are faced. In r eality life and work over-lap and interact. \nIn designing the work life policies employer should think that th e commitment of employees can make \nthe difference between those companies which compete at the marketplace and those which cannot. A \nbalanced life for women is one where they spread their ener gy and effort between key areas of \nimportance. This research study aims to figure out the working environment of public sector banks for \nwomen employees and what is the perception of women about the init iative and policies of banks and \neffects of those initiatives on their lives. Chi square test  is applied in this paper to check the \nauthenticity of data given by the respondents. The research is c onducted among working women in \nbanks with special reference to SBI, Bhopal (M.P.) city hea d office. We suggest that Work-Life \nBalance is not a problem to be solved. It is an ongoing issue to be manag ed. \n \nKeywords : Work life; Job satisfaction; working women; Social relationship;  Family etc. \n \n \n \n1.  INTRODUCTION \n \nDue to changes in the labor market and the changing nature of wor k, work-life balance \nis now at the top of the agenda for government and Private bodies . It is recognized that work-\nlife balance can lead indirectly to productivity gains through inc reased retention and helps \norganizations to respond to customer needs more effectively. In any b usiness and industrial \nactivities it is of utmost importance to have well trained, we ll groomed and emotionally \nbalanced workers available to take up employment challenges. This highlights the need \namong the companies to pay adequate attention to the work life bal ance of the workers. The \narrival of globalization makes the people working across countri es; as a result, concept of \nfixed working hours is vanishing away. Instead of just 7 or 8 a day, pe ople are spending as \nmuch as 12-16 hours every day in office. Therefore, tension and work rela ted pressure, \nresponsibilities at family makes an individual difficult to find balance between work and \npersonal life. Professional working in BPO industry, top executives , doctors, nurses, bank \nemployees, and IT professionals are the few examples who ar e facing the burden of work life \nimbalance constantly [2].

Organizations are setting up policies fo r maintaining a work life balance. They are \nintroducing innovative methods to keep their employ ees happy and satisfied, as it makes \noffice a better place to work and also impact posit ively on productivity. This write up tries to \nbring out the meaning of work life balance, their c auses, their effects on organizations and the \nmethods, systems and processes to reduce the impact  of work life imbalance. [3] \n \n \n2.  WHAT IS WORK LIFE BALANCE?  \n \nWork-life balance is used to describe the equilibri um between responsibilities at work \nand responsibilities outside paid work; having a wo rk-life balance means that this equilibrium \nis in the right position for the individual concern ed. For some people it means spending more \ntime in paid work and less time at home, while for others it means ensuring that paid work \ndoes not infringe on time needed for other responsi bilities. It is about managing our work \ncommitments with career goals, and our responsibili ties at home and the wider community. \nWork life and personal life are inter-connected and  interdependent. Work life and personal \nlife are the two sides of the same coin. People hav e to make tough choices even when their \nwork and personal life is nowhere close to equilibr ium. [6, 7] \n \n \n3.  STATE BANK OF INDIA \u2013 A PUBLIC SECTOR BANK \n \nThe public banks are those banks which are directly  under the control of State/Central \nGovernment. In this study State bank of India, Bhop al City (M.P.) head office and some \nselected branches of SBI Bhopal has taken into the account for research study purpose. The \nState bank of India is actively involved since 1973  in non-profit activity called Community \nServices Banking.  \n \n              FIGURE: 1                                                            FIGURE: 2  \n \n                          \n                      \nAll branches and administrative offices throughout the country sponsor and participate \nin large number of welfare activities and social ca uses. Bank\u2019s business is more than banking \nbecause we touch the lives of people anywhere in ma ny ways.  Bank\u2019s commitment to nation-\nbuilding is complete & comprehensive  [9]. \n \nFIGURE\t1:\tWORK\tLIFE\t \nIMBALANCE  \nFIGURE\t2:\tWORK\tLIFE\t \nBALANCE  2 Volume 7 4.  DOES WORK LIFE BALANCE MATTERS TO EMPLOYERS AND WOMEN \n     EMPLOYEES? \n \nWork-life balance policies and practices are becoming inc reasingly important to \nemployers even in bank because employee\u2019s motivation and sat isfaction, profitability and \nproductivity and recruitment and retention policies can be improved b y adopting flexible \nworking arrangements. Companies have to attract and keep the bes t employees to remain \ncompetitive.  A study conducted by (Dex and Smith, 2002) shows that [4]: \n(A)  There are positive effects on employee commitment from having famil y friendly policies.  \n(B)  Approximately nine out of every ten establishments with some experi ence of these \n        policies found them cost effectives.  \n(C)  Increase in performance was associated with having one or other fam ily friendly policy in \n       the case of five out of six performance indicators.  \nThe working sphere of Women in India is changing at incredible pa ce due to, \nprogressive reduction in trade barriers, modern innovation in technologies, globally \ninterconnected market place, cut throat competition and business rivalry and changing family \nand population patterns. By family pattern we mean the changin g family structure from joint \nfamily to nuclear family, altered family value systems, and diminished quality time for self \nand children, increase in time spent on internet and altered socia l exchanges and \ncommunications. These factors bring out tense anxiety into the li fe of the women and then it \nis magnified many times if both the husband-wife work and they  have children of growing \nage and old age parents. This constant worry can cause disorder on the psychological comfort \nof the women due to a feeling of diminished control over one's life and a  hopeless perception \nthat there is never enough time to have a sensible stability and balance in l ife.  \nThis mental stress for women lead to physical stress and caus e ill health, headache, \ngastritis, body ache etc. or lead to long term cardiac prob lems, high blood pressure, diabetes \nor other psychiatric problems. All these problems generate  Work life conflict especially for \nwomen employees, which results in: \n\u2022 Increased Absenteeism \n\u2022 Increased Employee Turnover \n\u2022 Reduced Productivity \n\u2022 Reduced Job Satisfaction \n\u2022 Increased Managerial Stress \n\u2022 Damage Family and Social relationship \n \nWork life imbalance causes relationship degradation for women emp loyees because \nworking too much may cause women to miss family interactions as w ell as important events. \nRelationships require nurturing, time and ongoing attention. Once damag e is done, it is often \nmore difficult and time consuming to repair than if appropriate  time and focus had occurred \nall along [9].  \n \n \n5.  EFFECTS OF POOR WORK LIFE BALANCE ON THE ORGNIZATION \n \n\u2022 Workers Punctuality, Teamwork, Customer service, work supervision re sponsibility, \ngroup behavior, peer interaction and leadership initiative by w orkers are reduced due to \nlowered self-worth and morale in workers due to conflict in  work life balance.  International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 7 3 \u2022 Creativity, new job-expertise learning and innovation of worker i s grossly undermined \ndue to lowering of work related enthusiasm among workers. \n\u2022 Workers having problem balancing work roles and family roles set bad standard in the \ncompany work setting and often upset the friendly work ambience.  \n\u2022 Workers problems get reflected negatively on company\u2019s turnove r, operating profit and \nbalance sheet. \n\u2022 Substantial increase in the cases of workers being absent on t he job and in extreme cases \nleaving the job.  \n \n \n6.  SOME CHALLENGES TO WORK LIFE BALANCE \n \nThere is still however an uneven dissemination of work-family lif e policies among \nemployers that causes future challenges as follows [13]. \n \n6. 1. Employers do not adequately and transparently communicate about work-lif e \n        balance   \nPoor communication results in lower levels of awareness. This ca n lead to members \ndoubting the integrity of senior management as they feel that com munication is unclear. The \nfactors contributing to this challenge include: \n\u2022  Organizational culture \n\u2022  Lack of interest about changing the status quo \n\u2022  Unwillingness and fear around how to manage a flood of requests if work-life balan ce \n    initiatives were better communicated (risk management). \n \n6. 2. Employers are pursuing inappropriate work-life balance arrangements \nThere is a mismatch between what employers offer and what members want. The key \nfactors contributing to this are: \n\u2022 Employers take the easy route with a one-size-fits-all approach. \n\u2022 Organizational size tends to restrict imagination and result in limited t hinking. \n \n6. 3. There are high levels of unmet demand for some work life balance options th at go \n        beyond the current \u2018family friendly\u2019 approach \nParticular demand for the opportunity to work in flexible hours and t o have time off to \ncare for children was found unmet demands. The key factors contributing to this a re: \n\u2022  A lack of recognition of the wants and needs of employees who have responsibil ities for \n    children. \n\u2022  No clear legislation that these employees can rely on to coerces empl oyers. \n \n \n6. 4. Managers act as barriers to members achieving appropriate work-life balan ce \nManagerial behavior and attitudes are both influenced by and are influences on \norganizational culture. While research has shown that management  role modeling of good \nwork-life balance behaviors is an enabler in helping staff m anage home and work. Various \nstudies have also shown that line managers having major influence on employee sat isfaction.  \n 4 Volume 7 The key factors contributing to this are: \n\u2022  Many line managers have lack of sufficient decis ion-making power to grant authority and \n    enable changes to working arrangements. \n\u2022  The hierarchy and processes inherent in most lar ge organizations mean that there are no \n    incentives for managers to act differently or t o think creatively about changing working \n    arrangements. \n \n6. 5. Self-esteem of Employees during the work  \nPositively contributes to work-life balance. Doctor s (particularly surgeons, \ngynecologists) don't really have a work-life balanc e. A large part of them have a very low \ntime balance but a very high satisfaction balance a nd their self-esteem is very high. A study \non gynecologists showed that their satisfaction bal ance was really high because of the \nsatisfaction of creating a new life, which was comp ensation enough for any kind of time \nimbalance.   \n \n                                                    FIGURE: 3  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n\u2022REDUCE ABSENTISEEM \n\u2022IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY \n\u2022ATTRACT SKILLED EMPLOYEE \n\u2022DECREASE EMPLOYEE TURNOVER \n\u2022ENHANCE DIVERSE RECRUITMENT & RETENTION \n\u2022LOWER RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING COST \n\u2022INCREASE RETURN ON INVESTMENT AS EMPLOYEE STAY \nLONGER \nEMPLOYER\u2019S BENEFIT \n\u2022LESS STRESS \n\u2022BETTER HEALTH \n\u2022LESS DISTRACTION \n\u2022HIGH JOB SATISFACTION \n\u2022FLEXIBILITY AT WORKPLACE \n\u2022HIGH MORALE AND MOTIVATION \n\u2022PROXIMITY TO HOME AND FAMILY \nEMPLOYEE\u2019S \nBENEFIT \nFIGURE 1: Benefits of Work Life Balance  International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 7 5 7.  RATIONAL OF THE STUDY \n \nWork-life balance is an issue of strategic importance to orga nizations and of \nsignificance to employees especially for women employee s. Organizational awareness and \naction with respect to implementing work life balance strate gies hinges on an Organization\u2019s \nneed to attract and retain valued employees in a highly competi tive labor market.  For \nemployees, work life balance is \u201cthe maintenance of a balan ce between responsibilities at \nwork and at home\u201d.  When work-life balance is achieved, people fe el that they have attained \nthe best possible quality of life. \nA good work life balance is central to employee effective ness and satisfaction, and \napprentice learning work life balance is about helping staff s combine work with their personal \ninterests and commitments. The governing body has a responsibility to ensure, so far as is \nreasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare at the work of al l their employees. \nThe objective of this research is to study the work life balan ce of working women in the \npublic sector banks. It has major influence on maintaining equili brium between professional \nlife and the personal life responsibilities. The research was conducted a mong working Women \nin Head office of State bank of India in Bhopal city. Work life b alance reduces friction \nbetween official and domestic life. The concept of balancing work and life is important in \nmore than one way. There can be many factors affect the balan ce of work and life, which may \nbe social factors, psychological factors, Working Environment, Typ e of job, Job satisfaction, \nFamily background, schedule at home and life stage. The employee who is able to maintain \nbalance between private and professional life can contribute mor e to success of the \norganization. \n \n \n8.  REVIEW OF LITRETURE \n \nThe aim of research of Sakthivel Rania, Kamalanabhanb & Selvar ania (2011) is to \nanalyze the relationship between employee satisfaction and w ork/life balance. The construct \nused for this research consists of career opportunity, recognition, work tasks, payments, \nbenefits, superior subordinate relationship, employee satisfa ction, and work/life balance. This \nstudy makes a contribution to join two distinct research streams, namely employee \nsatisfaction, and work/life balance. Findings suggest that high corre lation exists between work \ntask and employee satisfaction with a mediator variable namely work-lif e balance [11]. \nThe objective of research of V. Varatharaj, S. Vasantha (2012)  is to study the work life \nbalance of working women in service sector. Work life balance e ntails attaining equilibrium \nbetween professional work and other activities, so that it re duces friction between official and \ndomestic life. Work life balance enhances efficiency and thus, the  productivity of an \nemployee increases. It enhances satisfaction, in both the profes sional and personal lives. The \nfindings of the study reveal the majority of the women Employee s feel comfortable in their \nwork place irrespective of their trivial personal and work pla ce irritants. This paper attempts \nto indentify the various factor which helps to maintain work life ba lance among women \nemployees in service sector [13]. \nThe purpose of study of Babatunde Akanji (2012) is to explore the percepti ons of Work-\nLife Balance (WLB) practices in a developing nation of Nig eria. Thus, a qualitative approach \nwas employed by conducting 61 in-depth interviews with Nigerian e mployees (41 women and \n20 men) working in frontline employments in the banking, telecommunica tions and insurance \nsectors about their perceptions of WLB. The findings showed that though conflict situations \nexisted more than work-family enrichment, but under different circum stances due to the long 6 Volume 7 legacy of national challenges facing Nigeria. This paper se eks to add to the compendium of \nWLB discourse on a global scale by examining key barriers de tected to hinder its workable \npractices in Nigeria [1]. \nThe study of Muhammadi Sabra Nadeem (2009) was aimed to explore the relationship \nbetween work life conflict and job satisfaction in Pakistan. W e found that job satisfaction is \nsignificantly negatively correlated with work to family int erference and family to work \ninterference. Job satisfaction is also found to be negatively rel ated with stress in our research. \nHowever, the correlation of workload is positive and insignificant whi ch shows that workload \ndoes not affect the job satisfaction of the employees in Paki stan. The policy alternative should \nbe that a supportive management is required to minimize the confli ct between work and \nfamily. Top management should realize the importance of work li fe balance and its adverse \naffect on job satisfaction [10]. \nThe research paper of Susi.S, Jawaharrani. K (2010) shows that a c hanging economy \nand an aging workforce can join together to create an employm ent environment where \ncompetent employees who are unhappy in their current situations  are motivated to find a new \nplace to \"hang their hats\". A highly engaged workforce is 50 % mor e productive than an \nunengaged workforce. The majority of HR professionals (78 %) fee l employee engagement is \nimportant or extremely important to business success. Employe e engagement is increasingly \nviewed as a \u201cwin-win\u201d strategy for companies, employees, and their communities alike. In \naddition, work/life balance is increasingly important for engage ment and affects retention. \nThis paper will examine some of the literature on Employee engagement; explore work-place \nculture & work-life balance policies & practices followed in industries in order to promote \nemployee engagement in their organizations to increase their e mployee\u2019s productivity and \nretain them [12]. \nThe aim of the study of Lalita Kumari (2012) is to find out about t he employee\u2019s \nperception of their work life balance policies and practices  in the public sector banks. Quota \nsampling method was followed. Data was analyzed with the help of  factor analysis, \ndescriptive statistics, mean, t-test and Karl Pearson\u2019s corre lation. The findings of the study \nemphasized that each of the WLB factors on its own is a salient  predictor of job satisfaction \nand there is a significant gap among the female and male re spondents with job satisfaction \nwith respect to various factors of WLB. The result of study ma y have practical significance \nfor human resource managers of especially banks to improve sta ff commitment and \nproductivity along with designing their recruitment and retention policies  [9]. \nGururaja, Umesh Maiya, Elsa Sanatombi Devi, Anice George (2013) conducted \ndescriptive survey among 67 nursing faculty towards their percep tions and attitude towards \nquality of Work-Life showed that majority, 58 (86.57 %) experienced  well balanced work-\nlife, 9 (13.43 %) expressed moderately balanced work -life and none of  them rated under poor \nwork-life balance. Data regarding job satisfaction showed maj ority 35 (52.24 %) had \nmoderate job satisfaction and 32 (47.76 %) had high job satisfacti on. The correlation between \nwork life balance and job satisfaction showed positive correla tion ( r = 0.77) which can be \ninferred saying that high quality of work life balance will improve job satisfaction and vice \nversa [5]. \nThe purpose of article of Ken Roberts (2007) is to consider why w ork-life balance has \nbecome a major issue, and the likely outcomes of the widespread dissatisfaction with current \nwork schedules. Working time has not lengthened and complaints about tim e pressure are \nunrelated to hours actually worked. The sources of the widespread di ssatisfaction with current \nwork schedules will lie in a combination of other trends \u2013 increased l abor market participation \nby women, work intensification, the spread of feelings of job ins ecurity, more work being \ndone at odd hours, the spread of new information and communication technologi es, free time International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 7 7 increasing more slowly than spending power and aspirations, and rel atively long hours \nbecoming most common among employees (and the self-employed) in higher status jobs. An \noutcome is unlikely to be a general downward trend in hours worked on acc ount of the \nsubstantial opportunity costs that would often be incurred by empl oyees, and because some \n(mainly middle class) employees have access to a number of effective c oping strategies [7]. \nThe purpose of article of Joanna Hughes, Nikos Bozionelos (2007) is t o explore the \nviews of male workers in a male dominated occupation on issues that  pertain to work-life \nbalance. It emerged that work-life imbalance was not only a sour ce of concern, but also that it \nwas the major source of dissatisfaction for participants. Furt hermore, participants made a \nclear connection between problems with work-life balance and withdrawal behaviors, \nincluding turnover and non-genuine sick absence [6]. \n \n \n9.

FINDINGS \n \n\u2022 Respondents report average level of work life balance and are gener ally happy with their \nworking arrangements. \n\u2022 There is a feeling that employers are investing in work-life  balance, but the \u2018solutions\u2019 \noffered are not always compatible with employee\u2019s needs. \n\u2022 In some cases it is found that employers are not making suff icient investment in managing \nthe implementation of initiatives. \n\u2022 Some respondents feel that they are not always making well-inf ormed decisions about their \nown work-life balance. \n\u2022 While some feel that their employer deliberately communicat es work-life balance policies \nineffectively. \n\u2022 Employees are pragmatic about workable solutions; although mem bers have views about \ntheir \u2018ideal\u2019 working arrangement; they are prepared to sett le for different arrangements and \nare willing to make compromises and to balance their own needs w ith those of the \norganization, customers and other staff. \n\u2022 Somewhere it is found that balancing care and work affects career progr ession. \n\u2022 In some branches of the bank, available work-life balance o ptions are not always \nappropriate. \n\u2022 Somewhere employers do not adequately and transparently communicat e about work-life \nbalance. \n\u2022 Work-life balance options for which there are high levels of demand are parti ally provided. \n 18 Volume 7 \u2022  Somewhere managers act as barriers to members achieving approp riate work-life balance. \n\u2022 WLB is an important determinant of intrinsic aspects of job satisfact ion. \n\u2022 If the employees are given freedom to choose their own work sc hedules; quality and \nproductivity of the work increases. Because if this opportunity gi ven to the employee so it \nwill also bring to the responsibility for finishing work within specified de adline. \n\u2022 Management and employee both are responsible for having work life balance . \n\u2022 The research reveals that 37 % of the women employees who work in the banks are always \nagree that they are able to manage the private life without affectin g professional life.  \n\u2022 It is found that most of the women employees enjoy the job and  feel comfortable at their \nwork place. This might be the reason for the growth of women empl oyees at the working \nplace in banking sector.  \n\u2022 It is found that some of the employees agree that they are p hysically stressed in their job. \nAnd some of the employees strongly agree that they are mentally pres surized in their job.  \n\u2022 Employees agree that their superiors are more helpful and c ooperative which may be one of \nthe reason for women employees to balance between their private lif e and professional life  \n\u2022 The research shows that mostly women employees work in banks for  financial support and \nremaining to face life challenges.  \n\u2022 High quality of work life balance will improve the job satisfaction and vi ce versa. \n\u2022 Most of the working women found participative environment in the banks especially in \nState bank of India but they didn\u2019t found allotted work as per their qualifica tion. \n\u2022 Working hours are satisfactory but sometimes late working and wor king in evening \nbranches in banks interrupts work life balance. \n\u2022 Most of the women found good work life balance and career growth in State bank of India.   \n \n \n12. CONCLUSION \n \nToday we see women working in almost all types of professions dem onstrating that \nthere is no gender difference in work. In fact many organizations say  that women are playing \na vital role in uplifting the organization. This is a positive deve lopment that women are \nmaking their presence in different walks of life. On the other  hand, for every woman there is \none more background to manage, which is home and personal life.  \nToday with increasing demands at work place, the interface be tween work life and \npersonal life assumed significance which demands more attention . The pressures of the work \nor personal life can lead to stress. According to studies, i t has been found that such situation \naffects person's health both physiologically and psychologicall y.   \nTherefore, it is important for employees to maintain a hea lthy balance between work \nand their private lives.  \nFor the employers, Work-life balance of employees will be  an important input in \ndesigning appropriate policies for employees to address wor k \u2013life balance issues. Work-life \nbalance initiatives should be designed to help employees to bal ance their work and personal \nlife. Also our research study aims to figure out the working environm ent of public sector \nbanks for women employees and what is the perception of women abou t the initiative and \neffects of those initiatives taken by the banks because Work-Lif e Balance is not a problem to \nbe solved. It is an ongoing issue to be managed. International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 7 19 13.  SUGGESTIONS \n \n\u2022 Although the female respondents agreed with banks WLB policies but  they disagreed with \noverall WLB. So the female employees should be given the facil ities like flexi time; job \nsharing; cr\u00e8che facilities, and necessary breaks so that they feel that the organization is \nhelping them in coordinating the family and professional life. \n\u2022 In well-managed firms, the hours worked by both managerial and non-man agerial staff are \nnot significantly higher than those in badly run firms. This again c onfirms that working \nsmarter not harder is the key determinant to successful management . Hence there should \nbe well designed flexible working hours. \n\u2022 WLB improve the productivity and eliminate job stress, employ ers can also make efforts \nto know the workload and job demands. \n\u2022 Employer need to examine employee training, communication, rewa rd system, coworker \nrelationship and work environment. \n\u2022 If the employees are given freedom to choose their own work schedul es; quality and \nproductivity of the work increases. Because of this opportunity give n to the employee will \nalso bring to the responsibility for finishing work within specified tim e. \n\u2022 Nonfinancial rewards often have more impact than financial reorg anization in attaining \njob satisfaction and managing life. \n\u2022 Undertake a review of existing policies and improve current prac tices on flexible working \narrangements. \n\u2022 Ensure fairness and consistency in the way bank policies that s upport work-life balance \nare implemented. \n\u2022 Consider the implications for work-life balance in relation to w orkloads and work outside \nconventional hours. \n\u2022 Specific Counseling programs on Work Life Balance and Family w elfare programs and \nfamily counseling programs can be conducted. \n\u2022 Employees\u2019 social gathering programs and public contact pro grams will be the better \noption to reduce the mental pressure in the work place as the st udy reveals more mental \npressure for the Women employees.  \n\u2022 Regular exercises, mediation and other soft skill practices ca n improve the emotional \nbalance of the employees.  \n\u2022 More and more career and advancement opportunities should be provided to t he young \nemployees for professional as well as personal growth.  \n\u2022 Managerial people should feel that if they support the execut ives and non executives \nwholeheartedly the achievement of the mission of the organization be  facilitated and \ncompensation should be providing on the basis of team performance. So t hat no one feel \njealousy with respect to WL policies. \n\u2022 As it shows that different age groups have different percept ions regarding WLB, so work \nshould be distributed according to the age and qualification. It will improve the \nemployee\u2019s commitment and satisfaction level along with productivity a nd profitability. \n\u2022 A supportive management is required to minimize the conflict bet ween work and family. \nTop management should realize the importance of work life bal ance and its adverse affect \non job satisfaction. 20 Volume 7 \u2022 Manager should necessarily build familiar relationship, connection a nd understanding \nwith workers. \n\u2022 Bank should have formal counseling department to understand the workers w ork life \nbalance problems and to help the workers to get the solution. \n\u2022 Manager should undertake employee\u2019s survey periodically to understand the requirements \nand views of workers related to work life balance. \n\u2022 Generous leave facility, both with or without pay in case of fam ily urgency should be \nconsidered as much as possible. \n\u2022 Initiate and engage discussion with workers using social media to understand their work \nlife balance needs and aspirations. \n\u2022 Make arrangement for infant / child care inside the office for working wome n. \n\u2022 Create a work environment free of harassment & discrimination. \n\u2022 Banks should introduce job sharing option in which full-time post is s plit across two \nworkers who agree on working hours decided in between them and career breaks \n(paid/unpaid).  \n\u2022 Self-rostering should be implemented in which staff nominates the ir preferred shifts and \nshifts are allocated as far as possible to fit these preferences.  \n \n \nReferences \n \n[1]  Babatunde Akanji (2012), \u201cRealities Of Work Life Balance In Ni geria: Perceptions Of \nRole Conflict And Coping Beliefs\u201d, Vol. 10(2), pp.  248-263.   \n[2]  Brough P., Holt J., Bauld R., Biggs A., Ryan C.
