The book begins with a chapter on the meaning of mindfulness, then moves on to chart the spread of Buddhism into the western world and examine the development of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). The second half of the book considers some of the growing concerns related to mindfulness such as the loss of the moral and communitarian values of Buddhism, and the psychologicization and medicalization of existential problems into a capitalist society.\nKeywords\n- Mindfulness Practices\n- Psychiatric Disorders\n- Sati\n- Kabat Zinn\n- Cognitive Psychotherapy\n- Complimentary
