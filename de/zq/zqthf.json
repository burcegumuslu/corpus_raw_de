{"title": "Effect of niacin on the efficiency of nitrogen utilisation in the rumen of dairy cows", "author": "Aschemann; Martina", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of an oral niacin supplementation of 6 g per day to a diet deficient in ruminally degradable protein (RDP) on rumen metabolism, microbial protein synthesis, nitrogen (N) balance and N utilisation in lactating cows. It should be assessed to what extend a niacin supplementation can compensate for restricting effects of a negative rumen N balance (RNB) on rumen fermentation. A total of 9 ruminally and duodenally fistulated lactating multiparous German Holstein cows was used and the diets varied as follows: RNB0 with energy, utilisable crude protein (uCP), and RNB (0.08 g N/MJ ME) according to the average requirement of the animals; RNB- with energy and uCP at the duodenum according to the average requirement of the animals, but with a negative RNB (-0.41 g N/MJ ME); and diet NA, which was the same ration as RNB-, but supplemented with 6 g niacin/d. Reducing the amount of RDP in the diet caused several effects in the N metabolism of the animals. The negative RNB reduced N excretion with urine, the total N excreted with urine and faeces, and the N balance. Plasma and milk urea content were lower as well as ammonia content in rumen fluid. Also the digestibility of the diet, in particular NDF, was reduced. Number of protozoa in rumen fluid was enhanced while the amount of microbial crude protein (MP) and the amount of uCP reaching the duodenum declined during N deficiency, but the use efficiency of N for MP synthesis and for milk production was higher. Supplemental niacin decreased the daily N excretion with faeces and elevated the N balance. No effects on milk yield and composition were observed, but the ammonia content in rumen fluid was higher. Addition of niacin could compensate for the decline in NDF digestibility. The number of protozoa in rumen fluid was higher in NA treatment as compared to RNB-. The amount of MP reaching the duodenum per day was unaffected by niacin administration, but the efficiency of MP synthesis from RDP was elevated compared to RNB-. In conclusion, supplemental niacin to diets with a negative RNB induced a more efficient use of rumen degradable N. A shift in the rumen microbial community which was mainly due to an increased number of protozoa may have led to modifications of rumen fermentation and changes in the composition of MP reaching the duodenum.", "sitename": "Universit\u00e4ts- und Landesbibliothek Bonn", "date": "2012-08-14", "id": null, "license": null, "body": null, "comments": "", "commentsbody": null, "raw_text": null, "text": "Aschemann, Martina: Effect of niacin on the efficiency of nitrogen utilisation in the rumen of dairy cows. - Bonn, 2012. - Dissertation, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t Bonn.\nOnline-Ausgabe in bonndoc: https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:hbz:5n-29433\nOnline-Ausgabe in bonndoc: https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:hbz:5n-29433\n@phdthesis{handle:20.500.11811/5120,\nurn: https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:hbz:5n-29433,\nauthor = {{Martina Aschemann}},\ntitle = {Effect of niacin on the efficiency of nitrogen utilisation in the rumen of dairy cows},\nschool = {Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t Bonn},\nyear = 2012,\nmonth = aug,\nnote = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of an oral niacin supplementation of 6 g per day to a diet deficient in ruminally degradable protein (RDP) on rumen metabolism, microbial protein synthesis, nitrogen (N) balance and N utilisation in lactating cows.
