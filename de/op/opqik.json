For example, it can promote knowledge-based processes and stimulate innovation, improve the security and processing of research data as well as facilitate interdisciplinary and international scientific collaboration.\nThe German science organisations are convinced that an EOSC can be a success if its elaboration is guided by science. This means that the technical benefit is in the foreground and users are adequately represented in all decision-making structures of an EOSC. At the same time, existing national structures, competences, functionalities and initiatives related to research data management need to be adequately taken into account and stable financing ensured, not only for the development but also for the operational phase.\nThe Alliance of Science Organisations sees its opinion concerning the EOSC as a constructive critical contribution to a science-policy process. The members argue in favor of a balance of scientific and political interests that is appropriate to the interests of science. The Alliance of Science Organisations is ready to actively participate in the further elaboration of the plans for the development of an EOSC and to contribute to concrete solutions.", "language":
