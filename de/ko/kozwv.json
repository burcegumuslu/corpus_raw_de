A stability assistance system with an electric motor acting on the handlebars can provide steering assistance and help stabilize a pedelec. However, the steering interventions can possibly affect the cyclist and his riding experience. Using a steer assisted pedelec, this study investigates the influence of these interventions on the cyclist and his riding experience at low speeds.\n- Keywords (DE)\n- Pedelec, Sicherheit, Feldstudie, Gleichgewicht, Stabilit\u00e4t, ICSC\n- Keywords (EN)\n- Pedelec, safety, field study, balance, stability, ICSC\n- university_publisher\n- Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, \u201cFriedrich List\u201d Faculty of Transport and Traffic Sciences, Institute of Transport Planning and Road Traffic\n- version\n- publizierte Version / Verlagsversion\n- URN Qucosa\n[urn:nbn:de:bsz:14-qucosa2-825292](https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:14-qucosa2-825292)\n- Qucosa date of publication\n- 03.01.2023\n- Document type\n- in_proceeding\n- Document language\n- English\n- licence\n[CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": [null, "/en/", "/en/", "/en/landing-page/#skip2content", "/en/landing-page/#skip2nav", "/en/legal-notice/", null, null, null, "https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:14-qucosa2-825292", "/id/qucosa:81360", "https://doi.org/10.25368/2022.482", "https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:14-qucosa2-825292", "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", null, null, "https://tud.qucosa.de/api/qucosa%3A82529/attachment/ATT-0/?L=1", null, "/en/landing-page/", "/en/landing-page/", null, null, "/en/", "/en/about-qucosa/", "/en/search/", "/en/submission-details/", "/en/faq/", "/en/legal-notice/", "/en/privacy-policy/", "http://www.qucosa.de/typo3/", "/landing-page/?L=0", "/landing-page/https%3A%2F%2Ftud.qucosa.de%2Fapi%2Fqucosa%253A82529%2Fmets/?L=0", "/en/landing-page/", "/landing-page/https%3A%2F%2Ftud.qucosa.de%2Fapi%2Fqucosa%253A82529%2Fmets/?L=1", "http://www.dini.de/", "https://www.slub-dresden.de/"]}
