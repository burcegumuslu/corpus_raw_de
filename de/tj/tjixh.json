In our experience, studying traditional, complementary, and alternative medicines inevitably leads to ac-\ncusations of partiality: one is blamed either for taking sides in favor of bio-medicine and against alternative healing systems, or for advocating alterna-\ntive healing systems without pointing out the alleged risks they imply. In \npresenting papers on the topic, we have often felt that our audience tended \nto prick up their ears on hearing what they feared, expecting us to take sides \nin either promoting or condemning biomedicine or alternative medicine. This \nexperience, which reinforced our desire to approach this topic from an unbi-ased perspective, is one reason why this publication is so important to us.  \nThis collection has benefitted from the support of many people. Laura \nFeldt und Gregory Alles shared our interest in not subjecting any kind of healing system to value judgements, and their comments helped us to im-prove the consistency of our arguments. We are also grateful to Johannes Quack for feedback on our initial drafts. Our sincerest thanks go to Robert Parkin for his linguistic proof-reading; his flexibility, patience, and feeling \nfor language were of invaluable value. Julia Swoboda and Mirjam Aesch-\nbach undertook the task of formatting and formal ly proof-reading the manu-\nscript. Our heartfelt thanks go to them both for their academic expertise and \ntheir invariable good spirits in having to cope with complex formatting rules. \nFinally, we thank all of our authors. Some of them revised their papers \ndespite looming deadlines for their PhD these s or the challenges of preg-\nnancy and parenthood.

Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens and Monika Schrimpf, Zurich / Tuebingen, July 2018   \n  \nIntroduction  \nObserving the Entanglement of Medicine, Religion, and \nSpirituality through the Lens of Differentiation \nDorothea L\u00fcddeckens and Monika Schrimpf  \n \n \nIn the history of religions, tasks such as curing bodily ailments, treating the \nsick, and dealing with dying were often assigned to religious experts. Con-cepts such as the body, illness, and health were anchored in the world views and practices of the respective religious traditions. As Pamela Klassen (2016: 401) writes: \u201cMedical knowledge and techniques have often emerged di-\nrectly from religious traditions, making the line between these two admit-\ntedly unstable categories\u2014religion and medicine\u2014particularly hard to draw with any certainty.\u201d In historical contexts, the disentangling of medicine, re-ligion, and spirituality is seemingly impossible. With regard to contemporary societies, one may take Klassen\u2019s observation a step further and ask whether it is at all possible to draw a clear line between \u201creligion\u201d and \u201cmedicine.\u201d \nResearch in medical anthropology tends to emphasize that on the emic level, \nactors often do not distinguish between religion and medicine.\n1 Besides, de-\nbates on secularization theory discuss the question of whether and in what ways the functional differentiation of modern societies that is observed in Europe and North America, including the differentiation of religion and \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1  In case s of medical pluralism, Krause et al. (2012: 17 \u201318), for example, refer to \nthe work of Murray Last and David Parkin, who argue against the concept of \n\u201cmedical systems\u201d and point out that actors often make use of a variety of medical (and religious) traditions without differentiating between \u201cmedical\u201d and \u201creli-gious\u201d practices and knowledge.  10 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens and Monika Schrimpf   \nmedicine, can also be claimed for non-European countries and cultural tradi-\ntions (cp. Wohlrab-Sahr/Burchhardt 2017; for Japan cp. Rots/Teeuwen 2017; Schrimpf 2018). \nTaking up these reflections, we raise the questions of whether it makes \nsense to refer to \u201creligion\u201d and \u201cmedicine\u201d as two different realms, and whether it is acceptable for etic academic research to make use of concepts (or differentiations) that do not reflect self-perceptions and concepts on the emic level.  \n \n1  DOES IT MAKE SENSE T O DIF FERENTIATE \nBETWEEN RELIGION AND  MEDICINE?  \n \nIn contrast to the considerations sketched out above, we argue that it is im-\nportant to maintain the paradigm of differentiating between \u201creligion\u201d and \u201cmedicine,\u201d at least in contemporary societies, for the following reasons.  \n1.1  The Contemporary Differentiation between \u201cReligion\u201d \nand \u201cMedicine\u201d: A Global Paradigm  \n \nSocial differentiation is a characteristic of modern societies, including the social systems denoted by \u201creligion\u201d and \u201cmedicine,\u201d though to different de-grees. In the following, we argue that, thanks to the specific evolution of modern academic medicine (cp. L\u00fcddeckens)\n2 and the worldwide spread of \nbiomedicine, differentiating \u201creligion\u201d and \u201cmedicine\u201d has become a global paradigm. Nevertheless, there are many cases of non-differentiation or of the entangling of religion and medicine. \nWhen we talk about the entangling or de-differentiation of \u201creligion\u201d and \n\u201cmedicine\u201d, we are not referring to cases in which religious and medical ac-tors or actions coexist, as, for example, in a hospital where physicians deal \nwith the physical needs of their patients and chaplains deal with their spiritual \nneeds. Nor are we dealing with cases where a physician talks with his or her patient first about an impending operation and afterwards about the patient\u2019s fear of dying. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n2  All ref erences without a year designation refer  to contributions in this volume.   Introduction  | 11 \nSuch cases are in line with the global development of social differentia-\ntion. Our interest is rather directed at practices and concepts that involve \nmedical and religious arguments and aims at the same time, that take medical as well as religious concepts into account, or that deal with both the physical \nand the transcendent aspects, including transcendent entities, thus pursuing \nmedical and religious goals within one and the same framework. \nThe entangling of \u201cmedicine\u201d and \u201creligion\u201d may therefore be observed \nin cases where religious concepts, such as spiritual development, are guiding principles for medical treatment, as in a n anthroposophical hospital (cp. \nZeugin et al.), or where, as in Transpersonal Psychology, religious experi-\nence is induced on purpose in order to support therapeutic aims (cp. Gripen-\ntrog), to name but two examples. \nThese de-differentiated entanglements can be observed especially at the \nmargins of either \u201creligion\u201d or \u201cmedicine,\u201d as we will outline below. Such cases of entanglement rather confirm the global character of the paradigm of differentiated religion and medicine: even when actors do not differentiate, \nthey often relate to this paradigm and are judged accordingly. These pro-\ncesses are particularly visible in the ways in which therapeutic practices and knowledge are labeled.  1.1.1  Differentiation in the Mainstream, Entanglement at \nthe Margins?  \n Many scholars have discussed the differentiation of \u201creligion\u201d and \u201cmedi-cine\u201d in the context of their respective institutions and professions, including their knowledge and techniques, with regard to \u201cWestern\u201d societies (cp. Beyer 2012; L\u00fcddeckens 2012; Luhmann 1983, 1990a; Pars ons 2001; Vogd \n2011). On the one hand, modern academic medicine, also called biomedi-\ncine,\n 3 does not accept religious concepts and practices as part of its biomed-\nical framework. Due to the global spread of this kind of medicine, the disen-\ntangling of biomedicine and religion can be observed far beyond so- called \nWestern  societies, although in different ways and to different degrees. For \nexample, in Japan and Tanzania, public health care supports primarily bio-medical institutions.  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n3  Similar terms include \u201cconventional medicine, mainstream medicine, Western \nmedicine, orthodox medi cine,\u201d and \u201callopathic medicine\u201d.  \u201c \u201d12 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens and Monika Schrimpf   \nHowever, even in modern societies, biomedicine is only one healing sys-\ntem among others. In many countries, officially recognized medicine also \nincludes more or less \u201csecularized\u201d (and re-invented) forms of pre-modern medicine, often labeled \u201ctraditional medicine,\u201d in which religious and medi-\ncal concepts are intertwined with therapeutic practices such as Siddha medi-\ncine (cp. Rageth), Ayurveda, and Unani in India, or kanp\u014d medicine in Japan. In other cases, modern medical innovations in the field of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), such as anthroposophic medicine\n4 or ho-\nmeopathy, are officially acknowledged, as in the Swiss health- care system. \nWhile the religious connections or aspects of these healing systems are dis-\nputed, they often claim to be \u201cholistic,\u201d in contrast to biomedicine. Many \nmedical professionals trained in these therapeutic practices claim not only to address the physical and mental aspects of their patients\u2019 illnesses but also to take care of their spiritual needs.  \nOn the other hand, religious actors, institutions, and communities that \nconsider themselves as belonging to the \u201cmainstream\u201d religions often display \na ready acceptance of the differentiation between religion and medicine, even \nthough this deprives their institutions of an important social function that they have formerly fulfilled. By accepting biomedicine and its claims to med-ical authority and by refraining from raising their own claims of therapeutic competence beyond religious support, these religious actors and institutions present themselves as modern and as compatible with modern societies. This \nis the case with the European mainstream churches as well as with interna-\ntionally or nationally acknowledged Islamic institutions such as the Al Azhar University in Cairo or the healthcare system in Saudi Arabia (cp. Khalil et al. 2018).  \nTo quote Steve Bruce: \n \n\u201cNow only the fringes of religion\u2014New Agers employing Amerindian cures, Jeho-\nvah\u2019s Witnesses rejecting blood transfusion in favor of prayer, US television evange-\nlists claiming that HIV/AIDS is divi ne punishment for homosexuality \u2014practice or \nreject medicine. The mainstream \u2014primarily political response\u2014can be seen in the \nChurch of England\u2019s response to HIV/AIDS: it recommends that the government in-vest more in scientific research. \u201d (2016: 640)  \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n4  Anthroposophi c medicine perceives itself as \u201cintegrated medicine\u201d .  Introduction  | 13 \nBruce\u2019s observation that the tendency to engage in healing practices occurs \nrather on the institutional margins or in non-mainstream segments of reli-gious traditions is supported by studies of Sufi Islam (cp. Selim 2015), and charismatic Christianity (cp. Brown 2011).\n5 In these cases, religious actors \nemphasize the superiority of religious authority over medical authority in dealing with cases of illness.\n Another example in the context of New Age \nspirituality is the intertwining of spiritual and psychotherapeutical goals (cp. Gripentrog).   1.1.2  The Paradigm of Differentiation as a Frame  \n  of Reference  \n Even though in cases of traditional medicine, faith healing, and so forth, the assumption that medicine and reliion are separate realms or systems that can be differentiated from each other seems absurd, this does not mean that the notion of differentiation is irrelevant. The notions of differentiation and of \nthe subsequent hegemony of biomedicine strongly affect contemporary dis-\ncourses and techniques related to the curing of illness globally. Proponents of diverse forms of medical knowledge and therapeutic practices define their own positions within this diversity by referring to the differentiation between religion and (scientific) medicine, or to the alleged authority of biomedicine, whether in affirmative, critical, or integrative ways. They react to the pre-\nsumed hegemonic status of biomedicine in the society concerned and are \njudged accordingly.  \nAs Schrimpf shows, for example, a contemporary Japanese Buddhist \npriest\u2014that is, a religious actor\u2014explains the medical effects of Buddhist practice by drawing analogies with scientific studies and referring to Transpersonal Psychology (cp. Schrimpf). Here, reference to a particular \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n5  The distinctio n between mainstream religion and its margins as applied here refers \nonly to the level of institutionalized, official religion. As Meredith McGuire has \nshown in her study on \u201clived religion\u201d in the USA, individual religious practices \nand beliefs do not necessarily coincide with officially acknowledged religious knowledge and practice. Her s and other studies have analyzed cases in which \nmembers of Christian \u201cmainstream\u201d communities engage in non -Christian spir-\nitual practices, some of which are attributed wit h healing effects (cp. , for example, \nMcGuire 2008:6 \u201310; for Germany, cp. Bochinger  et al. 2009).  14 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens and Monika Schrimpf   \nimage of medicine as scientific is applied to legitimize claims regarding the \ntherapeutic authority of religion. Whereas some practitioners of CAM like Ayurveda emphasize the spiritual aspects of their therapies in order to dis-tinguish their practice from biomedicine, others de-emphasize the metaphy s-\nical dimensions of their therapies because they want them to be acknowl-edged as equal to biomedical treatments. \nAs a consequence, the notion of differentiation and the hegemony of an \nallegedly non-religious biomedicine is reproduced not only by those who support it, but also by those who deny it or who claim their own superiority over it. This is often done by criticizing biomedicine as non-holistic, as lack-\ning any spiritual or religious dimension, and as dealing only superficially \nwith symptoms, instead of curing the (spiritual) causes of illnesses. This re-production leads to a circular process, being reflected in discourses, termi-nologies, regulations, professions, social structures, and so on, which simul-taneously condition forms of self-positioning and are shaped by them. In this sense, the differentiation between \u201creligion\u201d and \u201cmedicine\u201d can be de-\nscribed as a social reality that is constantly negotiated, that is, produced and \ndissolved by the actors involved. \n \n1.1.3  The Power of Words  \n Labeling is an important strategy in pursuing such negotiations. Terms such \nas faith healing, traditional medicine, CAM, biomedicine, and Western med-\nicine are used in academic publications, as well as in emic discourses. These terms are closely interrelated, and their emergence reflects not only medical diversity, but also a hierarchical order within this diversity. According to Klassen (2016: 404), \u201c[b]iomedicine\u2019s overwhelming social, political, and economic authority\u2014and many would argue, its bodily efficacy\u2014is what \ntransforms other, non-biomedical therapeutic approaches into \u2018alternative\u2019 or \n\u2018complementary\u2019 therapies.\u201d \nAll these terms are controversial, their meaning being contested both \netically and emically. In environments that display medical diversity, in \nwhich representatives of various therapeutic practices and forms of knowledge compete for medical authority and claims to power, they take on \nspecific meanings and functions. For example, whereas the label \u201cfaith heal-\ning\u201d may exclude religious therapeutic practices from national health- care \nsystems, \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d and even \u201ccomplementary\u201d or \u201cintegrative  Introduction  | 15 \nmedicine\u201d may allow their inclusion. In this sense, again, the paradigm of \ndifferentiated \u201cmedicine\u201d and \u201creligion\u201d conditions strategies of labeling which simultaneously contribute to consolidating this paradigm. \nPower struggles over medical care are strongly influenced by political, \nlegal, or economic structures. As Walter Bruchhausen demonstrates for the concept of \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d in Tanzania, local, national, and interna-tional institutions, such as medical training institutions, health ministries, or the World Health Organization, provide official definitions of the terms men-tioned above. These definitions impact upon the legal and economic condi-tions in which therapeutic practices are engaged, as well as upon their acces-\nsibility (cp. Bruchhausen). The possibility of offering therapies that do not \ncomply with the biomedical paradigm of abstaining from religious claims and interpretations depends upon these basic conditions and their structural constraints. Concrete examples of how these terms are applied and interre-lated in order to (re-)configure a plurality of medical practices from different perspectives and to be able to position oneself in relation to this plurality are \ndiscussed for India, Tanzania, Japan, and Europe in this volume. \n \n1.2  Recogni zing  Power Relations and Self -Positionings \nthrough the Lens of  Differentiation  \n \nAs explained above, the global spread of this differentiation implies that the \nde-differentiation and entanglement of concepts and practices can be ob-served within the frame of \u201cdifferentiated religion and medicine.\u201d Thus, we \ncan analyze, for example, strategies of self-positioning within the entangle-ment of religion and medicine. This includes actors in medical institutions like an anthroposophical hospital or conventional palliative-care wards, who \naim to extend their fields of competence and increase their agency by includ-\ning spiritual-religious concepts and practices (such as spiritual development or aroma therapy) in their medical work (cp. L\u00fcddeckens; Zeugin et al. ). \nThese actors frequently disguise the religious aspects of therapeutic practices by using the label \u201cspiritual\u201d in order to avoid possibly negative images of religion within a medical context.  \nAnother example of de-emphasizing the religious aspects of medical \npractices is political actors in Tanzania, whose definitions of \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d aim to re-establish pre-modern medical practices devoid of their religious interpretations and ritual elements (cp. Bruchhausen). Similarly, 16 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens and Monika Schrimpf   \npractitioners of Ayurveda describe their activities as \u201cspiritual\u201d or \u201cmedical,\u201d \ndepending on the legal conditions of health policies and the needs of patients (cp. Pattathu). \nIn contrast, religious actors in established traditions may call their thera-\npeutic knowledge and practices \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d in order implicitly to advocate the pre-differentiation state of entangled religion and medicine, as is observable, for example, in contemporary Japanese Buddhism (cp. Schrimpf). For the same reason, \u201chereditary\u201d Siddha practitioners oppose the professionalization of their medical tradition (cp. Rageth). Obviously, the phrase \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d can be used to support strategies to both con-\nsolidate and counteract the entanglements of religion and medicine, depend-\ning on the respective social and political contexts. Not all strategies, how-ever, refer to the labeling or use of terms; others may aim to create a specific relationship between religious and medical authority.  \nWe will conclude with some general reflections on the second question \nraised in the beginning: is it acceptable for etic academic research to make \nuse of concepts (or differentiations) that do not reflect self-perceptions and \nconcepts on the emic level? \n  \n2  ETIC APPROACHES TO E MIC PERSPECTIVES: \nREPRODUCING OR ANALY ZING?  \n \nAt the IAHR conference in Erfurt in 2015 we organized three panels on \u201cIn-novation and Tradition in the Field of Entangled Religion and Medicine.\u201d These panels were accompanied by heated discussions over the question of \nwhether etic academic terminology needs to be aligned with the conceptual-\nizations and perceptions of the actual actors in the field.  \nOne argument in favor of such an alignment can be found in a working \npaper by Krause et al. (2012) on medical diversity, mentioned above. In it, the authors argue that talking of systems (of medical traditions) obstructs the view of emic conceptions that are characterized by overlapping, mutual in-\nfluences, etc., and of activities that are guided by the appropriation of various \npractices to individual needs without distinguishing between religious or medical therapies (ibid: 17\u201318). \nIn contrast, we argue that it is important to maintain a distinction between \netic and emic perspectives. Academic research should not stop at describing  Introduction  | 17 \nemic self -perceptions in the field but should also provide analytical etic sec-\nond- and third order observations (cp. Luhmann 1990b). 6 One question at \nstake is whether it is acceptable to label concepts and practices \u201creligious\u201d in \ncases where the respective actors disagree with this classification? Is it not \nthe responsibility of the researcher to acknowledge this self-positioning and \ntake the emic perspective seriously? \n \n2.1  Emic Perspectives  \n \nHowever, what does \u201ctaking the emic perspective seriously\u201d mean? \nEvery self-perception is conditioned by particular contexts, for instance \nby economic aspects: for example, health insurance covers the cost of medi-\ncal treatments, but not religious ones. Some political contexts support self-\nlabeling as non-religious, for example, as part of the public education system, whereas others support self-labeling as religious, for example, to obtain the \nbenefits granted to religious institutions. Besides, prestige is an issue: what \ndoes it mean to be viewed as religious in a particular society or social milieu, and is it advantageous or not? Also, what kind of positioning does it entail? Depending on the social milieu, being \u201cspiritual,\u201d for example, can have a higher value than being \u201creligious.\u201d \nTherefore, self-perceptions teach us a lot about the contexts in which the \nrespective actors are engaged. Besides, the dependence of self-perceptions on these conditions illustrates their relativity\u2014that is, perceptions may vary according to the contextual conditions of different actors. \nIn our opinion, this is one reason why the academic perspective of the \nStudy of Religion should not be expected to merely reproduce emic views and self-perceptions. Apart from the relativity of emic perspectives men-\ntioned above, which perception should be considered authoritative, that of \nthe specialists or those of ordinary people? For the specialists, a healing prac-tice may be imbued with \u201cspiritual\u201d aspects, whereas patients may perceive the same practice as purely \u201cmedical\u201d (cp. Pattathu). Furthermore, the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n6  In many cases we find scholarly reflection in the field itself, fo r example, anthro-\nposophic medicine, or scientific research on the effects of kanp \u014d medicine or \nAyurveda by their respective practitioners.  18 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens and Monika Schrimpf   \nresearcher must be careful not to slip into a paternalistic habitus by portray-\ning him- or herself as a spokesperson for the \u201cemic voice\u201d. 7 \n \n2.2  Etic Perspectives  \n The same plurality characterizes etic academic perspectives, which are also determined by the specific contextual conditions and frames of reference pro-vided by their respective academic disciplines. For example, academics make use of reflective concepts that produce specific differentiations, such \nas that between \u201creligion\u201d and \u201cmedicine.\u201d  \nThe Study of Religion depends upon such abstract analytical concepts in \norder to make statements about its topic and be able to conduct comparative \nresearch. The relevance of comparison as a basic research method in the Study of Religion has been emphasized from the beginnings of the discipline (cp. Wach 1924) to the present day (cp. Freiberger 2018). Only on the basis \nof comparison can generalized concepts\n8 be developed and constantly re-\nvised (or \u201crectified\u201d in Freiberger\u2019s terms) in order to make non-exemplary \nstatements about religions. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n7  This habitus is also a critical topic in various feminist discourses. For example, \nKawahashi and Kobayashi critici ze a patronizing attitude towards women in con-\ntemporary Japanese religions: \u201cAnother issue is the attitude shown by some schol-ars of taking non -Western women under their wing, as though somehow acting as \nthose women\u2019s patron, and there is a danger that suc h attitudes may in effect con-\nstitute complicity in maintaining patriarchal religious structures.\u201d (Kawahashi and \nKobayashi 2017: 3) On the other hand, there are various examples of joint author-\nship on the basis of a dialogical relationship, cp. L\u00fcddeckens and Karanjia 2011, \nand Ari and Jebens 2015.  \n8  As Mohn explains, when we use the term \u201cgeneralized concepts, \u201d we must be \naware that \u201c[u]niversality is always a cultural, linguistic, and socially constructed claim on \u2018the general\u2019 that can be raised differently even by speakers of a shared \ncultural context.\u201d Original wording: \u201cUniversalit\u00e4t ist immer eine kulturelle, \nsprachliche, gesellschaftlich konstruierte Inanspruchnahme des Allgemeinen, die \nvon vielen Sprechern selbst eines geteilten kulturellen Kontext es unterschiedlich \nbehauptet werden kann.\u201d (Mohn 2012: 307)  And, given the diversity of compared \ncases, it is impossible to find general terms on a meta -level that correspond to \neach individual case.   Introduction  | 19 \nAnother disciplinary framework in the Study of Religion results from the \nprocess in which religion as the object of its research is produced. 9 Besides, \nacademic perspectives are strongly influenced by the respective political \nconditions in which research is conducted: some fields of research are better \nfunded than others, and these trends are constantly changing. All these con-\nditions provide framings for academic positions that are quite different from those on the emic level. Etic perspectives are therefore determined by partic-ular contextual conditions differently from emic perspectives. Hence it is consistent to acknowledge the difference in perspectives without ascribing a higher value to one over the other.  \n  \nBIBLIOGRAPHY  \n Ari, Alex Yapua/Jebens, Holger (2015): Storibuk Pairundu.

This distinction developed into an institu-tional separation, which has proved problematic for African patients, who expect the previous unity of religious and medical aspects from their healers but are increasingly \noffered a medicalized, i.e. secular version of \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d instead. There are \ndifferent factors contributing to this discrepancy. For orthodox Muslims, Christian \nmissionaries, and colonial doctors, while the use of herbs was acceptable, rituals con-trolling or addressing spirits mostly was not. Following the World Health Organiza-tion and the concept of \u201calternative medicine,\u201d substances and experts came to be regulated by the state or scientifically researched  in accordance with \u201cbiomedical\u201d \nnotions of efficacy and safety. Thus, elements that could be clas sified as religious by \nboth functionalist and non -functionalist theories of religion were increasingly ex-\ncluded, first in external perceptions and research, and later in legislation and social reality.  \n \n  24 | Walter Bruchhausen  \n1  INTRODUCTION  \n \nHealing services referring to African traditions are in great demand in sub-\nSaharan Africa, and national as well as international bodies are trying to reg-\nulate and promote the field. This poses the question of whether the demands of the local population and activities on a political level truly refer to the same thing. The evidence presented in this article suggests that what sick people and their relatives are mostly looking for from such services, which they do not find in government health facilities, is related to what could be \ncalled \u201creligious\u201d in most notions of the term. However, international and \ngovernmental health policies and scientific activities are dominated by tendencies to minimize or even exclude precisely such aspects. Concepts of religion, whose \u201cuse\u201d here is clarified below, can be regarded as one of the central criteria in distinguishing between local and national or international views of what African traditions have to offer in treating illness.  \nThe fact that internationally and locally organized religion, especially \n\u201cenchanted Christianity\u201d in Pentecostalism and charismatic Catholicism (Gifford 2015: 13\u201368; 107\u2013124), has taken over much healing in Africa is well known and has been intensively researched. Whereas my previous stud-ies on East Africa have concentrated on the influence of local religious prac-tices and of Christian missions on the development of traditional forms of \nhealing (Bruchhausen 2009), the present contribution will mainly consider \nthe national and international political factors that have changed and even created \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d as a mainly medical activity, instead of the previous practice in which the medical and religious aspects were fused. The focus will therefore be much more on the \u201cmedicalization\u201d of healing than on its religious reformulation. In a global perspective, the focus on medical-\nization is also justified by the fact that, in both national and international \npolitics, there were far more forces turning African healing into medicine than into religion. Thus, this article offers a fresh and substantiated look at the forces that are driving the religious aspects out of the practice of \u201ctradi-tional healers,\u201d seeking to go beyond the master narrative of an allegedly irresistible secularization in dealing with disease.  \nThis difference between local hopes and practices involving the religious \naspects on the one hand and the political or scientific interest in minimizing such aspects on the other constitutes the starting point for this study. The argument will be substantiated through limited reference to ethnographic Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 25 \n \nfindings in order to illustrate the religious functions in this context and \nthrough an extended analysis of documents from different periods and or-ganizations in order to show the various ways in which these functions have been excluded. \nAfter an introduction to the terms, methods and materials used, I will \nsummarize the present practice of consulting non-biomedical experts in the region of my ethnographic fieldwork in south-eastern Tanzania. \nIn the following, the difference between the local and the (inter)national \nwill be demonstrated and explained in several ways, since monocausal views must be dismissed as outdated accounts of complex social processes. In my \nfirst explanation I will refer to comparable issues surrounding non-biomedi-\ncal practices in Europe. For comparison and self-reflection, and to induce an awareness of interaction in the sense of an entangled history, current Euro-pean attitudes towards such practices are briefly sketched and related to the situation in East Africa. A second way of explaining the difference between local demand and the political neglect of the religious dimension in healing \nis to provide a historical account of how European intrusions altered percep-\ntions and practices during colonial rule. There are different pathways to ac-count for the impact of foreign approaches on African healing, scientific re-search, international health policies, and territorial legislation respectively. \nBefore political independence, colonial administrators and academ ic re-\nsearchers in both the natural and the social sciences increasingly noticed and \nalso practiced a distinction between herbal medicine and spiritual practices. \nAfter Tanzania\u2019s independence in 1960, two different new approaches emerged to regulating the development of \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d: the poli-cies of the World Health Organization (WHO) internationally, and Tanza-nian national legislation on health professions and \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d. Thus, studying the influences on healing practices in East Africa must in-\nclude colonial and current legislation, international and national health poli-\ncies, scientific research and neoliberal commodification. Although these globalized and globalizing influences point towards the increasing functional differentiation of such distinct systems as medicine, law, science, education, politics, and religion (Luhmann 1999), these influences have encountered lo-cal resistance, often inspired by global movements, against the strict func-\ntional separation of healing and religion, l ike mystical Sufism in Islam and \nPentecostalism and other charismatic movements within the mainstream \nChristian churches. 26 | Walter Bruchhausen  \nThe final section before the conclusion returns to the present, to the re-\ncent Traditional and Alternative Medicines Act in Tanzania, and its impact \non the religious aspects of healing. \n \n \n2  CONCEPTS, METHODS AND DATA  \n \nApplying terms of European origin and highly contested meanings such as \u201creligion\u201d or \u201cmedicine\u201d to African social phenomena is a major challenge \nthat has long been debated in anthropology, theology, and missionary studies \n(Dilger et al. 2004). This is especially the case where the impact of complex European terms, in this case religion and medicine, constitutes the object of study, as in this article. The only meaningful solution to this epistemic prob-lem seems to be an understanding informed by social constructivism: medi-cine and religion are what they are for the participants in the particular social \nconstruction of reality. This implies that, before the introduction of te rms \nexpressing the Muslim distinction between tiba  and dini (two Swahili words \nof Arabic origin) or the European distinction between \u201cmedicine\u201d and \u201creli-\ngion,\u201d there might not have been anything like such differences for the in-habitants of the East African coast. However, it would excessively ethnocen-tric and arrogant to deny that Africans had what European observers called \nreligion and medicine, as in the work of certain theological and scientific \nauthors in the early colonial period (Bruchhausen/Roelcke 2000), before the debates emerged over concepts like \u201cprimitive religion\u201d (Evans-Pritchard 1965) and \u201cprimitive medicine\u201d (Ackerknecht 1942). The dilemma is obvi-ous: subjecting African practices to European definitions could ultimately lead to one endorsing the neo-colonialist statement that they do not have such \ninstitutions, whereas using only the terms of the particular tradition would \nmake translation and, especially, cooperation between the representatives of different societies or cultural traditions impossible. Therefore, the path to more shared, globally applicable definitions must be taken, even though it always risks introducing distinctions not yet known to the society in question. The debates between universalism and particularism, between liberalism and \ncommunitarianism, in political and moral philosophy revolve precisely \naround this dilemma. \nOne of the solutions to this dilemma is to use notions that carry as broad \na meaning as possible in the case in question. Thus, in such contexts Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 27 \n \n\u201cmedicine\u201d is not only defined by what medical doctors or the practice taught \nat university does, for which the term \u201cbiomedicine\u201d has been introduced in anthropology (Bruchhausen 2011a)\u2014it may also refer to any activity that deals explicitly or mainly with preventing, diagnosing, and treating illness. \nAlthough food, physical and mental exercises, and a clean environment \nmight be even more important in preventing illness or recovering from it, they are not regarded as medical in this sense, but rather as related to \u201chealth\u201d. First of all, whether practices like those of East African ritual ex-perts are called \u201cmedicine\u201d or not depends on the broadness or narrowness of the definition of \u201cmedicine,\u201d but in the long run the definition itself may \nhave effects on these practices. For mere reasons of convenience, rather than \nto emphasize any claim to supposedly proven efficacy, any foundation in biology or any static notion of tradition, the conventional, broadly estab-lished terms \u201cmedicine,\u201d \u201cbiomedicine,\u201d and \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d and their adjectives will be used in this article. We must be aware, however, that \u201cmed-icine\u201d and today also \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d are used by the respective pro-\nponents of these categories and the clients and politicians involved them-\nselves, whereas \u201cbiomedicine\u201d mostly remains a term used by external aca-demic observers. What is meant by \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d in the different discourses will remain one of the central questions. \u201cHealing\u201d is also occa-sionally used as a term indicating the broader functions of originally African activities. \nConcerning the term \u201creligion,\u201d taking a similar approach would mean \nthat some of the classical debates between, for example, functionalist and non-functionalist theories (Stausberg 2009; Luhmann 1992: 9\u201371) or be-tween definitions of religion as personal conviction, faith or experience and as social institution and doctrine (Taylor 2002), are left aside as far as possi-ble. In some beliefs and practices in African healing, relating to the spirits is \na subjective experience, as well as a social event and institution. Even if deal-\ning with disease\u2014the fundamental task of medical systems in functionalist definitions\u2014were the primary concern or function of a practice, the tasks of assisting the patient to cope with contingency and of reassuring him or her of the existence of a meaningful, trustworthy world could fulfill the function-alist criteria for religion. It could, of course, be argued that any medical prac-\ntice, including secular biomedicine, entails coping with contingency and re-\nassures by means of rituals and symbols (such as white coats or stetho-scopes), as several proponents of medical anthropology do indeed argue 28 | Walter Bruchhausen  \n(Helman 2007: 227). Yet these practices lack the open reference to a trans-\ncendent dimension which is a basic aspect of the concept of religion as ap-plied in this article. Contacting invisible personal forces, praying for their assistance and making sacrifices to them, as established in most kinds of Af-\nrican healing (Magesa 1998: 188\u2013198), would constitute religious activities \nin the understanding of most scholars of religion and probably most people in the world. The fact that early Christian missionaries and scholars called some African practices \u201cmagic,\u201d \u201cwitchcraft,\u201d \u201csuperstition,\u201d or \u201cpaganism,\u201d and thus denied them the status of religion, no longer prevents the present-day use of the term \u201creligion:\u201d indeed \u201cAfrican religion\u201d is a well-established \nconcept (Mbiti 1969). Nevertheless, such phenomena as sorcery, divination \nor spirit possession might still, by definition, be excluded from the term \u201cre-ligion\u201d by some monotheistic theologians. In African theology (Magesa 1998: 13\u201335) and religious studies, however, a less dogmatic and narrow notion of what belongs to religion seems to be common. It is precisely this notion that will be applied here. \nThe article starts with a very condensed account of my findings from \nthree years (2000\u20132003) spent studying the situation of medical pluralism in south-east Tanzania ethnographically, which I have described in detail pre-viously (Bruchhausen 2006: 143\u2013295). Interviews and participant observa-tion in consultations and rituals were conducted in the premises of about ninety \u201ctraditional healers\u201d identified for me by personal recommendation, \nthe registration lists of the district office and the healers\u2019 association, the list \nof participating healers in the workshops of a mission hospital, and finally by inquiring in villages. The same methods were also followed in four gov-ernment and three mission hospitals, as well as some health centers and dis-pensaries. Focus-group discussions in a hospital and on a healer\u2019s premises and a final survey of more than a hundred households validated the findings. \nThe major research questions were how the experts and patients understood \nthese services and where they saw their strengths and those of others, includ-ing possible reference to other experts. Ethnography forms a suitable starting point in attempts to understand all the forces that determine the religious and medical aspects of healing in East Africa. This descriptive approach, which aims at establishing the \u201cemic\u201d understanding, takes into account the fact that \nclassification into either medical or religious traits is, from a certain perspec-\ntive, a European categorical obsession rather than an identification of ele-ments in an ontological sense (Krause, Alex/Parkin 2012). Looking at actual Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 29 \n \npractices provides an understanding of the local interests and foreign influ-\nences that make possible a deeper study of the dynamics that produce and determine the present situation. It allows us to ask why such close relation-ships between needs classified as religious and medical respectively were \ndeeply changed by the encounter with the overwhelming secularizing mo-\ndernity of the Global North.  \nStudying international and national impacts on African healing is differ-\nent in kind. Doing so has involved the analysis of recent research literature and documents produced by political and administrative authorities, includ-ing the relevant public records in archives in Dar es Salaam, Oxford, Kew \nGardens (London), and Berlin, as well as contemporary medical and scien-\ntific journals and international organizations, especially the WHO.  \n  \n3  MEDICAL AND RELIGIOU S TRAITS OF HEALING \nIN CONTEMPORARY TANZ ANIA:  \nETHNOGRAPH IC FINDINGS  \n The social reality of health-related behavior, probably in most of sub- Sa-\nharan Africa, and certainly in south-east Tanzania, consists in an enormous variety of options. The majority of experts who can be consulted outside bi-omedicine are referred to as waganga wa jadi  in Swahili. Waganga derives \nfrom a Bantu verb originally meaning \u201cconnecting,\u201d but here denoting the performance of special rituals for positive outcomes. The functions of the priest in offering sacrifices and relating to invisible personal powers, of the \nmagician in divining and protecting against evil forces, and of the healer in \ncaring for the sick were not separated in this concept, which is common to large parts of Bantu-speaking Africa and beyond. Today the term waganga \non its own can be used for practitioners of both \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201cmodern\u201d medicine, that is, healers on the one hand and doctors, nurses or other bio-medical specialists on the other. Waganga wa jadi  refers to the \u201ctraditional \nsector\u201d only and is usually translated as \u201ctraditional healer,\u201d as wa jadi means \nliterally \u201cof yesterday\u201d or \u201cof the past\u201d more generally.\n1 In particular, as \nwaganga is also used for biomedical practitioners, it has taken on the medical meaning of \u201chealer.\u201d The abstract noun uganga still refers to the previous \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1  A word like destur i would rather have the connotations of \u201ctradition\u201d or \u201ccustom.\u201d  30 | Walter Bruchhausen  \nbroad range of functions. The Arabic term tiba is used for \u201cmedicine\u201d in a \nnarrow, rather European sense. Tiba ya asili , \u201cmedicine of the origin\u201d or \u201cof \nnature,\u201d is translated as \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d, while tiba ya kisasa, \u201cmedi-\ncine of today,\u201d or tiba ya hospitali , \u201chospital medicine,\u201d are used for \u201cmod-\nern medicine,\u201d that is, \u201cbiomedicine\u201d. \nThus, if one demands to speak to a mganga [singular of waganga] wa \njadi, one will be probably taken to somebody who practices a type of healing. \nYet the variety of experts that fall under this name is broad. Some of them, \nall male, behave in several ways similar to a biomedical doctor, wearing a white coat, using a stethoscope, and selling pharmaceuticals, although their \ndiagnostics do not follow the principles of a clinical examination and labor-\natory tests. If these waganga use herbal medicine, it tends to be already pul-verized and issued in small bottles originally used for injections or large con-tainers for tablets, a further reference to biomedicine. Such preparations can also be bought in small shops in towns, where long lists of diseases and other misfortunes, like problems in marriage, at school or in business, promise \nremedies against them. \nHowever, the majority of the waganga wa jadi in southeast Tanzania are \nfemale spirit mediums, who, through an initial illness, have been called by \ntheir spirit(s) to serve, especially in healing. With this type of healer, the use of roots and herbs is embedded in contact with spirits: the spirit gives the diagnosis and shows which remedies are the correct ones. Often these healers \nbecome leaders in a kind of religious group in which variations of the tradi-\ntional night-long drum dances are performed as major rituals intended to sat-isfy the spirit(s). These groups may exhibit different cultural or religious characteristics, some of which, like half-naked dress, the colors of red and black, drum rhythms, songs, and the names of spirits, belong to the African heritage. Under the influence of Islam, others resemble Sufi brotherhoods, \nwith full white dress ( galabia and head scarf), a flag of the prophet, a Koran, \ndhikr  (rhythmic breathing) as incantation, songs without drumming, and sac-\nrifices without alcohol. The reference to Islamic spirits supposedly renders \nthe originally \u201cpagan\u201d practice lawful for Muslim healers, although for or-thodox Muslims any dealing with spirits is shirk , religiously forbidden. In \nthe mostly Christian regions, the function of such groups has been taken over \nby independent African churches in which the prophets are healers who also \nlead long rituals with dancing, trances and glossolalia. Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 31 \n \nRega rdless of religious affiliation\u2014whether originally African, Islam-\nized or Christianized\u2014these consultations and rituals obviously function \nboth as religious services in the sense of contact with spiritual forces and as medical treatment by concentrating simultaneously on health problems. Yet \nwhat health problems do they address? At the end of my field research in \nsoutheast Tanzania, a questionnaire I had circulated, answered by a hundred households, clearly revealed local perceptions of the strengths and weak-nesses of the different services. The results indicated an informal but factual division of labor between biomedicine and \u201ctraditional medicine,\u201d the former being more appropriate to the somatic aspect, especially through the impact \nof chemical substances and surgery, the latter to the more psychic aspect. Yet \ninterestingly enough, scientific and political support for \u201ctraditional medi-cine\u201d points in a quite different direction that favors the bioactive substances of medicinal herbs, not coping or healing through rituals. In order to explain this tendency, we must first look at non-biomedical practices of healing in a global and historical perspective. \n \n \n4 \u201cTRADITIONAL\u201d AND \u201cC OMPLEMENTARY AND \nALTERNATIVE\u201d MEDICIN E: AFRICA AND THE \nGLOBAL NORTH  \n \n4.1  Non-biomedical H ealing in Africa and Europe  \n \nEquating African healing with European \u201cfolk medicine\u201d or \u201cnaturopathy,\u201d as various discourses have done since the late nineteenth century, produced ambiguous results regarding the religious dimension. The obvious reason is that it repeats the variety of Europe\u2019s reactions and interpretations concern-ing its own healing traditions (Ernst 2000). Conceptions of the foreign mirror \none\u2019s own preoccupations, in this case negotiating the relationship between \nreligion and medicine in the Global North (Bruchhausen 2011b). \nThe broad current interest in \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d in Africa would have \nbeen quite a surprise to Western observers in previous times. When Europe-ans\u2019 descriptions of African health care reached Europe during the colonial period, the general direction of medicine in Europe seemed to be inevitable, \na matter of course, to many of the educated: medical science would increas-\ningly govern peoples\u2019 health-related behavior, as older practices came to be 32 | Walter Bruchhausen  \nregarded as \u201cmedical superstitions\u201d or existed only in new fringe areas such \nas naturopathy and spiritual healing, in opposition to the sort of medicine represented in the universities (J\u00fctte 1996). Thus, African healing practices were categorized similarly, that is, as an irrational way of dealing with dis-\nease that would soon disappear, or, in some more sympathetic minds, as a \npossibly more natural and less materialistic way of healing (Bruch-hausen/Roelcke 2000). \nYet in Africa as in Europe, the biomedical approach, despite its undeni-\nable successes in many areas, did not conquer all areas of health care equally. The partitioning of the domain of biomedical practitioners and other forms \nof medical treatment and their experts, called \u201ctraditional\u201d for countries out-\nside Europe and \u201calternative\u201d for Europe, seems to have converged in most parts of the world: the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of severe infec-tious diseases, as well as major surgery, are mostly pursued in hospitals and pharmacies; patients with chronic or psychosomatic conditions quite often prefer to consult practitioners with a less scientific reputation. \nGiven the numbers of patients and the gravity of the health problems con-\ncerned, \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d in African countries is a far more important issue than \u201ccomplementary and alternative medicine\u201d (CAM), as it tends to be called today in the industrialized nations (Moeti 2015). Due to its central role in African societies and to the longer tradition of ethnographic work on non-European situations, academic interest in the non-scientific aspects of \nhealing developed in Africa much earlier and more widely than interest in \nthe \u201cfolk healing\u201d of Europe. But in asking how formal state control influ-ences non-biomedical practices, industrialized societies, with their fully im-plemented administrative structures, may offer some fruitful entry points to the study of regulatory activities in a globalized world. \nThe term CAM itself \u2014despite its reference to \u201cmedicine\u201d\u2014does not \nnecessarily imply a preference for either secular notions of scientifically ex-plainable effects or a utilization of religious elements such as reference to a \"spiritual world\". As governmental recognition of CAM is a concession to that variously large and heterogeneous part of the population that does not accept biomedical monopolism, the academic debate on CAM asks quite dif-ferent questions (Sharma 1992). Is it rather a sign of post-modern \u201canything \ngoes\u201d, of disappointment at the unfulfilled promises of biomedicine, of the \n\u201cre-enchantment\u201d of a secularized world, of the new consumer sovereignty, or of the increasing market-place ideology of health care? All these factors, Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 33 \n \nof course, play their role to different degrees. Although the dimensions that \nrefer to spiritual or psychological needs i.e. those discourses that address questions of ultimate causation and meaning of illness, will be at the center of this study the more economic and political factors underlying the popular-\nity of CAM must also be considered. On the whole, these factors create an \nopportunity for interpretations of CAM in terms of both secular methods based on nature and religious activities. Under the umbrella term CAM, we find anatomy-based practices like osteopathy, the pharmaceutically sophisti-cated system of homeopathy, the \u201cneo-pagan\u201d rituals of Wicca, and the Cath-olic approaches to healing of the mediaeval nun Hildegard of Bingen. Dis-\nsatisfaction and liberalization can lead in quite opposite directions. On the \npart of the patients or consumers, there does not seem to be a strong need to distinguish or even separate the material and spiritual components of CAM practices, i.e. the scientifically proven biological effects of substances and procedures on the one hand and the mobilization of healing forces beyond the causality of the sciences. \nA major aspect of a secular notion, however, is the growing demand for \nscientific research into CAM\u2019s effects that is being sponsored currently by pharmaceutical enterprises specialized in phytotherapy, foundations devoted to such therapies, and even public sick funds and private health insurance companies. Despite its much lower funding compared to research into other pharmaceuticals or into molecular and cell biology, such studies are a pub-\nlicly visible part of medical research. The economic interest in traditional \nmedicine and CAM is quite obvious and no longer concealed by reference to public service alone, as in earlier WHO documents and ethnographic studies. On the relevant WHO fact sheet for 2008, one of five \u201ckey facts\u201d about \u201ctra-ditional medicine\u201d is: \u201cHerbal medicines are the most lucrative form of tra-ditional medicine, generating billions of dollars in revenue\u201d (WHO 2008). \nThe explanation given later in the text is: \u201cHerbal treatments are the most \npopular form of traditional medicine and are highly lucrative in the interna-tional marketplace. Annual revenues in Western Europe reached US$ 5 bil-lion in 2003-2004. In China, sales of products totaled US$ 14 billion in 2005. Herbal medicine revenue in Brazil was US$ 160 million in 2007.\u201d Before the WHO turned its emphasis in this way from saving to making money from \n\u201ctraditional medicine,\u201d already in the 1990s in the United States the Eisen-\nberg studies showed the high percentage of out-of-pocket expenditure flow-ing into so-called unconventional or alternative medicine (Eisenberg 1993, 34 | Walter Bruchhausen  \n1998). National and international bodies, like the European Union or the \nWHO, try to regulate the production, distribution, and application of herbal remedies. Yet so far, no African international organization, and only a single African state, Ghana, has joined the WHO\u2019s organization in this project, the \nInternational Regulatory Cooperation for Herbal Medicines (WHO 2010). \nThere is no WHO collaboration center for traditional medicine in sub- Sa-\nharan Africa, the only one on the continent being in Khartoum. New national legislation for traditional medicine is growing in several African countries, and its effect on healing practices will be studied at the end of this article. \nThe overall effect of equating African healing with CAM in industrial-\nized nations as implied by, for example, the WHO unit for Traditional and Complementary Medicine in Geneva is its construction and classification as herbal medicine. Even when \u201ctraditional\u201d health-related practices that do not involve substances are studied in clinical trials, African practices are not in-cluded. Whereas acupuncture from the Chinese tradition, yoga from the Ayurveda, the mindfulness exercises of Buddhism, or even trances in sham-\nanism and Caribbean cults are investigated for their impacts on health, mak-\ning a scientific distinction between potentially useful plants and rituals not worth clinical study seems to be general when it comes to African healing. The religious or spiritual functions of African healing, such as the integration of experiences into an overall world view, the resulting motivations to serve others and accept misfortune, are not emphasized by its international and na-\ntional supporters.  \nHaving looked at contemporary situations and tendencies in the non-bi-\nomedical healing practices of Africa and Europe, we now need to see how \nthey can be explained by reference to the various historical influences which used to favor a biomedical interpretation and the suppression of the religious aspects and functions. \n \n4.2 The Impact of Colonialism on the Practice and \nPerception of African H ealing  \n \n4.2.1  The D istinction between the  Physical and the Spiritual \nor Religious Aspects of Healing  \n The way healing practices develop in our case\u2014whether they are tied to or are removed from religion\u2014is, of course, largely determined by the social Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 35 \n \ninstitutions that control the field. Both before and during early colonial rule, \nthese institutions worked more closely to the traditions of the local popula-tion than under the later nation state. Control was exerted in condensed set-tlements among ethnic or social groups where functional differentiation was \nlow, even in places where centralized kingdoms, colonial administrations or \nnational governments exerted some political control over a larger territory. Before the colonial and later the independent state attempted to assume the regulation of healing\u2014and in many instances long after this, even up until today\u2014communities both large and small ruled such issues. They decided how ill-health had to be approached, what standards of health were accepta-\nble or unacceptable, and which kinds of healing should be chosen. Religious \nfeatures such as contacts with spirits, sacrifices, and reconciliation were in-dispensable aspects of such healing practices (Sempebwa 1983). \nThe modern state, both colonial and independent, did not feel responsible \nfor African healing traditions in the same way as it did for biomedical ser-vices. This left traditional health expertise in a peculiar situation, with less \ncontrol but also less recognition. But the colonial conquest, accompanied as \nit was by more Christian missions, ethnographic studies, and preventive as well as c urative medical activities, had changed African healing by introduc-\ning fundamental European distinctions: science versus humanities, natural versus supernatural. Some practices, especially the use of herbs, were re-garded as acceptable by Christian theology and by doctors, while others were \ndenounced as mere \u201cbelief\u201d or as \u201csuperstition.\u201d In doing so, the encounter \nwith Europe established a marked difference between those aspects of Afri-can healing practices that are researched in socio-cultural studies like anthro-pology and those aspects that are evaluated by scientific investigation. This distinction affected politics and administration, criminal law, and the popu-lation concerned in both early and more recent settings. Thus, this difference \nmust be considered central to all the discourses being examined here, even \nthough\u2014or perhaps because\u2014it is certainly a product of colonial categori-zation. \nThis distinction between the physical and spiritual or religious aspects is \nalso essential for a nuanced assessment of present-day claims in Tanzania that \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d had been forbidden under colonial rule but has \nnow been legalized. This prompts us to ask which parts and aspects had been \nopposed then but are being promoted today, a differentiation in which the separation between the physically effective and more religious constituents 36 | Walter Bruchhausen  \nof African healing has the central function. The common view of semi-offi-\ncial statements and published opinion is that it is only since 1968 that \u201ctradi-tional medicine\u201d has been politically accepted in Tanzania, that it had been suppressed earlier, and that official recognition of the potential of \u201ctraditional \nmedicine\u201d is a necessary compensation for colonial injustice (Goergen et al. \n2001: 4). This poses the question of how much of this generalizing statement is due to the African nationalist rhetoric that has dominated public discourses for several decades, and how much of it can be substantiated by evidence. What did colonial rule want to do, and what did it do to African ways of healing? Here the definition of what counts as \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d be-\ncomes crucial.  \nIf one takes the broad meaning of an anthropological approach\u2014that is, \nattempts to arrive at an \u201cemic\u201d view referring to the notions and functions of \nthe tradition al experts in their own society\u2014colonial rule has been certainly \ndisastrous for the African population\u2019s ability to cope with all kinds of afflic-tion, including ill-health. The role of these experts went far beyond private \nproblems: they also judged certain general developments within their com-\nmunity to be dangerous and initiated counter-measures, such as the exclusion or reconciliation of allegedly harmful individuals (\u201cwitches\u201d) and even up-risings against the colonial rulers in cases of unbearable colonial burdens like new taxes or other orders. Motivating or even leading resistance by means of prophetic messages such as liberation from the evil of colonialism with the \nassistance of spiritual forces, especially in the Maji Maji war, brought these \nritual experts into violent conflict with the colonial rulers and led to their persecution, including even their execution by hanging (Beez 2005). How and how deeply colonial agents and actions destroyed the traditional ways of preserving and restoring health have been demonstrated by Steven Feierman (1986: 206-210) with interesting examples showing that many health- related \nfunctions of the pre-colonial authorities among the Shambalaa-speaking peo-ple in northeast Tanganyika were forcibly brought to an end without relevant substitutes being made available.  \nIf, however, one starts from the much narrower, biomedical notion of \n\u201ctraditional medicine\u201d that most African politicians and officials also refer to today, the extent of the colonial-era destruction must necessarily be judged \ndifferently. In this perspective on the treatment and prevention of disease, \none would have to distinguish\u2014as both colonial and modern legislation does\u2014therapeutic practices related to medicinal plants from the use of spirits Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 37 \n \nand the fighting of \u201cwitchcraft,\u201d as colonial discourses constructed practices \nof controlling evil (Langwick 2011: 46\u201357; Bruchhausen 2007). In this per-spective, the colonial and post-colonial impacts on the spiritual-psychother-apeutic and herbalist aspects of the healers\u2019 activities were both quite differ-\nent. When waganga  were banned and persecuted, it was their function as \npolitical or religious authorities that was the issue of concern, especially their \nsocial, moral, and religious importance as experts in the management of af-fliction by detecting the guilty; that is, by \u201cwitch-finding,\u201d which was for-bidden by the Witchcraft Ordinance of 1928, still in force today (Mesaki 2009, Tanzania 1998). Yet how did the Witchcraft Ordinance affect tradi-\ntional healing? Was it meant to suppress all \u201csupernatural\u201d activities indis-\ncriminately, or was it applied to troubles only? \nAt least in southeast Tanganyika, the British administration tried to apply \nthe Witchcraft Ordinance in accordance with local public opinion. Initially, it did not feel that punishing witch-finders was absolutely necessary in order to prevent the exploitation of what they regarded as a credulous population. \nSome years later, in the 1930s, and contrary to the wording of the Witchcraft \nOrdinance (Cole/Denison 1964: 254\u2013255), the Provincial Commissioners were inclined to distinguish between \u201cbenevolent witchcraft\u201d or the \u201cbenev-olent removal of witchcraft\u201d or \u201cuganga\u201d  on the one hand and \u201cuchawi\u201d  as \n\u201cblack art\u201d on the other (Guise Williams 1933; Kitching 1937). In 1933 a n \nAssistant District Officer in Liwale requested that therapeutically acting \n\u201cwitch doctors\u201d should not be imprisoned, even if a lethal outcome could be \nattributed to their practice, as long as they did not cause any social trouble (Beck 1970: 140). Some years later, even the Colonial Office in London raised the necessity of distinguishing between allegedly benevolent and de-structive \u201cwitchcraft\u201d (Keith 1938: 2). This attitude seems to have become the prevailing British policy in the south of Tanganyika, as can be seen in the \nrecently published autobiography of a former district officer in Lindi and \nMasasi in the late 1950s. He notes major differences between the wording of the ordinance and the local administrative practice of its application:  \n \n\u201cThe offici al view of witchcraft was embodied in the Witchcraft Ordinance; I do not \nrecollect whether it was the law itself or the practical interpretation thereof which was \ncuriously ambiguous and liberal, but it was one or the other. White magic or uganga, \nin effect \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d employing herbal remedies and psychology, tended to be beneficial and therapeutic even though accompanied by a great deal of mumbo -38 | Walter Bruchhausen  \njumbo and theatre, and was acceptable. [Then he gives examples of its use by British \nofficers, inclu ding the famous police investigations by Nguvumali.]  Witchcraft or \nuchawi  however was another matter, and anyone who purported to practice it or who \nmaliciously accused others of doing so, was liable to severe penalties in addition to \nalmost certain banish ment to a remote part of the country; such w as the strength of \nsuperstition \u2014or belief.\u201d (Barton 2004: 142)  \n \nConcerning the restricted European or biomedical notion of \u201cmedicine,\u201d ac-cording to which \u201cmedicine\u201d comprises measures intended for the good of an individual only, the British administration was guided by the approbation \nof the local population and tolerated the practice of \u201cemploying herbal rem-\nedies and psychology.\u201d However, when it came to the much broader African concept of what ritual experts are responsible for, which includes accusing and fighting witches, local support for counter-magic was not recognized by the representatives of the colonial state. Therefore, it can be concluded that the general destruction of \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d had obviously not been the \nintention of colonial officers who had to enforce the Witchcraft Ordinance in \nthe south of Tanganyika: it was only directed against witch-finding, not against the treatment of the sick. Nevertheless, this ordinance has certainly destroyed much of what anthropologists would consider the previous cultural or social system related to health. It marked the transition from a pre-colonial system in which traditional authorities fought all those who were perceived \nas threatening the well-being of the community to a colonial system that \nmade distinctions according to the functional systems of modern Western societies, here \u201claw\u201d and \u201cmedicine\u201d. \nGiven this separation of the \u201cmedical\u201d aspect from the other previous \nfunctions of ritual experts, it could be argued that the effects of the Witchcraft Ordinances did not destroy \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d but actually created it by \nmedicalizing it. Rituals for treating the sick were acceptable to the admin-\nistration, but rituals leading to accusations against others were not. Beyond the administration\u2019s acceptance of herbal medicine, the application of the Witchcraft Ordinances declared even rituals referring to the \u201csupernatural\u201d lawful as long as the purpose was restoring or preserving health\u2014and doing so without causing social conflict. At least some of the religious functions of \ntraditional healing, like placating sacrifices and incantations to angry ances-\ntors or other spirits, although not previous practices like fighting evil human beings, could be allowed to survive in the eyes of the colonial rulers.  Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 39 \n \n4.2.2  The Impact of Scientific Interest  in the  \n  Tanzanian Context  \n \nRegarding those activities of waganga wa jadi , the \u201ctraditional healers,\u201d that \nthe Tanzanian state seeks to promote and legalize today, mainly the applica-tion of herbal knowledge, there have never been any government attempts to prohibit them. This is even one area where the institutions imported from Europe showed more than just tolerance for African healing, one where herbal medicines were also actively promoted, reflecting a marked prefer-ence for the material over the spiritual aspects. During and after German co-\nlonial rule such knowledge was investigated with government support and \nregarded as potentially valuable (Bruchhausen/Roelcke 2000: 78\u201383). As far back as 1895, the director of health services in German East Africa, Dr Al-exander Becker, had called on his widely dispersed medical officers to study native healing methods, including \u201cdevil dances,\u201d but mainly for them to send in specimens of medicinal plants (Becker 1896: 647\u201348). In 1969, in a \nsimilar circular to the Regional Medical Officers, the Tanzanian Chief Med-\nical Officer in the Ministry of Health requested \u201cresearch into indigenous methods of therapeutics\u201d to be conducted (Institute of Traditional Medicine ca. 2002: 2), thus following the model of his first colonial predecessor, prob-ably without realizing it. Only an initiative of the medical faculty of the na-tional university five years later led to the permanent institutionalization of \nsuch research through the establishment of a Traditional Medicine Research \nUnit divided into the five sections of botany, chemistry, pharmacology, so-cial anthropology, and clinical evaluation. As can be seen from the labels for these sections, the major tasks of this institution were the collection and sci-entific or medical investigation of medicinal plants and the study of other functions of \u201ctraditional healers\u201d. Whereas, after the unit\u2019s promotion to an \ninstitute in 1991, \u201cBotany and Agronomy,\u201d \u201cPharmacology and Toxicol-\nogy,\u201d and \u201cChemistry of Natural Products\u201d became departments of their own, social anthropology remained something of an appendix. The scientific reason for this focus seemed obvious in the East African discourse, as one Kenyan pharmacist succinctly expressed it: \u201cTraditional medicine, whether involving the supernatural or not, depends very much on the use of plants\u201d \n(Tessema 1980: 48\u201354). The WHO African Regional Office in Congo Braz-\nzaville is especially keen on reformulating African healing as herbal medi-cine within the WHO\u2019s Traditional Medicine Strategy.  40 | Walter Bruchhausen  \nWhereas national research and the promotion of \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d \nboth focus on herbal medicine, the ritual dimension did not remain com-\npletely unconsidered. Here, however, the main approach was to define this area as involving a cultural, and neither a medical nor a religious heritage. \nThus, at the beginning of the 1980s the Tanzanian Ministry of Culture pro-\nmoted the relevant drumming rituals in public by organizing competitions and studying songs and dances (Janzen 1992: 25). This was facilitated by the fact that the drum dances overlap to a certain degree, whether for pleasure, celebrations, or protection and healing. Not only do they have the general name of ngoma in common, which can be qualified by adding phrases like \nya majini  (for spirits) or ya kutibu  (for healing) as religious or medical. The \nkind of music and dance and the musicians involved can also be regarded as largely similar and/or even as the same. The only elements specific to healing were the shape of the drums, the costumes, and other symbols, and of course the texts and the individual melodies and rhythms. Yet not only ngoma , but \nalso waganga  were in principle officially assigned to the government\u2019s cul-\ntural sector instead of to medicine or religion. Up until the recent legal change, their registration was with the District Cultural Officer ( Afisa utuma-\nduni), not the District Health Officer ( Afisa afya), or else they were registered \nas religious congregations. Until 2002, too, it was the Cultural Office that issued permits to practice as a mganga after payment of the obligatory annual \nfee. \nSumming up our findings on the influence of colonial as well as post-\ncolonial administration and research, what today the WHO and national pol-iticians call \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d\u2014mostly a kind of naturopathy\u2014has not been administratively suppressed in East African countries, but in light of public demand it has been tolerated and even promoted. Yet, regarded as a whole, the precolonial sociocultural and religious function of healing has cer-\ntainly been disrupted, especially by the activities of colonial states and Chris-\ntian missions against those ritual experts who acted as political leaders, witch -finders or traditional priests. The difference between speaking of a \nwhole social institution, such as the public protection of well-being, and looking at different kinds of healing practices is decisive in judging the de-structive effects of the clash between African societies and the colonial state. \nThe pre-colonial social system, where notions of the common good (includ-\ning health and good relations with spirits) were widely shared between the general population and the authorities, had to give way to the rule of a Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 41 \n \ngovernment with functional systems (including public health and medicine) \nwhose experts tried to convince people of the validity of their relevant mes-sages and institutions. Thus, this transition from a purely African, often eth-nically restricted healing and health maintenance system, which was an in-\nseparable part of a religiously constituted social order and world view, to the \nsituation in the colonial and independent state characterized by massive Eu-ropean influence was not just a matter of a change in the ruling elite. Regu-lating healing experts and health was no longer just a local matter of clans, villages or ethnic groups\u2014it acquired a geographically and socially much wider, though more focused dimension which had to deal with nationwide or \neven global functional systems like science, medicine, and law. The national \nand international agendas on health entered local choices and decision-mak-ing even in a field such as this that touched on questions of cultural and reli-gious identity.  \n \n4.3  The Impact of International and N ational  \n Health P olicies  \n 4.3.1  WHO  Policies on Traditional Healers and M edicine: \nUsing  Healers or Integrating Indigenous K nowledge? \n Whereas for the colonial and post-colonial state the main reason for tolerat-ing African healing, including its religious components, had been political expediency\u2014namely respecting the wishes of the population\u2014the WHO had a different motivation that resulted in yet another concept of \u201ctraditional medicine.\u201d And, as in the case of the questionable colonial suppression of \n\u201ctraditional medicine,\u201d the usual narrative concerning the WHO\u2019s relation-\nship with \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d must also be questioned, or at least distin-\nguished. This common view of the WHO\u2019s policy on \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d seems to be that, since the Alma Ata Declaration of 1978 proclaiming \u201cHealth for all\u2014by the Year 2000\u201d (WHO and UNICEF 1978), \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d should be integrated into national programs of primary health care \n(PHC). A closer reading of the declaration, however, tells a different story, \nas it speaks of the use of \u201ctraditional practitioners\u201d within biomedically con-ceived programs only, not of the use of \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d as a potential healing resource. While the first suggests complete subjection to 42 | Walter Bruchhausen  \nbiomedicine, the second could entail religious functions such as the incanta-\ntion of personal invisible forces as well. \nThe only section in the Declaration of Alma Ata that mentions the tradi-\ntional sector argues that \u201ctraditional medical practitioners and birth attend-\nants\u201d should be recruited as \u201cimportant allies\u201d or even as \u201ccommunity health \nworkers\u201d through relevant \u201ctraining\u201d (WHO and UNICEF 1978: 63). It ex-plicitly argues that the \u201chigh social standing\u201d and \u201cconsiderable local influ-ence\u201d of these persons\u2014that is, the esteem they enjoy among the general public\u2014could be used in PHC. This was in accordance with a previous res-olution of the World Health Assembly (WHA) of 1976, which encouraged \n\u201cthe development of health teams trained to meet the health needs of popu-\nlations, including health workers for primary health care, and taking into ac-count, where appropriate, the manpower reserve constituted by those prac-ticing traditional medicine\u201d (WHA 1976). Related to this medical attempt to integrate healers are some studies in medical anthropology that tried to dis-tinguish two types of healing (Foster/Anderson 1978: 53\u201365; Young 1983). \nOne, the \u201cinternalizing\u201d or \u201cnaturalistic\u201d type that recognized the relevant \npathological processes within the body and treated them accordingly\u2014for example, with herbal medicines\u2014was judged compatible with state medi-cine. The other, the \u201cexternalizing\u201d or \u201cpersonalistic\u201d type, identified evil forces outside the individual as causing the illness and sought to counter them by means of magical objects, rituals and prayers. The practitioners of such \nforms of healing were to be left outside the governmental healthcare system, \nas their world view did not recommend them for co-operation. In anthropol-ogy, it could still be debated whether pure examples of each type exist at a ll, \nbut the distinction as such was certainly influential\u2014not only in health poli-cies\u2014and it contributed to the dichotomy between medicine and religion in \nacademic, political, and public perceptions. As the anthropologist Robert \nPool noted, this anthropological conceptualization was part of a major shift \nfrom religion to medicine: the same experts, rituals, and objects that had ear-lier been studied by the anthropology of religion were now often investigated by medical anthropologists (Dilger et al. 2004). \nHowever, the attempt to use traditional practitioners as mainly preventive \nhealth-workers without government pay proved illusory. These plans on the \npart of the biomedical experts who dominated the Alma Ata Declaration \nmostly failed since communities were not ready to respect and pay healers for biomedically designed preventive medicine, and in any case the majority Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 43 \n \nof healers rejected being placed at the bottom of a hierarchical national \nhealthcare system in place of their former independent authority and w ere \nthus saved from being incorporated into a completely medicalized setting. Such incorporation would have probably meant the end of any ritual activity, \nwhereas avoiding close supervision by biomedical functionaries preserved \nspaces for religious functions.  \nAt about the same time, politicians from countries with strong political \nconcepts and institutions of \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d that entered into their na-tional identities, especially China and India, convinced the WHO to adopt a policy on \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d itself. This policy was not related to health \npolicies in general, nor to other health programs, and therefore the important \nspiritual or religious dimension could have been accepted. However, the op-posite tendency became quite influential instead, that is, the definition of tra-ditional medicine as the administration of substances. The first relevant doc-ument of the WHA on traditional medicine, dated 1978, focused on medici-nal plants (WHA 31.33). In 1989, another resolution on \u201ctraditional medi-\ncine\u201d elaborated research into medicinal plants and their regulation (WHA \n1989). Two years later, the WHA demanded a \u201csubstantial increase in na-tional and international funding and support [\u2026] to enable \u2018traditional med-icine\u2019 to take its rightful place in health care,\u201d as well as \u201cthe use of scientif-ically proven, safe and effective traditional remedies to reduce national drug costs\u201d (WHA 1991). Medicinal plants were at the heart of the strategy on \n\u201ctraditional medicine.\u201d \nWhen, in the mid-1990s, the two strands, namely the use of traditional \nhealers in a strongly preventive biomedical healthcare system and the use of \n\u201ctraditional medicine\u201d as a curative resource, merged, the role of herbal med-icine in programs was strengthened further. The revitalization of training schedules for \u201ctraditional practitioners,\u201d promoted by the WHO in the 1990s \nand still referring to their use as \u201cprimary health care workers\u201d (WHO 1991), \ndemonstrates a characteristic shift in the curriculum: those aspects that refer directly to traditional herbal medicine, such as the secure identification and hygienic storage of herbal remedies, receive attention first. Actions such as referral to hospital or supervising the construction and use of latrines\u2014that is, the classic tasks of the village health -worker\u2014come last in the list of sub-\njects on training courses (WHO 1995: 64\u201365). In the WHO\u2019s \u201ctraditional medicine strategy 2002\u20132005\u201d (WHO 2005), it was the aim of promoting 44 | Walter Bruchhausen  \n\u201ctraditional medicine\u201d as a therapeutic resource for natural remedies, not of \nusing its manpower in PHC, that received the most visible expression. \nThus, it can be said that the turn to the PHC policy since the 1970s cer-\ntainly did not promote African healing in all its aspects, as it favored those \nelements that were regarded as compatible with science-based medicine and \nignored those others that were regarded as depending on thinking attributed to the realm of religion. Therefore, medical development experts even warned that integration into the national healthcare system would lead to the \u201cdestruction of traditional medicine\u201d (Diesfeld 1989: 90\u201391). If one wanted to save African healing from losing its overall importance for the population, \nthe option of leaving \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d as far as possible out of the ad-\nministrative and judicial system and trusting local mechanisms of social con-trol instead had much to commend it.  4.3.2  East African Legislation: Local and National Control of \n\u201cTraditional M edicine\u201d  \n Given the importance of local criteria for local practice, the way the colonial and later the independent state regulated African healing combined control at the local and governmental levels. In doing so, at least in theory, the inter-est of the population in services close to their own religious traditions could be made compatible with the obligation of the state to protect its citizens \nagainst harmful practices. Following the example of Western countries from \nmedieval or early modern times, government responsibility for health was especially a matter of the legal status of health practitioners.\n2 The relevant \nmeasures were introduced in the British mandated territory in 1937 with the Medical Practitioners and Dentist Ordinance Act, the first legal regulation of the health professions, modelled after European legislation. This Act forbade \nany medical practice without registration or license, but explicitly exempted \nsuch persons whose expertise in healing was acknowledged by their respec-tive communities and whose healing activities were confined to their com-munities (Tanganyika Territory 1937: 409). Thus, the Act did not qualify the method of healing as natural or \u201csupernatural,\u201d but took the assessment of the local community as the decisive criterion regarding the qualification of \npractitioners. In 1963, the legislation of the independent state did not alter \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n2  For the same aspect in the context of India see Rageth, this volume.  Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 45 \n \nthe section on local medicine and merely changed the reference to colonial \ninstitutions such as \u201cthe Crown,\u201d \u201cDirector of Medical Services,\u201d and \u201creg-isters of health professionals\u201d (Tanganyika 1963). Yet there is substantial reason to doubt whether this official \u201crestriction on traditional healing,\u201d \nwhich confined it to a local practice, had been enforced in all the decades \nthat followed up until new legislation was passed in 2002 (Harrington 1999: 226). \nIn 1976 the regional Africa office of the WHO in Brazzaville also defined \na traditional healer as \u201ca person who is recognized by the community in \nwhich he lives as competent to provide health care by using vegetable, ani-\nmal and mineral substances and certain other methods based on the social, \ncultural and religious background\u201d (WHO 1978: 9). The reference to prac-tices that do not rely on substances and physical intervention is remarkable but remained without consequence for WHO policies on Africa. The special legal arrangement for \u201ca system of therapeutics according to local methods [\u2026] in a bona fide practice\u201d was also set out in Tanzania\u2019s Pharmaceutical \nand Poisons Act of 1978 (Tanzania 1978, Part VI, 68 [1]). The following \nregulation, however, emphasized explicitly that it does not give permission to produce and/or distribute substances to persons outside the respective community, to sell or supply lethal quantities or preparations, or to add self-manufactured substances to any preparations of other systems of treatment. Thus, the goal was still that traditional remedies should only be accepted as \nlocal practices subject to the immediate judgement of local civil society. \nOnly after the launch of these WHO programs for \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d \n(WHO 1987: 149\u201351) did this rather defensive legislative approach change \nslightly, culminating in Tanzania\u2019s Traditional and Alternative Medicines Act of 2002, which paved the way to the active promotion and regulation of \u201ctraditional medicine.\u201d The old rule that there has to be a relationship with a \nlocal public was partly maintained in as much as under this new law a \u201ctra-\nditional health practitioner\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who is recognized by the community in which he lives as competent to provide health care\u201d (Tanzania 2002: 3). This also allows such practitioners to practice religious ways of healing if the community regards this as adequate. However, the old re-striction on practicing healing in one\u2019s own community alone is now omitted \nas long as the other regulations are respected. For like the so-called \u201calterna-\ntive health practitioner\u201d (with formal training in the respective therapeutic system), now the \u201ctraditional health practitioner\u201d is also allowed (i.e. without 46 | Walter Bruchhausen  \nformally recognized training) to practice country-wide and in all groups, pro-\nvided the appropriate official permission has been granted (Tanzania 2002: 21). Where there are strong ties to local religion\u2014perhaps in the forms of ethnically bound spirits\u2014shrines fixed to a grave or prayers in a local lan-\nguage, these forms are likely to disappear in cases of healing far from home. \nThe old practice of healing outside one\u2019s own ethnic and religious group, which rapidly increased with urbanization and growing mobility, is now en-couraged even by law. \nThe official governmental view, as expressed by the person responsible \nin the Ministry of Health, is that the new law of 2002 has taken the \u201ctradi-\ntional healer\u201d and visits to him or her out of the \u201cunderground,\u201d from being \n\u201cmost [\u2026] an illegal thing\u201d (Langwick 2011: 74). In contrast to this view \u201cfrom above,\u201d the local population\u2019s experience\u2014as a subaltern perspec-tive\u2014was somewhat different, as even before the new Act healers\u2019 activities and consultations had been quite public, especially for those who had paid their registration fee to the district office, but also for most others, far from \nthe feeling of doing anything illegal. Especially in the case of drumming and \ndancing performed as a group in order to please certain spirits as part of heal-ing rituals, there is no evidence that it was ever felt to be illegal. \nIn addition to legalizing the existing tendencies towards even more spa-\ntial mobility within traditional medicine, the legal and administrative regula-tion of \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d also continues changes that had already been \ntaking place for some decades.  \nThe aspect of biomedicalization has been already dealt with. Profession-\nalization is the final topic to be discussed here. As Feierman (1986: 205\u20136, \n210\u201312) noted, the professionalization of \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d strengthens the importance of such healers, who mainly treat strangers for material gain as a business, while at the same time reducing the role of those \u201ccare-givers\u201d \nfor \u201caltruistic healing,\u201d who mostly treat relatives and neighbors free of \ncharge as a kind of religious service and who used to carry out the greatest part of health care. In southeast Tanzania, the composition of the members of the healers\u2019 association, CHAWATIATA  (Chama cha Waganga wa Tiba \nAsilia Tanzania), according to a list of 1053 names, does not at all reflect the \nactual care given (Nampyali, 16. 11. 2001).\n3 Thus, the wagariba, the experts \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n3  Interview with B. M. Nampyali, Secretary of CHAWATIATA (Chama cha \nWaganga wa Tiba Asilia Tanzania ). Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 47 \n \nin circumcision who themselves say that they do not heal and are not sought \nfor healing, form a considerable proportion of the members\u2019 list, whereas female spirit mediums, who are more than 80% of those who are called waganga wa jadi  or waganga wa kienyeji  by the people, are found in the list \nless often. \nUnregistered healers of this sort who have a rather spiritual focus will \nincreasingly be excluded from any informal network of healers, as \u00a7 36 (1) of the Act says that registered traditional health practitioners must not \u201callow, associate or otherwise cause a person who is not registered as such to practice as traditional or alternative health practitioner\u201d (apart from aides). Thereby, \nthe once common referral of patients to those experts who are regarded as \nbetter or even exclusively suited to a specific problem, such as possession of the patient by a certain spirit, is no longer allowed if these healers are not registered. At this point, the national public interest that the democratically \nelected government claims to represent is at odds with a religious practice approved by local publics in the interests of the individuals concerned. The \norderly professionalization of healing is not compatible with the motivation \nand practice of most spirit mediums who regard their call by a spirit, their initiation into rituals and secrets involving spirits, as well as their service to a community believing in these spirits, rather in religious terms. \nFinally, it can be asked how the recent Tanzanian Traditional and Alter-\nnative Medicines Act of 2002 should be qualified\u2014as accepting all aspects \nof healing, including the religious dimension, or as a further medicalization \nof it? Here the role of the market becomes central. As the Tanzanian Minister of Health, Anna Margareth Abdallah, mentioned in her 2002/2003 budget speech, the health sector reforms of the 1990s had among their goals \u201cpub-lic/private mix reforms such as encouragement of private sector to comple-ment public health services\u201d (Abdallah 2002). There was no hint in the offi-\ncial texts at that time that \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d should be one of these pri-\nvate services complementing the public sector, yet the new climate was cer-tainly favorable to the idea of greater freedoms for traditional healers. Some expected that legal acknowledgement would give such healers greater inde-pendence from biomedicine, which could provide opportunities to increase the visibility of the religious dimension in healing. The actual development, \nhowever, seems to point in another direction, namely towards even greater \nsimilarity with biomedical practitioners. There is the desire that in East Af-rica traditional healers should be given professional biomedical privileges 48 | Walter Bruchhausen  \nthat non-biomedical practitioners in other regions have already achieved, \nsuch as being financed by private health insurance and sometimes even by public sick funds, as in some European countries, or being able to certify the need for sick leave, as in South Africa. It would be the material rather than \nthe symbolic power that would be strengthened by such achievements.  \nThis new status of \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d as a modern private practice \nrather than a traditional public service certainly also changes the healer\u2019s re-\nlationship with his or her patients and the spirit world. Moreover, it has an impact on the less professionalized ways of and experts in traditional healing who still practice without substantial financial gain and within the commu-\nnity of a quasi-religious cult group. At this point, the approach that treats \n\u201ctraditional healers\u201d as a liberal profession might come into conflict with other, quite different arguments in favor of traditional healing. For, on the other side of the dialectics of \u201cglocalization,\u201d those who advocate traditional healing as part of an African revival\u2014as a constituent of a truly African iden-tity\u2014are usually not in favor of neoliberal globalization but emphasize rather \nthe local, social and cultural integration of healing, not its autonomy from public administration. For such \u201ctraditionalists,\u201d the new professional oppor-tunities for \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d may further loosen their last ties with a former understanding of healing that saw illness often caused by invisible personal forces and treatment as negotiation with these forces. \nBoth these approaches to enhancing the \u201ctraditional\u201d by giving it profes-\nsional autonomy, as well as through its social (re-)integration, returns us to the question of the social practices separating those functions that are cov-ered by the two functional systems of medicine and religion in more func-tionally differentiated societies. How should healing be approached le-gally\u2014by applying the criterion of scientific and professional knowledge, or by referring to pure consumer choice? In fact, the public regulation and em-\npowerment of traditional health practitioners according to the new Tanzanian \nAct does not go much beyond the colonial legislation, which already left the decisive role to local publics. This kind of social control leaves a space for versions of religious healing within \u201ctraditional medicine.\u201d Hospitals built by successful traditional healers for their clients,\n4 where communal prayers, \nrituals with the healer or meditation in a holy place occupy the day for the \ntemporary residents, rather resemble or even constitute the sorts of \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n4  An example fo r such a hospital is that  in Mwera, southeast Tanzania. Medicalized Healing in East Africa | 49 \n \ncongregations or monasteries that are known from old or new religions in \nseveral parts of the world. The spirit mediums can combine their roles as cult leaders and healers without much interference from the political administra-tion. But, as a pure herbalist without any reference to a religious world view \nfalls under the same Act as the keeper of a holy place or a spirit medium of \nthe sort just mentioned, they are all officially labeled  \u201cmedical.\u201d While ear-\nlier colonial and national legislation merely exempted them all from medical registration, the new legislation requires that they all be registered with the medical office.  \n \n \n5  CONCLUSION  \n \nPractices li ke the incantation of spirits, sacrifices to them or explaining ill-\nness with reference to their activities\u2014practices that would be classified by \nmost observers of today as \u201creligious\u201d in other contexts\u2014constitute the prob-\nably most important part of what is consulted as \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d in present-day Tanzania, but not of what, under this term, is regulated by na-tional or international health authorities and investigated by scientific re-search. This equivocal use of the term led to the question of how this present relationship between the functions of medicine and religion was shaped by \nthe various influences of encounters with people and powers from outside \nAfrica. Nearly all these influences favored a separation of healing practices from their religious contexts and understanding. Doctors and scientists were mainly interested in bioactive substances, colonial and post-independence administrators were concerned to suppress possible social unrest arising from ritual practices, and Islamic and Christian experts tried to free healing from \nallegedly \u201cpagan\u201d ideas.  \nIn this study, two common notions about the foreign treatment of \u201ctradi-\ntional medicine\u201d have been questioned and disproved by means of further \ndifferentiation of what is meant by \u201ctraditional medicine\u201d: its alleged colo-nial suppression, and its supposed acknowledgment in the Declaration of Alma Ata on Primary Health Care of WHO and UNICEF. By distinguishing \nthe social, mental, and religious functions from the physically effective \nmeans and practices, the commonalities between the attitudes of colonial ad-ministrations, Christian missions, the WHO, and independent governments are shown to be more marked than the differences: none of them 50 | Walter Bruchhausen  \nwholeheartedly embraced the ritual and symbolic side of \u201ctraditional medi-\ncine\u201d, but at best tolerated it, whereas they all expressed a much greater in-terest in the bioactive substances of herbal remedies. \nIt was the less orthodox versions of cosmopolitan religion, the Sufi or \ntariqat  traditions of Islam and Pentecostal, Zionist, or charismatic Christian-\nity, that opened up spaces for the adaptive survival of healing practices re-lated to spirits and the countering of evil forces. Other healing experts orga-nized their adapted rituals without obvious ties to a monotheistic religion. In either way, local wishes to keep the experience of ill health related to the experience of an invisible world of helpful and hostile beings find their sat-\nisfaction in new groups that have replaced the former ritual community of \nclans or settlements. Religious connotations of healing are now also present in many of the more commercialized and individualized encounters between healers and clients. But the very facts that all these experts are now registered with the district medical offices in accordance with national legislation on \u201ctraditional and alternative medicine,\u201d are being investigated by scientific \nresearchers interested in herbal medicine and are being contacted by biomed-\nical institutions for cooperation on certain health issues indicate and strengthen their overriding inclination towards medicine. \n  \nBIBLIOGRAPHY  \n Abdallah, Anna M.

There-fore, the question arises how contemporary religious actors offering therapeutic prac-tices can legitimize their actions and position themselves in Japanese society. By \nchoosing the example of a Nichiren -Buddhist pri est\u2019s concepts of Buddhist medicine \nand Buddhism as medicine, as well as healing practices in a new religion called Per-\nfect Liberty Ky \u014ddan, two strategies of legitimizing and positioning therapeutic prac-\ntices in the religious field will be described: the s cientification of religious practice, \nand code -switching between the semantic fields of medicine and religion.  \n \n \n1  INTRODUCTION  \n \nThis article explores possible ways in which contemporary religious actors \nwhose religious traditions used to comprise medical or therapeutical tech-\nniques, react to a social and political environment in which religions are\u2014at 58 | Monika Schrimpf  \nleast on a political level\u2014deprived of medical authority. How can they legit-\nimize engaging in therapeutical activities intended to cure or prevent disease, and how do they position themselves in a society where religion and medi-cine are functionally and institutionally differentiated? More specifically, the \nstrategies introduced here illustrate religious responses to the relevance as-\nsigned to science in the process of medicalization,\n1 i.e., to the replacement of \nreligious views of man, body and illness by scientific models of physiologi-cal processes and conceptualizations of the human body as a multipartite or-ganism. These strategies are not representative of Japanese religions in gen-eral; rather, they serve to illustrate possible ways in which religious actors \nmake use of the alleged superiority of science-based medicine in order to \nlegitimize their therapeutical activities and consolidate the social status of their religious community.  \nAlthough in premodern Japan, medical knowledge and practice were an \nindispensable part of Japanese Buddhism, public healthcare in contemporary Japan is provided primarily by biomedical institutions and experts whose sci-\nentific training and licensing is regulated by secular law. This medical system \nrests not only on the development of biomedical knowledge, practices, and institutions since the introduction of German medicine in the Meiji era (1868\u20131912), it also includes kanp\u014d  medicine or \u201cJapanese traditional herbal \nmedicine\u201d, the Japanese adaptation of Chinese medical traditions.\n2 Whereas \nin the late Edo (1603\u20131868) and early Meiji eras kanp\u014d medicine was the \nmain rival of so-called Western medicine ( seiy\u014d ijutsu) (Oberl\u00e4nder 1995: \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1  For the concept of \u201cmedicalization\u201d cp., for example, Conrad 2007; Foucault \n1973. Conrad provides a short definition of the term: \u201c Mecicalization\u2019 describes \na process by which nonmedical problems become defined and treated as medical \nproblems, usually in terms of illness and disorders.\u201d (2007: 4).  \n2  Literally, kanp \u014d means \u201cmethods from Han -China\u201d (206 BC\u2013 220 AD). Chinese \nmedicine was introduced to Japan in the fifth century in the wake of the spre ad of \nBuddhism to the country. Kanp \u014d medicine developed its specifically Japanese \nform during the Edo period (1603 \u20131868), when the number of crude drugs used \nin decoctions was reduced to approximately 250 herbal plants and formulae, and Yoshimasu T \u014dd\u014d (170 2\u20131773) developed a particular abdominal palpation \nmethod ( fukushin ) for diagnosis. He also emphasized the practical, symptom -ori-\nented focus of medical practice and de -emphasized the underlying theoretical \nconcepts of the five phases, Yin and Yang etc . (Watanabe  et al. 2010).  \u2018Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 59 \n51), today it has been smoothly integrated into the medical system as a com-\nplementary herbal drug treatment.3  \nNotwithstanding the dominance of biomedicine and its incorporation of \nkanp\u014d, other types of medical techniques, such as acupuncture and moxibus-\ntion ( shinky \u016b) and massage therapy ( anma), are also acknowledged as part of \nthe public healthcare system and are subject to a training and licensing sys-\ntem regulated by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW).4  \nOutside the realm of officially recognized medical practices, religious \nactors, especially in the field of \u201cnew religions\u201d ( shinsh\u016bky \u014d) and the \u201cnew \nspirituality culture\u201d ( shin reisei  bunka),5 but also in folk religion or the so-\ncalled established religions ( kisei sh\u016bky\u014d), provide alternative explanations \nfor what causes illnesses and offer corresponding practices designed to heal6 \nthem. These forms of religious therapeutic knowledge and practice must be analyzed against the backdrop of a functionally differentiated society. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n3  Therefore, a critical juxtaposition of these two as representing (reductionist) \nWestern vs. (holistic) \u201ctraditional\u201d or indigenous medicine, as suggested by Mar-garet Lock under the labels \u201ccosmopolitan medical system\u201d and \u201c East Asi an med-\nical system\u201d ( 1980: 3), is questionable for present -day Japan. Still, her study pro-\nvides valuable insights into medical views and attitudes of contemporary kanp \u014d \ndoctors and patients.  \n4  For information on the licensing system for acupuncturists, moxibustionists and anma massage therapists, see the website of the Japanese Society for Acupuncture \nand Moxibustion (JSAM): http://en.jsam.jp/contents.php/020000RNSXjD/ , July \n4, 2018. Acupuncture, moxibustion, and anma massage or acupressure therapy \nare partly covered by national health insurance (http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs  \n/en/d/Jh2943e/9.6.html#Jh2943e.9.6 , July 4, 2018).  \n5  The term as coined by Shimazono Susumu designates the New Age culture of Japan as comprising imported elements of Western New Age, as well as specifi-\ncally Japanese notions of spirituality and related activities, networks, i.e., the so-called \u201cspiritual world\u201d ( seishin sekai ) (2007: 46 \u201357). \n6  The term \u201chealing\u201d ( iyashi as noun, iyasu  as verb) as applied in the context of \nreligions and the new s pirituality culture goes beyond the meaning of physical \ncuring. As Yumiyama Tatsuya states with regard to contemporary Japanese new religions: \u201cThus religious people speak not only of diseases that are cured through faith but of diseases that, uncured, occ asion the realization of the true meaning of \nlife or the perception of erroneous ways of thought.\u201d (Yumiyama 1995: 269).  60 | Monika Schrimpf  \nDespite the historical relevance of therapeutic services in the Buddhist or \nnew religious traditions, propagating them today requires legitimizing the religious claims of an authority that is assigned to medical institutions, knowledge and social practices.  \n  \n2  TERMINOLOGICAL REFLE CTIONS  \n \nThe term biomedicine is applied here to denote a conceptualization of medi-\ncine based on the principles of the natural sciences, in particular biology. \nNotwithstanding multi-layered criticisms of the term as both a research per-spective and a medical concept (Bruchhausen 2010), I prefer \u201cbiomedicine\u201d to the alternative terms \u201cWestern medicine\u201d and \u201cmodern medicine,\u201d which are often used in literature about Japanese medical history. Not only does \u201cWestern medicine\u201d disguise the plurality of medical traditions in Europe \nand North America, it also ignores the developments that took place in Jap-\nanese biomedicine after its introduction in the Meiji era. Besides, both \u201cWestern medicine\u201d and \u201cmodern medicine\u201d are used as counter- terms in  the \nrealm of traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine, where they denote a symptom-oriented, science-based kind of medicine originating in the \u201cWest\u201d that does not take the mental and spiritual aspects of illness into \naccount. For example, on the website of the Japanese Society for Integrative \nMedicine, the basic distinction between symptomatic treatment ( taish\u014d  \nry\u014dh\u014d) and causal treatment ( gen\u2019in ry \u014dh\u014d) is used to characterize the differ-\nences between modern Western medicine ( kindai seiy \u014d igaku ) and tradi-\ntional, complementary, and alternative medicine ( dent \u014d igaku, s \u014dho daitai \niry\u014d). \u201cThe kind of medicine practised in many medical institutions today \nbuilds on modern Western medicine with its focus on the treatment of symp-toms\u201d (http://imj.or.jp/intro, July 4, 2018).\n7  \nIn contrast, the concepts of oriental medicine ( t\u014dy\u014d iry \u014d)8, East Asian \nmedicine (Lock 1980), and traditional medicine ( dent \u014d igaku) are often \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n7  This and all following English quotations from Japanese sources are my own \ntranslations.  \n8  See, for example, the website of the  Japan Society for Oriental Medicine, which \nis dedicated exclusively to kanp \u014d medicine ( http://www.jsom.or.jp/index.html , \nJanuary 29, 2018 ). Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 61 \nqualified as representing a holistic, individualistic, and natural approach to \nhealth and wellbeing. The Japan Holistic Medical Society explains the main principles of holistic medicine ( horisutikku igaku) as a \u201cholistic (wholesome) \nview of health\u201d ( horisutikku (zenteki) kenk \u014dkan), reliance on \u201cthe therapeutic \npowers of nature as the source of healing,\u201d trust in self-healing powers, the combining of various medical methods to create the appropriate treatment for each case, and the conviction that realizing the inherent meaning of ill-ness contributes to individual self-realization (http://www.holistic-medicine.or.jp/holistic/definition/, July 4, 2018). Traditional medicine is de-scribed by the Japanese Society for Integrative Medicine in terms of juxta-\nposing culture with science:  \n \n\u201cThere are specific styles based on regional characteristics such as climate, food, eth-\nnos, customs etc., and they have evolved as traditional medicine and folk medicine. \nIn this sense, traditional medicine is c learly more of a culture than a science, and given \nthis background it can be viewed as a medicine tailored to the patients\u2019 and clients\u2019 \nindividuality.\u201d ( http://imj.or.jp/intro/qa , January 29, 2017)  \n \nHowever, both societies advocate the combined use of biomedicine, Japa-\nnese traditional medicine, and CAM (Complementary and Alternative Med-icine). This discourse also provides an important frame for proponents of Buddhist medicine.\n\u0001\n  62 | Monika Schrimpf  \n3  DIFFERENTIATION OF R ELIGION AND MEDICINE \nIN JAPAN  \n \nFrom ancient times, health care in Japan was provided by either officially trained physicians or Buddhist \u201cpriest-doctors\u201d ( s\u014di).\n9 In ancient Japan, Chi-\nnese medical literature and the knowledge transmitted by Korean physicians provided the main basis for medical practice. From the ninth century, these writings were complemented by Japanese medical literature, starting with the \nDaid\u014d ruijuh \u014d (806\u2013810) and the Ishinp\u014d (982\u2013984) (Rosner 1989: 12\u201333). \nIn addition, Buddhist priests relied upon Chinese (and to a lesser degree In-\ndian) medical knowledge as passed on in Buddhist scriptures such as the Su-\ntra of Golden Light  (Jp. Konk \u014dmy\u014dky\u014d; Skt. Suvar \u0146aprabh\u0101 sottama-s \u016btra), \nthe meditation manuals Tendai sh\u014d shikan (\u201cShorter Treatise on \u015bamatha and \nvipa\u015byan\u0101\u201d) and Maka shikan  (\u201cThe Great Calming and Insight\u201d) by the Chi-\nnese monk Zhiyi (Chigi; 538\u2013597), founder of Tian\u2019tai Buddhism and many more.\n10 From the Heian era (794\u20131185), Buddhist temples became places \nwhere commoners could find medical help. Paul Demi\u00e9vielle\u2019s classification of three types of Buddhist healing practices corresponds to Buddhist medi-cine as practiced throughout Japanese history: Buddhist healing comprised \u201creligious therapeutics (good works, and practices of worship, expiation; \nmeditation etc.), magical therapeutics (mantras, incantations, esoteric ritual), \nand medical therapeutics proper (dietetics, pharmacy, surgery etc.). The lines demarcating these fields are not at all distinct\u201d (D\u00e9mieville 1985: 6).\n11 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n9  For general overviews of Japanese medical history, cp . Fujikawa 1911, Kuriyama \nand Yamada 1997, Rosner 1989, and the historical chapters in Siary and Ben-\nhamou 1994.  \n10  Beside Paul D\u00e9mieville\u2019s fundamental article on Buddhism and healing (1985 in English, original 1937), Pierce Salguero has written extensively on the transmis-sion of Indian and Chinese medicine in Chinese Buddhist scriptur es (2013, 2012, \n2010\u2013 11, 2009). See also Katja Triplett\u2019s introduction to Buddhist medical scrip-\ntures used in early and medieval Japanese Buddhism (2012).  \n11  Various authors have contributed to the study of Buddhist medical history in Ja-pan: For early and medieval Japan see Cristoph Kleine (2012), Juhn Ahn (2008), \nEdward Drott (2010), Katja Triplett (2012), and Andrew Goble (2011). Pamela Winfield (2005) and Jason Ananda Josephson (2013) focus on the medieval and early modern Buddhist practice of \u201cempoweri ng prayers\u201d ( kaji) and their re -Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 63 \nFrom the late sixteenth century, Buddhist priest-doctors were challenged \nand complemented by medical professionals trained in kanp\u014d medicine and \nfrequently also in the Confucian and neo-Confucian classics (Josephson \n2013: 125; Rosner 1989: 63\u201372). Starting with the arrival of European mis-\nsionaries in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, both traditions were con-\nfronted with the gradual spread of European medical thought. With the pub-lication in 1774 of Sugita Genpaku\u2019s (1733\u20131817) Kaitai Shinsho (\u201cA New \nBook on Anatomy\u201d), a Japanese translation of the Dutch translation of Jo-hann Adam Kulmus\u2019 Anatomische Tabellen (1725),\n12 European anatomical \nknowledge became increasingly known in Japan. In the Meiji era, concepts \nof the human body as a kind of independent organism gradually started to \nsupersede hitherto prevalent views of the body as being influenced by the flow of ki, the relevance of its balance,  and its effects on the internal organs.  \nIn the wake of modernization, the new Meiji government installed a sys-\ntem of public healthcare that shifted responsibility for health from the indi-vidual to the state. Starting in 1874, a standardized system of medical exam-\nination was established, and from 1876 anyone aspiring to acquire a license \nas a physician had to study biomedicine as imported from Germany. The first \ndecree issued in 1874 by the Ministry of Education regulated the training and licensing examination of physicians and pharmacists, as well as the control of pharmaceuticals (Oberl\u00e4nder 1995: 61).\n It was followed by various regu-\nlations ( kisoku) and codified as a law ( fukoku) in 1883 (Oberl\u00e4nder 1995: 61\u2013\n62,140). Medical ideologists like the physician and politician G \u014dt\u014d Shinpei \n(1857\u20131929) denounced premodern medical practices, such as kanp\u014d or Bud-\ndhist healing prayers, as useless, obstructing modern medicine, and damag-ing the national body. In addition, in 1874 the Ministry of Doctrine (Ky\u014dbush\u014d) issued an ordinance specifically prohibiting religious healing practices: \u201cHealing by means of magical rituals and the like are obstructing \nthe government and are henceforth prohibited.\u201d (Josephson 2013:129\u2013131, \nquote 131; Shinmura 2013: 283)  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \ninterpretation in the modern era. For the early modern period see Duncan Ry \u016bken \nWilliams\u2019 study on the medical activities of S \u014dt\u014d temples in Tokugawa Japan \n(2005: 83 \u2013116), and Juhn Ahn on the relation between Zen, medicine and sword \nfighting  (2012). See also Nihonyanagi\u2019s study on medicine in esoteric Buddhism \n(1997) and Shinmura\u2019s (2013) overview of Buddhist medical history in Japan.  \n12  The Ontleedkundige Tafelen  or \u201cAnatomical Tables\u201d, 1734.  64 | Monika Schrimpf  \nThe gradual implementation of this policy13 was a blow especially to \nkanp\u014d  doctors, who in 1873 made up about eighty percent of Japanese phy-\nsicians, and to Buddhist temples offering medical services. A Westernization \nof medicine took place , in which medicine was differentiated from religion \nas a separate sphere, regulated by the state authorities, and conceptualized as pursuing different goals. \nAs a result of these processes, biomedical institutions and practices have \nbecome the dominant form of medicine in contemporary Japan. Yet ever since the revival of kanp \u014d medicine in postwar Japan, starting with the foun-\ndation of the Japan Society for Oriental Medicine ( Nihon t \u014dy\u014d igakkai ) in \n1950, kanp \u014d has become an integral part of the contemporary healthcare sys-\ntem.\n14 It should be noted, however, that this integrated form of kanp\u014d differs \nsubstantially from premodern kanp \u014d: most conventional physicians do not \npractice the kanp\u014d-specific type of diagnosis ( sh\u014d)15 but prescribe herbal \ndrugs on the basis of conventional medical diagnoses. Moreover, most kanp\u014d  \ndrugs are produced using industrialized techniques in which spray-dried \ngranulate extracts have replaced the former decoction of crude drugs \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n13  Takeda D \u014dsh\u014d points out that the implementatio n of the health policy of licensing \nphysicians and hospitals was slow and that the lower social classes had limited \naccess to them. For him, the coincidence of this failure of public healthcare with numerous cholera epidemics in the 1880s and 1890s support ed the popularity of \nreligious healing practices offered by new religions such as Renmonky \u014d (Takeda \nD\u014dsh\u014d 1991; http://www2.kokugakuin.ac.jp/ijcc/wp/cpjr/newreligions/takeda . \n html, January 29, 2018 ). \n14  For a detailed reconstruction of the kanp \u014d revival movement in the twentieth cen-\ntury, cp. Oberl\u00e4nder 1995 and Hattori 2014. See also Margaret Lock\u2019s fieldwork study (1980) of the activities and conceptualizations of kanp \u014d doctors and patients \nin the 1980s. Since 2001, kanp \u014d has been included in the curriculum of obligatory \nmedical studies, and conventional physicians are allowed to prescribe kanp \u014d \ndrugs, 148 of which are covered by national health insurance (Watanabe et al. \n2011).  \n15  The typical kanp \u014d diagnosis comprises  \u201c[\u2026] investigation of the complaints and \nsymptoms of the patient, including taking their temperature, examining sensation, \nweakness or sweating [\u2026]. The physical examination includes abdominal palpa-tion, tongue insp ection and pulse diagnosis.\u201d (Watanabe et al. 2011, 1.3 \u201cBack-\nground of Kampo\u201d) . Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 65 \n(Watanabe et al. 2011, 1.2, \u201cUsage and Integration into Modern Medicine\u201d). \nNotwithstanding these changes, kanp \u014d is extremely popular in contemporary \nJapan.16 \n \n\u201cWhile Chinese medicine and acupuncture are looked on with doubt by some and \nthere is certainly room for debate as to whether or not these therapies are seen by most as viable means of treating serious illness, as an overal l trend, current attitudes to-\nwards kanp \u014d and acupuncture are perhaps more positive than any time since the Meiji \nperiod.\u201d (Hattori 2014: 18)  \n \nAlthough kanp\u014d  is based on premodern medical practices which were a full-\nfledged alternative to biomedicine, today kanp\u014d physicians and the Japan So-\nciety for Oriental Medicine tend to characterize it as a complementary form \nof medicine which compensates for the limits and deficiencies of biomedi-cine. In doing so, they have adopted the critical stance and semantics of Com-plementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), emphasizing the holistic ap-\nproach and the naturalness of kanp\u014d  medicine, its reliance on the patient\u2019s \nown self-healing powers, and its effectiveness in cases of chronic diseases \n(where biomedicine fails) (Oberl\u00e4nder 1995: 217\u2013219). Oberl\u00e4nder explains this re-interpretation as resulting from the new educational system estab-lished since the Meiji era, which requires all kanp\u014d specialists to be trained \ndoctors of conventional medicine (1995: 219).\n17 Thus, contemporary kanp \u014d \nis an \u201cinvented tradition\u201d (cp.

Hattori diligently reconstructs how the mutual \nvisit of a German physician (Heribert Schmidt) studying kanp \u014d and acupuncture \nin Japan, and the subsequent visit of a Japanese kanp \u014d doctor (Hiroshi Sakaguchi) \nto Germany in the 1950s influenced the kanp \u014d and acupuncturist movements and \nthe self -perceptions of their supporters in Japan (cp. 2014).  66 | Monika Schrimpf  \nsekai ).18 Whereas healing services provided in networks or so-called \u201cclient \nreligions\u201d are open to everybody, rituals specific to the new religions are \nusually accessible only to their members. In addition, recent initiatives prop-agate Buddhist places and practices as contributing to individual wellbeing, \nsuch as temple yoga or meditation as a means of stress-reduction (e.g. \nhttp://www.tera-buddha.net/project/spilit_body/, January 29, 2018).  \n  \n4  TWO CASE STUDIES  \n \nThe following two case studies are situated in the contexts of (1) traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine in a Buddhist setting, and (2) reli-gious healing practices in new religions. The examples of the Nichiren Bud-dhist priest Kageyama Ky\u014d shun and the new religion Perfect Liberty Ky\u014d dan \nprovide insights into two possible legitimation strategies used by contempo-\nrary religious actors offering therapeutic practices. They were chosen be-\ncause they illustrate significant ways of relating religious and medical or sci-entific authority and not because they represent the main advocates of thera-peutic practices in established Buddhism, TCAM or new religions in Japan. In accordance with Steve Bruce\u2019s observation that nowadays \u201conly the fringes of religion\u201d (2016: 640) propagate (or reject) therapeutic practices, \nboth examples illustrate these fringes: Perfect Liberty Ky\u014ddan as a new reli-\ngion and Kageyama Ky\u014dshun as a non-mainstream Buddhist priest, as we shall see below. \n \n4.1  Buddhist M edicine: Kageyama Ky\u014dshun  \n \nDespite the long history of Buddhist medical practice in Japan, contemporary advocates of Buddhism as a medical tradition are comparatively rare. In-stead, Buddhist schools and individuals have recently become actively en-gaged in providing spiritual care or grief care,\n19 especially for terminally ill \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n18  Cp., for example, Araya et al. 1995; Kubotera 2011; Tanabe/Shimazono 2002; \nShimazono 2003 .  \n19  Cp., e.g., the Vihara Movement and concepts of Buddhist counseling as devel-\noped in J \u014ddo Shinsh\u016b (Tomohis a 2010, 2013), or the cross -denominational Insti-\ntute for Engaged Budd hism (Rissh \u014d Bukky \u014d Kenky \u016bsho; http://www.zenseikyo.

The research adopted a critical stance towards bio-\nmedicine because of its alleged tendencies towards objectification, dehuman-ization, and superficial doctor-patient relations. In contrast, Buddhist medi-cine was advocated as a means to add a holistic and humanistic perspective to contemporary healthcare (Muraoka 2003: 4\u20135). In defining Buddhist med-\nicine, Muraoka Kiyoshi, head of the research group, referred to a contempo-\nrary interpretation of the sixth century meditation manual Maka shikan, men-\ntioned above, thus contributing to the construction of an \u201cinvented tradition\u201d of Buddhist medicine.\n21 \nThe same critical attitude towards biomedicine and the characterization \nof Buddhist medicine in accordance with the rhetoric of CAM is expressed \nin a recent publication on \u201cMedicine and Buddhism\u201d ( iry\u014d to bukky \u014d) in the \nBuddhist journal Samgha Japan (2018). Here, the depiction of Western med-\nicine ( seiy\u014d igaku) in opposition to Eastern medicine ( t\u014dy\u014d igaku), namely \nkanp\u014d, acupuncture, moxibustion, and other ki-based healing techniques, is \nintertwined with a fundamental cultural critique of \u201cthe values of Europe and \nAmerica\u201d ( \u014dbei no kachikan) as manifested in materialistic thought and an \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \nor.jp/rinbutsuken/index.html , January 29, 2018 ).

Kageyama is a graduate of Nichiren-Buddhist Rissh\u014d University (Buddhist Studies) and obtained his \nPh.D. in Behavioral Sciences from the California Institute for Human Sci-\nence (CIHS)\n22 with a thesis about the psychological and physiological as-\npects of the Chinese Tendai monk Zhiyi\u2019s (538\u2013597) meditation manual Ten-\ndai sh\u014d shikan.

The fol-\nlowing analysis is based on three of his publications: Buddhist Body Tech-\nniques: Relating \u201cCalming the Mind and Insight\u201d [Meditation] to Psycho-therapy and Buddhist Medicine  (2007), Healing Illness by Prayer  (2010), \nand A Buddhist Life awakening to Spirituality: Contemporary Buddhism as \nMeditation Techniques  (2013).\n23 Whereas Healing Illness by Prayer  is writ-\nten in a rather simple style to advocate the healing effects of Buddhist \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n22  This institute in Encinitas, California, has been founded by Motoyama Hiroshi \n(1925 \u20132015), parapsychologist and second head of the religious group Tama-\nmitsu Jinja.

Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 69 \npractices, the other two books combine elaborate depictions of Indian and \nChinese medical concepts transmitted in Buddhist writings with physiologi-cal explanations of the effects of Buddhist meditation techniques. In both his temple activities and his publications, Kageyama propagates Buddhism as a \nsalutogenetic medical tradition and a Buddhist way of living as a guarantor \nof a healthy life. He argues (1) that Buddhist practice is simultaneously the r-\napeutical practice, and (2) that \u201ctraditional\u201d Buddhist medicine\n24 represents \nthe premodern \u201cmedicine of nourishing life\u201d ( y\u014dj\u014d iry \u014d)25 as a countermodel \nto modern \u201cWestern medicine\u201d ( seiy\u014d igaku). For both arguments, he relies \nprimarily on Zhiyi\u2019s meditation manuals, whether with regard to their expla-\nnations of the causes, types, and treatments of diseases, or as the ultimate \nauthority for East Asian meditation techniques. For reasons of space, I will focus here on his second argument.  \nKageyama defines Buddhism as meditation techniques ( meis \u014d gijutsu) \nthat enable us \u201cto live in a healthy way and face death in a healthy way\u201d (2013: 300). In his understanding, meditation includes various forms of reli-\ngious practice ( shugy \u014d), such as sitting meditation ( zazen ), walking medita-\ntion, sutra recitation, invocations of the Lotus Sutra\u2019s title ( daimoku) or \nAmida Buddha\u2019s name ( nenbutsu),  or service to others (Kageyama 2010: \n105; 2013: 28). He advocates Buddhist meditation as the appropriate way of \novercoming the separation of mind and body as prevalent in modern, com-\npetitive societies: \u201cAs mentioned before, the main need of societies in which \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n24  Buddhist medicine for Kageyama denotes the transmission of Ayurvedic and Chi-\nnese medicine in Buddhist scriptures and its reception by Japanese Buddhists such \nas Nichir en (1222\u2013 1282).  \n25  Y\u014dj\u014d (Chin. yangsheng ) denotes \u201ca broad array of practices aimed at nourishing \nand prolonging life, including breathing exercises, dietetics (especially abstention \nfrom grains), sexual practices, meditation and visualization exercises, pharmaceu-tical presc riptions, and methods of \u2018guiding and pulling\u2019 ( \u5c0e\u5f15) vital pneuma or \nqi \u6c23 (Jp. ki)\u201d (Drott 2010: 254). Originating in China, yangsheng  theories and \npractices spread in Japan through Chinese medical writings. They were adopted and complemented by Buddhist an d other authors, such as My\u014dan Eisai (1141 \u2013\n1215), Kaibara Ekken  (1630 \u20131714), and many more. See Drott\u2019s (2010) analysis \nof Kissay \u014dj\u014dki (1211) and Ch\u014dseiry \u014dy\u014dh\u014d (1184), and Ahn\u2019s (2008) study of Kai-\nbara Ekken\u2019s Y\u014dj\u014dkun. For Kageyama, y\u014dj\u014d medicine was transmitted by Bud-\ndhism, and its core is the medical chapter in Zhiyi\u2019s Maka shikan  (2013: 169).  70 | Monika Schrimpf  \nmind and body are separated is liberation from stress, and this can be realized \nby means of meditation techniques which unite mind and body\u201d (2013: 4). Accordingly, Kageyama calls his temple a Buddhist Meditation Center ( Buk-\nky\u014d meis \u014d sent \u0101) and offers not only the usual ritual services, but also yoga \nclasses, meditation and consultation sessions. In addition, his wife provides Ayurvedic treatment and macrobiotic meals.\n26  \nBy means of these services and this self-representation, Kageyama\u2019s tem-\nple differs from most other Nichiren Buddhist temples. Given his strong crit-icisms of temple priests who restrict their activities to funerary rites rather than thinking of ways in which they can be helpful to contemporary Japa-\nnese,\n27 one can easily imagine that he is a contested figure in contemporary \ntemple Buddhism. Therefore, Kageyama could be said to exemplify religious \nadvocates of medicine at the margins of mainstream religion. \n \n4.2  Healing in New R eligions: Perfect Liberty (PL) Ky \u014ddan \n \nStarting with the earliest new religions, such as Tenriky\u014d, \u014cmoto, Konk\u014dky \u014d \netc., healing has been an important element in the practices of Japanese new religions. Nagai Mikiko distinguishes between forms of \u201cmagical healing\u201d (jujutsuteki na iyashi ), which are based on the performance of rituals or rely \non supernatural powers, and \u201chealing by self-cultivation\u201d ( sh\u016by \u014dteki na \niyashi ) (Nagai 1995: 97\u201398). Robert Kisala adds the category of \u201csocial heal-\ning\u201d ( shakaiteki iyashi ), which refers to social engagement, i.e., \u201c[\u2026] to put \nit in strong terms, what we can see is the intention to heal the maladies of society as a whole\u201d (Kisala 1995: 112). Like Yumiyama, Nagai emphasizes that healing in this context refers to individual perceptions of being saved, irrespective of whether physical curing has taken place or not (Nagai 1995: \n97).  \nHealing practices in the new religion Perfect Liberty Ky\u014ddan are an ex-\nample of how magical healing and healing by self-cultivation overlap. Its followers are encouraged to engage in guided moral self-cultivation as a means to overcome disease, injuries, and other forms of misfortune. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n26  http://temple.nichiren.or.jp/1031159 -syakazi/ ; http://sunwork.her.jp/ayurveda/in-\ndex.html , July 4, 2018.  \n27  Private conversation, September 2016.  Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 71 \nGuidance, however, relies on god\u2019s saving powers as transmitted by the head \nof the group or its religious teachers ( ky\u014dshi).  \nPerfect Liberty Ky\u014d dan (cp. Schrimpf 2018) has existed in its present \nform since 1946, but it goes back to the pre-war community of Hitonomichi \nKy\u014ddan (founded by Miki Tokuharu (1871\u20131938) in 1925) and its predeces-\nsor Mikateky\u014d Tokumitsu Daiky \u014dkai (founded in 1912, renamed in Shint \u014d \nTokumintsu Daiky\u014dkai in 1917). Already the pre-war religious movements had a strong focus on self-cultivation and healing, centering on the practice ofurikae as the temporary transference of illness to the head of the group (Serikawa 1972: 1\u201327). Although in Hitonomichi Ky\u014d dan veneration of the \nemperor was strongly emphasized, in 1937 Miki Tokuharu and his son To-kuchika (1900\u20131983) were accused of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 and the group was or-dered to dissolve (Serikawa 1972: 280\u2013281; Kojima 2008). It was refounded as Perfect Liberty Ky \u014ddan in 1946 by Miki Tokuchika. \nPL Ky\u014ddan has approximately 1.2 million members and is headed by \nMiki Takahito, the third \u201cparent of the teaching\u201d ( oshieoya), whose uncle \nwas Miki Tokuchika (http://www.perfect-liberty.or.jp/html/name-pl/kyouso .html, January 29, 2018).  The doctrinal core consists of 21 \u201crules of living\u201d \n(shoseikun) as guidelines for the moral conduct of life. As summarized in the \nslogan \u201cLife is Art\u201d ( jinsei wa geijutsu de aru), salvation is conceptualized \nas perfecting moral self-cultivation. With its concepts of divine notices (mishirase ) and divine instructions ( mioshie ) as essential tools of salvation, \nPL Ky\u014ddan offers a religious interpretation of illness, and its religious teach-ers direct the believers in overcoming it. Illness, injuries, and misfortune are seen as divine notices ( mishirase ) indicating distortions of one\u2019s self-expres-\nsion as manifest in inappropriate habitual behaviour or bad habits ( koko-\nroguse ) such as greed, obstinacy, arrogance, hurry etc. In order to reveal \nthese distortions, so-called divine instructions ( mioshie ) are granted by god \nto the head of the group, the oshieoya, as someone who is in a \u201cpurely objec-tive state\u201d ( junsui kyakkan no ky \u014dchi) and \u201cone with heaven\u201d ( tenjin g\u014ditsu) \n(Miki 1979: 118).  \nThese two examples differ in type of actor\u2014Kageyama as an individual \nactor, PL religious teachers as collective actors\u2014and data. In the case of Kageyama, analysis relies mainly on his publications. In the case of PL \nKy\u014ddan, the main data are the group\u2019s publications and instructions directed \nat the religious teachers (P \u0101fekuto Ribat \u012b Ky\u014ddan Bunky\u014d ka 1991). In the \nfollowing, the focus will be on the level of semantics, that is, on the ways in 72 | Monika Schrimpf  \nwhich elements of the semantic field of medicine are blended into the seman-\ntic field of religion.  \n  \n5  RELIGION AND MEDICINE AS STRATEGI C \nACTION FIELDS28  \n \nStrategic action fields are social orders that provide a conceptual and practi-\ncal frame for the interaction of individual or collective actors. This term, \ncoined by Neil Fligstein and Douglas McAdam, designates \u201ca constructed mesolevel social order in which actors (who can be individual or collective) are attuned to and interact with one another on the basis of shared (which is not to say consensual) understandings about the purposes of the field, rela-tionships to others in the field (including who has power and why), and the \nrules governing legitimate action in the field\u201d (Fligstein/McAdam 2012: 9). \nThe \u201cshared\u201d but not necessarily consensual understandings refer to (1) \u201cwhat is going on in the field, i.e. what\u2019s at stake\u201d; (2) the existence of a set of actors possessing more or less power; (3) the nature of the rules governing possible, legitimate and interpretable actions; and (4) interpretive frames ap-plied to the actions of others\u201d (Fligstein/McAdam 2012: 10\u201311).  \nIn our cases, both types of actors clearly position themselves within a \nsubfield of religion, either Japanese Buddhism or PL Ky \u014ddan. Both act ac-\ncording to their perceptions of the rules governing legitimate action in their respective fields. Neither Kageyama\u2019s nor PL Ky\u014d dan\u2019s religious teachers \nperform medical practices in a technical sense. Kageyama propagates reli-gious practices such as meditation techniques, prayers, recitation of the Lotus \nSutra or invocation of its title ( namu my \u014dh\u014d rengeky \u014d), as well as moral prac-\ntice and body practices, such as breathing exercises, physical exercises, die-\ntetics, hygienic routines etc. (Kageyama 2010: 156\u2013173). PL religious teach-ers guide their believers toward a moral conduct to which they ascribe heal-ing effects. In PL Ky\u014ddan, acceptance of the differentiation between the two fields is also manifest in the clear distinction between the practice of moral \nguidance on the one hand and medical activities in the PL Hospital \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n28  I thank Nina Rageth for inspiring me to apply Fligstein and McAdam\u2019s concept \nof the strategic action field (2012). As a consequence, these authors figure prom-inently in both our articles.  Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 73 \n(http://www.plhospital.or.jp, July 4, 2018) and the health centers in Tokyo \n(the PL Tokyo Kenk\u014d Kanri Sent \u0101; http://www.pl-tokyo-kenkan.gr.jp, July \n4, 2018) and Osaka on the other hand. These institutions rely completely on biomedical expertise and modern medical technology. Accordingly, reli-\ngious teachers who accept and forward requests for mioshie are urged to em-\nphasize that mioshie  does not primarily have curing functions but is a means \nto realize moral conduct in accordance with one\u2019s nature (P \u0101fekuto Ribat \u012b \nKy\u014ddan Bunky\u014d ka 1991: 184\u2013185).  \nIn sum, since both types of actor propagate religious or moral practices \nbased on the authority of their religious status (Buddhist priest, religious teacher, head of PL Ky\u014ddan) and act in religious spaces (Buddhist temple or \nPL church), they can be said to position themselves as actors in their respec-tive fields, namely Japanese Buddhism and PL Ky \u014ddan, or in the wider field \nof religion. \nFrom this position, however, they claim that their religious or moral pr ac-\ntice has therapeutic effects in a practical, not a metaphorical sense. In \nKageyama\u2019s case, this claim is clearly aimed to redefine the purpose of the \nfield of Buddhism and to (re-)establish Buddhism as a medical tradition, hence integrating medical functions into the religious field. In contrast, PL Ky\u014ddan publications emphasize that healing is just a side effect, not the in-tended goal of moral practice. In both cases, however, therapeutic claims are supported on the level of semantics. Kageyama\u2019s writings and PL Ky\u014ddan\u2019s \ncommunicative practices are both characterized by particular ways of switch-\ning between \u201creligious language\u201d and \u201cmedical language\u201d, understood here as the vocabulary, idioms, or linguistic registers (i.e. ways of talking and writing) of the respective semantic fields of medicine and religion. Based on these observations, I will introduce two forms of strategic action that aim to legitimize claims to therapeutic authority: (1) Scientification and (2) Code-\nswitching between the religious and medical semantic fields. \n \n5.1  Form s of Strategic Action: Scientification  \n \n5.1.1  Kageyama Ky\u014dshun  \n Scientification here denotes reference to scientific knowledge, institutions, and practices by religious actors in order to legitimize religious knowledge and practices. This strategy is a main characteristic of Kageyama Ky\u014dshun\u2019s 74 | Monika Schrimpf  \nwritings. His justification for a scientific explanation of Buddhist practice \ncontains a harsh critique of the forced separation of medicine and Buddhism in Japan\u2019s early Meiji era and of the prevalent mode of knowledge as repre-sented in the academic culture. Due to the Westernization of Japan in early \nmodern times, he argues, the emotional culture ( kansei no bunka) of Japan \nas manifest in the premodern medical tradition of \u201cnourishing life\u201d ( y\u014dj\u014d \niry\u014d) has been replaced by the rational culture ( risei no bunka) of the \u201cWest\u201d \nas represented in modern biomedicine. For him, emotional cultures are char-\nacterized by a mode of knowledge in which tradition is transmitted via emo-tion: \u201cHow are matters of tradition felt, how are they reflected in oneself?\u201d \n(Kageyama 2007: 24). In constrast, in a rational culture, the dominant mode \nof knowledge rests on intellectual understanding and explanation, as well as on empirical knowledge (Kageyama 2007: 21\u201323). As a consequence, alt-hough Buddhist culture represents the original emotional culture of Japan, nowadays it is perceived as a primarily textual tradition\u2014Buddhism has lost its \u201cphysicality\u201d ( shintaisei ) (Kageyama 2007:  24).  Therefore,  although  Bu-\ndhist  truth can only be grasped through experience, Kageyama must refer to \nthe language of the sciences in order to explain the essence of Buddhism (Kageyama 2007: 31).  \nIn considering the appropriate science, Kageyama argues that Buddhism \nwas originally not a scholarly tradition, but a form of psychotherapy. \u201cAt present, Buddhism is approached as philosophy, but considering that Bud-\ndhism actually aims at resolving people\u2019s sorrows and sufferings, it is not \nphilosophy but rather psychotherapy.\u201d (Kageyama 2013: 19) The psycho-therapeutic and general medical quality he ascribes to Buddhist practice re-sults from the fact that, at its core, Buddhism is practice ( shugy \u014d) and expe-\nrience, rather than a tradition of scholarship. It must therefore be approached through mental and physical experience, that is, by means of sensory percep-\ntion and the emotions aroused by it.\n29 Consequently, a science which pro-\nvides appropriate tools to explain Buddhist practice must consider both the \nphysical and the intellectual aspects: \n  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n29  \u201cEmotional cultures such as Buddhism must be approached via a mode of \nknowledge in which someone knows by experience; by means of one\u2019s body, i.e. one\u2019s senses, someone knows how he feels and what mood arises\u201d (Kageyama 2007: 24).  dMedical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 75 \n\u201cBecause in this sense Buddhist practice is the attempt to master (taitoku ) true \nknowledge by means of mind and body, physiological -psychological researc h into \nmethods of Buddhist practice represents a research attitude in accordance with the \nmetaphysical particularities of Buddhist thought.\u201d (Kageyama 2007: 35)  \n \nFor example, he introduces Hans Selye\u2019s (1907\u20131982) theory of stress reac-\ntions and the concept of homeostasis as developed by physiologist Walter Bradford Cannon (1871\u20131945) to clarify the physiological conditions of stress before explaining how the methods of \u201ccalming the mind and insight meditation\u201d ( shikan, Skt. \u015bamatha  and vipa\u015b yan\u0101) impact upon them by \ncalming the body, the mind, and breathing (Kageyama 2013: 28\u201348). He also compares these meditation techniques to autogenic training as expounded by psychiatrists Johannes Schultz (1884\u20131970) and Wolfgang Luthe (1922\u20131985) (Kageyama 2013: 93\u2013117). In more concrete terms, Kageyama ex-plains and graphically illustrates the measured correlation of time spent in meditation with the frequency of brain waves and heart rates and links it to \nfour temporal phases in autogenic training (2013: 118\u2013123). In this argu-\nment, the slowing down of the heart rate and brain waves measured ten minutes after starting meditation is said to coincide with inducement of the meditative state of zenna (Skt. dhy\u0101na), in which one sits in quiet observation \nof one\u2019s own self- reflection (Kageyama 2013: 156). Finally, the changed \nself-perception (the expansion of consciousness) in shikan meditation is \ncompared to Stanislav Grof\u2019s notion of transpersonal experiences and Abra-ham Maslow\u2019s concept of self-actualization (Kageyama 2013: 134\u2013139)\n30.  \nSimilar to Mikael Rothstein\u2019s observation concerning how and why new \nreligions emphasize their scientific character, Kageyama\u2019s choice of the \u201cphysiological-psychological\u201d sciences reflects his agenda of supporting re-ligious authority vis-\u00e0-vis scientifically based authority claims in the field of \nmedicine. \u201cIt is, as we shall see, religion, not science, which defines the \nstandards in the interaction between the two systems: Science, in the scien-tific sense of the word, has been largely substituted by a mythological ren-dering of the same concept.\u201d (Rothstein 2004: 101) Although Kageyama\u2019s concept of science is by no means mythological, his choice of scientists, in-cluding proponents of transpersonal psychology, serves his aim of providing \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n30  See Stephanie Gripentrog\u2019s analysis of religious elements in Maslow\u2019s and Grof\u2019s \ncontribution to Transpersonal Psychology in this volume.  76 | Monika Schrimpf  \nscientific proof of the physical, psychological, and ultimately medical impact \nof Buddhist practice very well.  \nThis interpretation of Buddhism brings Kageyama\u2019s concept of \u201cBud-\ndhism as meditation techniques\u201d close to what Lorne Dawson calls \u201cthe new \nreligious consciousness\u201d (2006: 183)31 as a kind of \u201ccultural [\u2026] resource \npool\u201d (Robbins/Bromley as cited in Dawson 2006: 186), parts of which are \nactualized in different social settings. Similar to this notion of an individual-istic, experience-based religiosity resting on a holistic worldview, Kageyama emphasizes experience as the only way of grasping the essence of Buddhism and advocates Buddhist practice as a means to re-establish the unity of mind \nand body. This topos of mind-body unity is a basic concept in the assoc ia-\ntions of integrative or holistic medicine mentioned above, as well as in the \ncontext of the California Institute for Human Science: its basic principles include \u201cTo Understand Human Existence from the Total Perspective of Body, Mind and Spirit\u201d.\n32 As such, mind-body unity is a modern rhetoric \nprojected back on to premodern forms of medicine. Neither in Buddhist med-\nicine nor in Japanese kanp \u014d does the juxtaposition of mind and body play \nany role.  \nIn sum, Kageyama\u2019s strategy of scientification serves a double aim: (1) \nto legitimize his claim that Buddhist practices have medico-therapeutical ef-\nfects by expressing them in scientific terms; and (2) as a consequence, to upgrade Buddhism as a tradition serving not only the religious goal of awak-\nening, but also the physical goal of a healthy body and mind. His concept of \nBuddhism as a religion serving \u201cthis-worldly\u201d interests, such as a healthy life, creates a counterimage to the negative image of Buddhism in Japanese \npublic; the widely used term \u201cfuneral Buddhism\u201d ( s\u014dshiki Bukky \u014d) implies \nthat many priests see their main function in providing expensive funerary \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n31  Dawson describes this kind of contemporary religiosity as a cultural resource \nmanifest for example in new religious movements, new religious networks, client \nreligions etc. To him, it is characterized by religious individualism, emphasis on \nexperience, i.e., \u201cintense experiences of themselves and the sacred\u201d (2006: 183), \nauthority based on \u201cskill development\u201d rather than scriptures or revelation, toler-ance of other religious perspectives, a holistic worldview, and \u201corganizational openness\u201d (2006: 184).  \n32  http://www.cihs.edu /index.php/about -cihs/principles -of-cihs/ , July 4, 2018.  Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 77 \nrituals to increase their wealth.33 Therefore, the use of scientific language is \napplied here as a means to advocate and legitimize a new concept of Bud-\ndhism that defies its public image. As noted by Rothstein, it is a kind of le-gitimization that no modern religion can avoid: \u201cNo religion of the modern \nworld will successfully be able to claim authority without some kind of sci-\nentific legitimization.\u201d (Rothstein 2004: 102) \n \n5.1.2  Perfect Liberty Ky\u014ddan  \n For the same reason, I argue, the value of science, especially of the medical \nand natural sciences, is strongly emphasized in the case of Perfect Liberty \nKy\u014ddan. As explained in its introductory guidebook for believers, \u201cthe unity of religion and science\u201d ( sh\u016bky \u014d to kagaku wa itchi suru) is a basic convic-\ntion propagated in the community. Accordingly, PL Ky\u014ddan runs several sci-entific and medical institutions; a General Research Center ( PL s \u014dg\u014d \nkenky \u016bsho), the PL Hospital ( PL by \u014din), and two PL health centers ( PL kenk \u014d \nkanri sent \u0101) in Tokyo and Osaka. The tasks of the General Research Center \ncomprise \u201canalysing psychic sources of injuries and illness, providing a da-tabase concerning doctrines and propagation, [and] rationalizing and in creas-\ning the efficiency of office work\u201d (P \u0101fekuto Ribat \u012b Ky\u014ddan Bunky\u014dbu 2008: \n27). At the same time, its aim to scientifically prove doctrinal statements is emphasized: \n  \n\u201cIn the field of medicine, we conduct research on the topic of bad habits and illness \n(kokoroguse to by\u014d ki), based on the truth of divine notices ( mishirase ) and divine in-\nstructions (mioshie ); and in the field of education, we conduct research on the topic \nof parent -child relations and human relations, based on the teaching that children are \na mirror of their parents.\u201d (P \u0101fekuto Ribat \u012b Ky\u014ddan Bunky \u014dbu 2008: 27)  \n \nAs these quotes indicate, scientific institutions and scientific knowledge are \nhighly valued both as a means to support the religious organization and to prove its truth claims, and they are said to rest ultimately on religious truths. This linking of religious and scientific truth is also reflected in the short text introducing the PL hospital: \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n33  For an analysis of the role scholarship has played in the emergence of the popular \nimage of a corrupt, degenerate temple Buddhism, see Covell 2005: 11 \u201322. 78 | Monika Schrimpf  \n\u201cNo matter how well we are equipped with excellent technical devices, and how much \nwe improve medical techniques, since we are human beings we cannot avoid mistakes. \nTherefore, those in a position to take care of other peoples\u2019 lives cannot but conduct \nmedical treatment with the following praying mind: \u2018We do our best to make sure, \nand we d o what is humanly possible, but beyond this we rely on god with all our \nhearts.\u2019\u201d (P \u0101fekuto Ribat \u012b Ky\u014d dan Bunky\u014dbu 2008: 27)  \n \nObviously, in this introductory guidebook, the relationship between science \nand religion is evaluated from a religious perspective. By addressing a reli-gious audience, emphasizing the superiority of god\u2019s actions over human ac-\ntions, and stressing the scientific truth of their religious doctrines, the authors \nare acting in accordance with the rules of legitimate action in the religiou s \nfield. Relating science to religion in this way is a communicative strategy with the intention to strengthen the authority of religion by and in relation to science. By means of this strategy, an ambiguous relationship between the two fields is created. On the one hand, the legitimizing power of science is \naccepted; on the other hand, the superiority of divine action over human ac-\ntion is claimed, thus reversing the relationship. \nThis strategy is not applied in the context of medical institutions. The \nwebs ite of the PL Hospital addresses potential patients rather than PL mem-\nbers or the religious in general. The language of the website conforms to the norms of communication in the field of medicine with regard to both, its \ncontents and its use of medical terminology. As on any other hospital web-\nsite, the hospital units and their recent activities, the technological equipment they use, their medical services, ethics in dealing with patients etc. are de-scribed. The only reference to religious concepts is made in the section on \u201cHospital guidelines,\u201d where one finds not only an extended version of the PL motto \u201cLife is Art\u201d, namely \u201cLife is Art\u2014So is Medicine\u201d and a commit-\nment to the ultimate reliance on god when men reach their limits, but also \nthe statement that \u201cmedical treatment rests on PL principles\u201d (http://www. plhospital.or.jp/contents/gNavi4/hosin.html, July 4, 2018). Although the connection with PL Ky\u014d dan as a religious group is clearly stated, the actual \nmeaning of the \u201cPL principles\u201d and their relevance for the hospital remain vague. In this institutional context, the purpose of the medical field is \nacknowledged and its rules are applied with regard to medical practice as \nwell as language use. Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 79 \nBoth cases show that religious actors pursue a strategy of scientifically \nvalidating therapeutical claims, thus supporting Mikael Rothstein\u2019s judge-\nment, mentioned above, that every modern religion needs scientific legitimi-zation in order to claim authority for itself. In the case of PL Ky \u014ddan, scien-\ntification as a means of legitimization is complemented by its attempt to es-tablish itself institutionally in the medical field. However, representatives of these institutions act as medical actors, thus complying with the semantics of the medical field.  \n  5.2  Forms of Strategic Action: Code -switching between the  \nReligious and Medical Semantic F ields  \n \nAnother strategy I observed among religious actors is a kind of code-switch-ing between the semantic fields of religion and medicine in order to create a \nfunctional hierarchy. Although linguistically code-switching denotes \u201cthe \njuxtaposition of elements from two (or more) languages or dialects\u201d (McCor-mick 1994: 581), it is used here in a wider sense as switching between se-mantic fields. By semantic field, I refer to specific vocabulary, idiomatic ex-pressions, and linguistic registers, such as special terminology, as well as codified ways of speaking or writing, for example, between doctor and pa-\ntient, religious expert and believer etc. \nSemantic fields in this sense are understood as part of the tool kits of the \nstrategic action field of religion or the subfields of Japanese Buddhism and \nPL Ky\u014ddan, and medicine. Tool kits are defined by Ann Swidler (1986) as \nhabits, skills, meanings, linguistic repertoires etc. that are available to actors in their respective social contexts. Individual and collective actors develop \nstrategies of action by selecting from these cultural repertoires and by inter-\npreting their actions in specific ways (Swidler 1986: 281\u2013283). \nIn the two cases discussed here, the question arises why religious actors \nselect from the linguistic tools of the semantic field of medicine and combine them with elements of their own religious linguistic repertoires. Do they want to position themselves as actors in the medical field? I argue that, rather than \npositioning themselves in another field, they apply this strategy as a means \nof strengthening  the position of their own field in relation to that of medicine.  \nLet us look first at the case of Perfect Liberty Ky\u014ddan. The procedures of \nasking for divine instruction ( mioshie ) concerning a disease, injury or other 80 | Monika Schrimpf  \nphysical affliction involve religious semantics as well as medical semantics. \nIf a member asks for mioshie , he or she hands over a standardized \u201cplea for \nmioshie \u201d to the local church. Beforehand, he or she will have prayed in a \nritualized way and promised to apply the contents of the divine instruction in \nhis or her daily life. The religious teacher who receives this plea inquires \ndiligently about the member\u2019s marital status, family members, job, duration of membership etc., and describes the symptoms and course of the disease in great detail (P \u0101fekuto Ribat \u012b Ky\u014ddan Bunky\u014dka 1991:183\u2013186, 195\u2013279).  \nThis comprehensive information is then sent to the headquarters in Ton-\ndabayashi, where Miki Takahito, the head of PL Ky\u014ddan, or those religious \nteachers who are able to receive mioshie , write down the specific divine in-\nstruction and send it back to the local church. Again, the member has to pray \nin formalized words before receiving the envelope with the mioshie  from a \nlocal religious teacher. After three days of reflecting about the meaning and the individual application of the mioshie , the member visits a religious \nteacher to ask him for his assessment ( kaisetsu) and to discuss possible ways \nof realizing the mioshie  in everyday life (P \u0101fekuto Ribat \u012b Ky\u014ddan Bunky\u014d ka \n1991: 186\u2013189).  \nNotwithstanding the ritualistic language register manifest in prayers and \nformalized phrases when receiving the plea and handing over the mioshie , \ncode-switching to medical language occurs in the religious teacher\u2019s detailed recording of the symptoms, the course of the disease, the diagnosis by a phy-\nsician, and the prescribed treatment. The manual for religious teachers illus-\ntrates how the symptoms of various diseases are to be described in great de-tail and how their location is to be marked on a drawing of the human body. For example, in the case of a rash, the person is asked whether she or he experiences hot flushes at night, and whether the symptoms increase when the person is exposed to cold wind; in case of sinusitis the believer is asked \nhow the nasal mucus smells, how it affects the sense of smell, and whether it \ncauses headaches; in case of an accident, the course of events must be de-scribed precisely etc. (P \u0101fekuto Ribat \u012b Ky\u014ddan Bunky\u014dka 1991: 231\u2013239).  \nIn this communication, religious teacher and believer imitate a conversa-\ntion between a doctor and a patient. Whereas previously their communication was in line with the linguistic registers of religious believer and teacher, they \nnow switch into the communicative mode of a medical anamnesis performed \nby a doctor with a patient (P \u0101fekuto Ribat \u012b Ky\u014d dan Bunky\u014dka 1991: 183\u2013\n185). By using this kind of medical communication in order to document the Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 81 \nsymptoms of a disease or injury and by framing it using religious concepts \nthat explain the occurence of the symptoms, different functions are assigned to medical and religious language respectively: medical language serves to label and locate the symptoms physically, whereas religious language se rves \nto explain the actual causes of the disease and to indicate ways of healing it. Thus, a hierarchical relationship is constructed, in which religious concepts are assigned a superior position. \nA similar strategy is followed by Kageyama in his explanations for actual \ndiseases. On the general level, he ascribes the increase of so-called lifestyle diseases such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cerebrovascular diseases, \nheart diseases, cancer, allergies, rashes, high blood pressure, eating disorders \netc. to the separation of mind and body as characteristic of contemporary \u201ccompetitive societies\u201d (2013: 36). This separation creates stress, the main cause of all the diseases mentioned above, and can be countered by medita-tion techniques which reinstate the unity of mind and body (Kageyama 2013: 28\u201336). In explaining actual diseases, he sometimes blends religious con-\ncepts with physiological effects in a way that assigns them different func-\ntions. The following is part of his explanation for what causes chronic rheu-matism and rheumatic arthritis, a disease that afflicts mostly women in the second half of their lives.  \n \n\u201cIn the minds of women who suffer from rheumatic arthritis, suppressed contradictory \nemotions are hidden. In Buddhism we call these \u201cdust accumulati ng passions\u201d; this \nexpression describes a state in which the mind, which is originally as pure as the Bud-\ndha nature, in the process of its development has been polluted by dirt. This aggressive karma ( g\u014d), in neurophysiological terms, stimulates the sympat hetic nervous system \nand manifests itself in a muscular tension. By suppressing this strong impulse in order to stop it, the tension of the adversary muscle which is connected to the originally \ntense muscle is also intensified. As a consequence, the contra ction caused by the ten-\nsion of the adversary muscle group damages the joints, and the physical basis causing \nrheumatism is revealed.\u201d (Kageyama 2010: 111)  \n \nIn this example, medical terminology and explanations are used to describe a disease as a physiological process, whereas religious terminology\u2014the \nconcepts of passion ( bonn \u014d), Buddha nature ( bussh\u014d) and karma ( g\u014d)\u2014are \napplied to explain its real cause. To Kageyama, a woman\u2019s contradictory \nurges to dominate and to protect cause aggressive karma. Buddhist prayers 82 | Monika Schrimpf  \n(kit\u014d) and invoking the title of the Lotus Sutra are advocated as means to \npurify this negative karma, resulting in a relaxation of the muscles and a sta-\nbilization of the vegetative nervous system (Kageyama 2010: 114).  \nAs in the case of PL Ky\u014ddan, medical terminology is incorporated here \nand assigned the inferior function of explaining organic processes and rela-tionships, in which it is framed by religious concepts which provide an ex-planation for what causes these physical effects in the context of a Buddhist notion of man and fate. In this way, religious knowledge and practice, whether Buddhist or new religious, is depicted as superior when it comes to understanding the causes of diseases. \n  \n6  CONCLUSION  \n \nNeither Kageyama nor the religious teachers in PL Ky\u014ddan make use of the \nlinguistic tool kit of the field of medicine or apply scientific reasoning in \norder to compete with medical actors in their respective field. Kageyama does not challenge medical experts by setting up an institution of alternative medical practice or by actually becoming involved in contemporary medical-scientific discourses. PL Ky\u014ddan does have its own medical institutions, but they operate according to the rules of the medical field. Here, the specifically \nreligious interpretation and subsequent treatment of illness are considered to \nbe complementary practices. \nRather, Kageyama and PL Ky\u014d dan\u2019s religious teachers use medical or \nallegedly scientific language to legitimize, within the religious field, their claims that religious practice also fulfills therapeutical functions. In this sense, Kageyama and PL Ky\u014ddan both represent one way of bridging the gap \nbetween scientific medicine and their own therapeutic practices. They advo-\ncate an understanding of \u201cthe purposes of the field\u201d (Fligstein/McAdam 2012: 9), which includes the goal of a healthy body and mind in the literal sense. By doing so, they re-claim a premodern or \u2018pre-differentiated\u2019 under-standing of religions and their \u201cpurposes\u201d in which medical care was a fun-damental task of their respective religious communities. However, they do \nnot propagate to simply return to this previous state and replace scientific \nmedical authority by religious medical authority. Instead, they qualify their therapeutical techniques as compatible with science, thus acknowledging the Medical Discourses and Practices in Japanese Religions | 83 \nsuperiority of scientific medicine, while at the same time dissolving the \nboundaries between it and their own activities.  \nIn this sense, scientification and code-switching between medical and re-\nligious language are used to strengthen the position and influence of religions \nin contemporary Japanese society. They aim to re-establish the relevance of \nreligious traditions as (complementary) medical traditions via illustrating their compatibility with scientific-medical knowledge and the superiority of religious over medical explanatory models. \nThe strategies of scientific legitimization and code-switching applied in \nthe two examples also shed light on possible ways in which religious actors \nmay conceptualize the relationship between the two fields. On the one hand, \nthe religious field\u2014assuming it includes medical functions\u2014is seen as being in a dependent relationship (Fligstein/McAdam 2012: 18 \u201319) with the med-\nical field. Although Kageyama extensively describes premodern Buddhist medical knowledge in times when medicine and religion were not yet differ-entiated, this traditional knowledge gains relevance for the present only if it \nis validated by contemporary medical-scientific knowledge. This conceptu-\nalization clearly reflects the relationship on the social level, where medical experts do not require religious legitimization, but religious actors cannot claim medical authority without referring to the tool kit of medicine. Or, in Rothstein\u2019s terms: \u201cReligion has the ability to transform science into some-thing useful for its purpose, while science usually is deprived of the possibil-\nity of transforming religion into something scientifically meaningful\u201d (2004: \n102). \nOn the other hand, in the internal discourse, an interdependent relation-\nship is conceptualized by means of functional hierarchization according to which religious doctrines are claimed to provide the ultimate explanation of what causes illness. In this way, the one-sided dependence of religion on the \nsocial level is counteracted.  \n \n \nBIBLIOGRAPHY  \n \nAhn, Juhn Y.

It focuses on the tension and co -\nconstitution of the figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner and the college -edu-\ncated Siddha practitioner. Based on ethnographic interviews conducted in South India, \nit analyzes how the figure  of the hereditary Siddha practitioner is semantically delin-\neated in the aftermath of the formal professionalization of Siddha medicine. Based on \nthe assumption that practices of self -representation and broader social structures form \na constitutive relationship, it discusses the interlocutors\u2019 accounts as semantic posi-tionings in a \u2018strategic action field\u2019 (Fligstein/McAdam 2012). Accordingly, the arti-\ncle suggests that the interlocutors\u2019 distinct  self-fashioning, especially their appropria-\ntion and fusion of  religious and scientific semantics, be conceptualized as a strategic \nimprovisation that establishes and ensures them a favorable position in this particular social field.  \n  92 | Nina Rageth \n1  INTRODUCTION  \n \nSiddha medicine ( citta maruttuvam ) is a medical system mainly practiced in \nthe Tamil-speaking areas of South India.1 According to emic accounts by \ncontemporary Siddha practitioners, the medical system is of divine prove-\nnance, having been discovered by the god \u015aiva and revealed by him to the \nsiddhars ( cittarka\u1e37 ), \u201cthe ancient supernatural spiritual saints of India\u201d2, who \nin turn introduced the Siddha knowledge to the human realm.3 Today, Siddha \nmedicine is recognized by the Indian government as a traditional Indian med-ical system and has been integrated into the public health service. In the late colonial period and in the context of the policy of \u201cstate-sponsored medical pluralism\u201d (Sujatha/Abraham 2009: 35), Siddha medicine underwent a pro-cess of formal professionalization along \u201cmodernist lines\u201d (Habib/Raina 2005: 74). This process entailed the introduction of a standardized college \neducation modelled on the biomedical paradigm, the reworking of Siddha \nmedical knowledge in accordance with scientific principles, a differentiation between qualified and non-qualified practitioners through registration and official certificates such as the Bachelor\u2019s in Siddha Medicine and Surgery (BSMS), and the regulation of Siddha medical practices, especially in the production of pharmaceuticals (cp. Hausman 1996; S\u00e9bastia 2012a, 2012b; \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1  In accordance with the convention in English academic publications, I use the \nSanskrit term siddha  rather than Tamil citta to refer to the medical tradition. Fur-\nthermore, following conventions in English publications, I use siddhar and not \nthe Sanskrit siddha  or Tamil cittar  to refer to the alleged authors of the Siddha \nliterature and the founders of Siddha medicine. A further note on transliteration: \nTamil terms are transliterated according to their Tamil forms. However, terms which are more commonly used in their Sanskrit versions, I have tr ansliterated \naccording to the Sanskrit spelling (e.g. gurukula  instead of kurukulam , do\u1e63a in-\nstead of t\u014dcam, \u015b\u0101stra instead of c\u0101stiram , \u015biva  instead of civa \u1e49). Plural forms of \nIndian terms are marked by the suffix \u2013s instead of the Tamil plural suffix -ka\u1e37 \n(e.g. pa\u00f1cap \u016btas instead of pa\u00f1cap \u016bta\u1e45ka\u1e37). I render place names and personal \nnames in their usual English spellings.  \n2  http://www.siddhavaidyam.com/Origin_of_SiddhaMedicine.html , August 18 , \n2017.  \n3  For scholarly work on the Siddhars, see White 1996;  Venkatraman 1990; Zvelebil \n1973, 1974, 1996.  Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 93 \n \n Sieler 2015; Weiss 2009). The formal professionalization of Siddha medicine \nled to the establishment of a secularized institution, which I refer to in this article as \u201cthe college institution.\u201d This professionalization also led to the appearance of a new figure in the medical field, whom in this article I c all \n\u201cthe college-trained practitioner.\u201d The college institution is sufficiently pow-erful to sanction what constitutes genuine Siddha medical knowledge and Siddha medical practice and to define the criteria for occupational closure. Moreover, it is in a position to undermine the authority of the previous au-thoritative institution, which I call \u201cthe gurukula institution.\u201d\n4 \nThis article looks at a particular figure that has emerged under these \nchanging social conditions and that has become effective in opposition to the college-trained practitioner. I refer to this figure as \u201cthe hereditary Siddha practitioner.\u201d Hereditary Siddha practitioners depict themselves as represent-atives of the gurukula institution, which, they claim, has preserved the \u201creal\u201d Siddha knowledge, the \u201cdivine science\u201d\n5, and which has transmitted this \nknowledge within lineages (paramparai) of physicians from teachers to ini-\ntiated students until the recent establishment of college education and the \nmainstreaming of an altered version of the siddhars\u2019 original knowledge. On the basis of self-descriptive accounts of seven contemporary Siddha practi-tioners who identify with the figure of the hereditary practitioner, the article analyzes how my interlocutors frame the figure of the hereditary prac ti-\ntioner.\n6 The article examines the self-fashioning of the hereditary practitioner \nin the current medical landscape, as well as the fashioning of the traditional Siddha medicine, that is, following Habib and Raina (2005: 76), of the \u201ccon-temporary practitioners\u2019 traditional medicine.\u201d The term \u201cself-fashioning\u201d has been chosen to emphasize the strategic orchestration involved in the con-struction of the figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner. In adopting the term, I aim to highlight the proposition that my interlocutors\u2019 self-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n4  A gurukula  is traditionally a school where the disciples live together with their \nteacher.  \n5  http://www.devavidya.com/vision.html, September 29 , 2016.  \n6  The term \u201cframing\u201d features prominently in the social sciences i n areas as differ-\nent as ritual theories (Goffman 1974) and media theories (Gamson 1985). How-\never, I use the term in its everyday meaning of \u201cdelineating ,\u201d \u201cdescribing ,\u201d or \n\u201claying out ,\u201d without reference to any particular academic debate.  94 | Nina Rageth \nrepresentations are consciously fabricated within the structuring framework \nof their social position.7 \nThe first part of the article describes how the figure of the hereditary Sid-\ndha practitioner is semantically fashioned by examining the construction of \nthe symbolic boundaries between this figure and its \u201cconstitutive outside\u201d \n(Hall 2003: 17, emphasis in the original). Special attention is given to the application of religious semantics and the emphasis on tradition in the self-descriptive accounts of my interlocutors. In the second part, the article dis-cusses the social structures within which the figure emerges and suggests interpreting the specific self-fashioning as a semantic positioning in a \u201cstra-\ntegic action field\u201d (Fligstein/McAdam 2012). The article engages with Bour-\ndieu\u2019s stance that the \u201cconstruction [of social reality] is not carried out in a social vacuum but subjected to structural constraints\u201d (Bourdieu 1989: 18). It argues that the figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner emerges within the contextual conditions of the professionalization of Siddha medicine and that the college-trained practitioner creates the foil against which this figure \nbecomes meaningful. Consequently, the article does not focus on the com-\npetition between Siddha medicine and biomedicine, but examines issues re-lated to competition within the domain of Siddha medicine itself. In doing so, it fills a gap identified by the historian of religion, Richard Weiss (2009: 201). The article argues that, under conditions of the professionalization of Siddha medicine, the religious semantics and the emphasis on tradition ap-\npear as a mode of cultural production which becomes effective in the self-\nfashioning of the position of the hereditary Siddha practitioner. The replace-ment of the gurukula institution by the secularized college institution favors, so to speak, the appropriation of religious argumentation and the rhetoric of tradition as a means whereby a distinct social group attempts to provide its knowledge with authority and to attain a different status in the social field. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n7  The term \u201cself -fashioning\u201d loosely reflects the term \u201cobjective self -fashioning\u201d \ncoined by the medical anthropologist Joseph Dumit. While Dumit uses the latter \nterm to analyze how the understanding of the biological self, the \u201cperson, body, brain, and mind\u201d (2010:  368), are actively and continually produced, I use the \nterm \u201cself -fashioning\u201d to point to the ways in which a position in a social field is \nproduced.  Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 95 \n \n 2  ETHNOGRAPHIC MATERIA L:  \nSAMPLE AND ANALYSIS \n \nThis article is based on material generated in the exploratory phase of my \nPhD project, which stretched over a period of four years (2014 to 2018).8 The \nmain sources for this article are informal conversations and ethnographic in-terviews with Siddha practitioners conducted between December 2014 and February 2015. Ethnographic interviews are unstructured and open inter-\nviews which do not follow a set pattern but respond to the particular situation \nin which they take place. Also, they typically resemble an everyday conver-sation, yet without the back and forth characteristic of this type of social in-teraction (Schlehe 2003: 72). A further source are the webpage texts of my interlocutors. Furthermore, the tool of ethnographic observation was used during fieldwork in order to see what people do and what kind of infrastruc-\nture they use for their actions (cp. Bernard 2011). However, since this artic le \nis mainly concerned with semantics rather than practice, the data I generated \nthrough observational techniques come into play only marginally in the pre-sent article. \nThe sample consists of Siddha practitioners who present themselves as \nhereditary Siddha practitioners. \u201cHereditary Siddha practitioner\u201d is a term I \nintroduce to capture and subsume the emic terminology I encountered in the \nfield, such as \u201ctraditional vaittiyar  (physician)\u201d (Anbarasi), \u201ctraditional ex-\nperts\u201d (Prem Nath), \u201ctraditional practitioner\u201d (Prem Nath), \u201c p\u0101rampariya  \n(traditional) doctors\u201d (Surendran), \u201c paramparaiy \u0101\u1e49a vaittiyar  (hereditary \npractitioner)\u201d (Kapilan) or \u201cthe real Siddha doctor\u201d (Devanesan). I conducted ethnographic interviews with seven practitioners, six men and one woman \n(Anbarasi), one in Tamil (Kapilan), the others in English, or more precisely \nwith English as the foundational language interwoven with Tamil, which proved to be the most convenient mode for conducting the interviews for everybody involved. All the interviews were conducted in the clinics of my interlocutors. The interlocutors share some basic socio-demographics. They are all around forty years old and live in towns in the southern Indian state \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n8  The doctoral thesis focuses on the intersection of Hindu guru organizations and \nSiddha medicine in pres ent-day South India. The research was generously sup-\nported by the University Research Priority Program Asia and Europe,  University \nof Zurich and funded by the Humer Foundation.  96 | Nina Rageth \nof Tamil Nadu. The exception is Prem Nath, who lives in Kerala in an area \npopulated by both Malayalis and Tamils. Prem Nath comes from a Tamil family, and the circumstance that he lives in Kerala does not make his situa-tion different from those of the other interlocutors.\n9 My interlocutors also \nshare similarities with regard to their medical practice. They all run their own clinics ( vaittiyac \u0101lai), and they all produce medical drugs ( maruntu), which, \nas they state, are based on formulas inherited from their gurus. The clinics are small -scale settings, and my interlocutors cater to as many as forty pa-\ntients a day. In all the settings, consultation is free of charge, but the costs of the drugs have to be covered by the patients. Apart from two practitioners \n(Anbarasi and Surendran) who run a business selling drugs to retailers, the \ndrugs are exclusively dispensed to the practitioners\u2019 own patients. Moreover, my interlocutors share themes in their self-representation. They all state that they see their work as their duty to keep Siddha medicine from vanishing. They argue that the Indian government\u2019s recognition of their medical system and its integration into the public health sector has not benefitted Siddha \nmedicine but rather has had adverse effects on it. The most important shared \nelement in their self-representation for the argument I develop in this article is that they all identify with the hereditary Siddha practitioners and strongly distinguish themselves from college-trained practitioners. While they de-scribe themselves as practicing Siddha medicine \u201cthe traditional way\u201d (Devanesan), applying \u201cthe traditional method\u201d (Surendran), and having \n\u201ctraditional knowledge\u201d (Prem Nath), they describe the college-trained prac-\ntitioners as practicing \u201cmodern\u201d (Devanesan) or \u201cregular\u201d (Anbarasi, Suren-dran) Siddha medicine, and as going the \u201cacademic way\u201d and following the \u201cuniversity model\u201d or the \u201ceducational system\u201d (Prem Nath). My interlocu-tors claim that they, on the contrary, learnt the \u201creal\u201d Siddha medicine out-side modern college institutions with a guru. Three of my interlocutors (Prem \nNath, Avalok, Rubendran) stated that they hail from Siddha physician fami-\nlies and that they studied with their grandfathers and fathers, whereas the other four interlocutors learnt Siddha medicine with a guru outside their fam-ily. One of my interlocutors (Kapilan) framed this distinction in terms of karuva\u1e3b i and kuruva\u1e3b i, that is, entering a gurukula  by birth ( karuva\u1e3b i, the way \nof the embryo) or by initiation ( kuruva\u1e3b i, the way of the guru). \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n9  Prem Nath did not wish to be anonymized. The other interlocutors have been \ngiven pseudonyms.  Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 97 \n \n It should be noted, however, that, in addition to their training with a guru, \nmy interlocutors have also earned certified medical degrees, a prerequisite to \npracticing medicine legally in contemporary India.10 From an analytical point \nof view, the fact that my interlocutors earned certified diplomas makes their \nself-representation as non-college-trained practitioners appear contradictory. \nHowever, what is important for the argument I develop in this article is that, \nregardless of the certified diplomas which they hold, they fashion themselves as hereditary Siddha practitioners and distance themselves from practitioners who only learnt Siddha medicine in college and who do not have access to any other source of medical knowledge. \nThe method used in analyzing the data follows the paradigm of theoreti-\ncal coding and the analytical method of grounded theory  (cp. Glaser 1978). \nTheoretical coding is a reconstructive method that aims to identify concepts in the material from which more abstract categories are developed. These abstract categories serve as a tool with which to organize the material and present it analytically. The categories are derived from the analysis of the \nmaterial obtained during fieldwork. The dominant categories in the material \nserve as the basis for the construction of the ideal type of the hereditary Sid-dha practitioner I discuss in this article. The ideal type is not identical with empirical types; rather, it is to be understood as a generalization of the dom-inant features that are present in my interlocutors\u2019 accounts.\n11 My interlocu-\ntors show these features to varying degrees, which will be indicated in the \nanalysis. As should become clear with regard to the limited size of the sam-\nple, this study is conceptualized as a case study which does not speak for a larger whole, yet which is a valuable means of exploring trends in a specific group and thus of diversifying the existing academic discourse. However, \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n10  Two of my interlocutors (Anbarasi and Surendran) have Bachelor\u2019s degrees in \nSiddha medicine (BSMS), one (Prem Nath) a Diploma in Siddha medicine (the older equivalent of the BSMS), one a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Ayurveda (Ruben-\ndran), and one a Bachelor\u2019s degree in homeopathy (Avalok). Two other practi-\ntioners have certificates issued by different Siddha associations, which do not count as legal documents allowing one to practice legally (Devanesan, Kapilan).  \n11  For a discussion of the ideal  type versus the empirical type, cp. Kuckartz 1991. It \nwould be revealing to test the ideal type that was developed on the basis of the seven cases in a next step using a larger sample in order to refine or confirm it.  98 | Nina Rageth \none should bear in mind that the conclusions are provisional and more re-\nsearch is needed to strengthen the arguments and make them more nuanced. \n  \n3  THE PROTAGONISTS: AN  EMANATION OF  \nTHE FIELD  \n \nI conceptualize the figure of the hereditary practitioner not as my interlocu-\ntors\u2019 individual creation or ad hoc  improvisation, but as a figure that emerges \nin a distinct social configuration. This view is expressed in Bourdieu and \nWacquant\u2019s famous statement: \u201cAnd we could say, following the formula of a famous German physicist, that the individual, like the electron, is an Aus-\ngeburt des Feldes : he or she is in a sense an emanation of the field.\u201d (1992: \n107, emphasis in the original) On this note, I suggest that the articulations of \nmy interlocutors follow certain rules which are linked to the dynamics of \ntheir social field (Bourdieu/Wacquant 1992: 98). Furthermore, I understand the figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner as a collective figure, the col-lective dimension resting on the construction of a sense of a larger commu-nity of hereditary practitioners, both synchronically and diachronically. This sense of community is established and reproduced by my interlocutors \nthrough the articulation of tradition. The synchronic community is expressed \nin the individual practitioner\u2019s identification with other, contemporary prac-\ntitioners. The diachronic community is expressed in the linking of the indi-vidual practitioners with previous practitioners and in their self-locating in a lineage of hereditary practitioners. The crucial point is that the articulation of community allows multiple subjects to identify with the figure of the he-\nreditary Siddha practitioner, a collective figure that transcends the interests \nand identity of the individual. This stance brings to the fore a pressing ques-tion: Which social configurations are constitutive for the emergence of the figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner? What are the characteristics of the field from which this figure emanates? \nThe field in which my interlocutors are situated underwent far-reaching \ntransformations in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries that are still reflected in its current arrangement. Those transformations are too complex to meaningfully outline in a short synopsis. In the following, I will limit my attention to one distinct component of those transformations, namely the pro-cess of the formal professionalization of the medical profession. Broadly Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 99 \n \n speaking, professionalization means turning an occupation into a profes-\nsion12, a process observable in many different occupational domains, medi-\ncine being just one among them, though it is often held out as \u201cthe canonical example\u201d of professionalization (Ranganathan 2013: 903). Needless to say, \nthe professionalization of Siddha medicine is a complex process that can only \nbe sketched out in broad strokes here.\n13 The process can be traced back to the \nlate colonial period, and it continued into India\u2019s independence. The colonial administration and later the Indian government both took on a leading role in this process, yet it should be realized that associations of what were then called ISMs (Indian Systems of Medicine) and individual practitioners of \nISM were also decisive actors (cp. S\u00e9bastia 2012b; Sujatha/Abraham 2009, \nwho strongly emphasise this point). I will limit the following remarks to one \nscholarly position arguing that it is no historical coincidence that the profes-sionalization of Indian medical systems coincided with the emergence of re-sistance to British colonialism.\n14 This position is reflected in Last\u2019s statement \nthat the professionalization of Indian medical systems was carried out \u201cto \nrival those [medical institutions; NR] set up for \u2018cosmopolitan\u2019 (or \u2018West-\nern\u2019) medicine by the imperial regime\u201d (Last 1996: 385).15 The development \nof professionalized Indian medical systems, be it Siddha medicine or others, reflects, so to speak, a dominated society\u2019s strategy to \u201cestablish parity with the hegemon\u201d (Habib/Raina 2005: 69). Indian medical systems emerged a s \nstandardized, professionalized forms of medicine in a period in which India \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n12  Broman lists six criteria for a pr ofession: \u201c(1) specialized and advanced educa-\ntion, (2) a code of conduct or ethics, (3) competency tests leading to licensing, (4) \nhigh social prestige in comparison to manual labor, (5) monopolization of the \nmarket in services, and (6) considerable autonomy in conduct of professional af-fairs\u201d (1995: 835).  \n13  I am not referring here to what Engler (2003: 450), with regard to Ayurveda, calls \u201crudimentary professionalization\u201d at its very inception, but to professionalization which is closely linked to the dev elopment of a modern college institution.  \n14  There is a rich literature on the connections between nationalism, the construction of identities, and medicine; see, for example, Brass 1972, Hausman 1996, Lang-ford 2002, Leslie 1976, Weiss 2009, Wujastyk/Smith  2008.  \n15  Another interpretation prioritizes the role of practitioners and students of IMS who wanted to improve their reputations and economic opportunities and thus \naspired to adapt I MS to the dominant biomedicine.  100 | Nina Ra geth \nwas engaged in what Weiss calls a \u201cstruggle to counter cultural imperialism\u201d \n(2005: 175) and was forming a \u201cnational-cultural imaginary\u201d (Langford 2002: 17) of the emerging nation state. Through the process of professional-ization, Indian medicine was reified as a series of distinct medical systems, \nmaking it possible for them to challenge Western claims of superiority in \ngeneral and to oppose the particular Western medical knowledge system to which the colonial state subscribed (Sujatha/Abraham 2009: 37).\n16 While \nAyurveda featured most prominently as the Indian counterpart to Western medicine and has received the greatest attention in both emic and academic debates, other Indian medical systems also emerged and were presented as \nsuperior alternatives to Western medicine.\n17 These dynamics found expres-\nsion in the \u201cstate-sponsored medical pluralism\u201d (Sujatha/Abraham 2009: 35), \nwhich, at least normatively, recognizes and advocates non-biomedical sys-tems and integrates them into the public health sector. The positive evalua-tion of Indian medical systems has continued and is visible in India\u2019s present medical landscape in the form of the Ministry of AYUSH (an acronym for \nAyurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy), which \npromotes medical pluralism and is tasked with the role of protecting AYUSH medical systems.\n18 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n16  The term \u201cSiddha medicine\u201d appears f or the first time in a government report of \n1923, the so- called Usman Report. Before that, it was known as Tamil Medicine \nor Tamil Ayurveda (S\u00e9bastia 2012a: 166). Krishnamurthy (1984) also shows that \nSiddha and Ayurveda have only been treated as two distin ct medical systems rel-\natively recently.  \n17  On Ayurveda, cp. Langford 2002; on Siddha medicine, cp. Weiss 2009; for na-turopathy in India, cp. Jansen 2016.  \n18  The Ministry of AYUSH dates back to the establishment of the Department of \nIndian Systems of Medic ine (ISM) in 1969, to which homeopathy  was added in \n1995, when it became the Department of Indian Systems of Medicine & Home-opathy (ISM&H). It was renamed the AYUSH Department in 2003, and in 2009 \nTibetan medicine was included. In 2014 it was given the sta tus of an independent \nministry.  However, in spite of the promotion of medical pluralism, AYUSH med-\nicines still receive only marginal support. This leads Priya to speak of \u201cundemo-\ncratic pluralism\u201d (2012:  104) and Naraindas, Quack and Sax (2014) of \u201casymmet-\nrical conversations\u201d between different medical systems. For the issue of inequal-\nity in accessing these medical services, cp. Broom  et al.  2009.  Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 101 \n \n As Broman (1995: 835) points out, \u201cspecialized and advanced education\u201d \nis one of the key criteria for distinguishing professions from other occupa-\ntions. Professionalization involves a process of setting up a formalized and standardized education and training system. Retrospectively, the establish-\nment of the School of Indian Medicine in Chennai in 1924 can be described \nas the starting point of this process, since it was the first college to teach Indian medicine (Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha) independently of Western medicine (e.g. Arnold 2000: 185; Bala 2007: 103).\n19 The first college where \nSiddha medicine could be studied as a separate degree was only opened in 1964 in Palayamkottai, a town in Tamil Nadu (S\u00e9bastia 2012b: 4f).\n20 The \ncreation of what Broman calls \u201cspecialized and advanced education\u201d (1995: 835) also involved the definition of an orthodox body of knowledge. This meant sanctioning what is considered valid and excluding what is considered invalid knowledge, a process which obviously led to the alteration of the knowledge base of the respective occupation (Ranganathan 2013: 925).  \nIn the process of the professionalization of Siddha medicine, the teaching \nand transmission of medical knowledge was turned into a college course comprising a set canon of subjects and following a distinct curriculum and, as Sujatha points out, \u201cdistinct epistemic models of the body\u201d (Sujatha 2011: 191).\n21 Siddha medical training was restructured on the basis of a Western-\nstyle education and modelled along the lines of the biomedical curriculum, as is obvious from the length of the course, the distinction between under-\ngraduate and postgraduate training, the subjects taught,\n22 the setting of the \nteaching, and the way the students are examined.23 This restructuring has had \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n19  Previously, in 1822, a Native Medical Institution was opened in Calcutta, which \naimed at a hybridized form of the Western and Indian medical systems. It was \nclosed in 1835 (Fischer -Tin\u00e9 2013: 35).  \n20  Today there are seven Siddha medical colleges in Tamil Nadu and one college in Kerala offering a BSMS degree. Six of them are private and the other two gov-ernment ins titutions.  \n21  The curriculum of the 5.5 -year college program was designed by the CCIM (Cen-\ntral Council for Indian Medicine), cp. http://www.ccimindia.org/siddha -sylla-\nbus.php, July 10, 2016.  \n22  The BSMS includes subjects such as biochemistry, microbiology, anatomy and \nphysiology; cf http://www.ccimindia.org/siddha -syllabus.php, July 10, 2016.  \n23  Jansen  shares a similar observation with regard to naturopathy (2016:  15). 102 | Nina Ra geth \nan effect not only on the form and content of Siddha medicine as a medical \ndiscipline, but also on the practice of the prospective practitioners.24 I ob-\nserved during my fieldwork that Siddha physicians who studied exclusively in the college setting often exhibit striking similarities to biomedical doctors: \nthey wear white coats, are equipped with stethoscopes, and speak of metab-\nolism, hypertension, and sugar levels in generic biomedical language; also, they are addressed by patients as \u201cdoctor\u201d and hardly ever as vaittiyar  or \nmaruttuvar . Moreover, these practitioners often begin a consultation by \nchecking the patient\u2019s blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer, but hardly ever assess the imbalance of the three humors ( mukku \u1e5f\u1e5fam or trido \u1e63a) of \nwind ( v\u0101tam ), bile ( pittam ), and phlegm ( kapam ) by sensing the patient\u2019s \npulsation ( n\u0101\u1e6di paric \u014dta\u1e49ai or n\u0101\u1e6di p\u0101rttal ).\n25 Also, they send their patients to \ntake X-rays and blood tests in laboratories and prescribe drugs in the same manner as biomedical doctors. The drugs are colorful capsules and sealed tablets that look very much like biomedical drugs. Furthermore, the profes-sionalization of Siddha medicine involved the establishment of scientific so-\ncieties and associations that were founded as a means to create a platform for \nthe exchange of medical knowledge and to institutionalize the scientific ideal of transparency.\n26 \nThe Indian government played a decisive role in the creation of the new \nmedical institution, which leads Sujatha and Abraham to speak of a \u201cstate-induced institutional development\u201d (2009: 37). They write (2009: 40): \u201cThe \nestablishment of various councils, national institutes and drug testing labor-\natories were direct outcomes of the recommendations made by various com-mittees set up by the government.\u201d One of the major concerns of this \u201cstate-induced institutional development\u201d was the testing and validation of drugs in accordance with biomedical standards. New regulations concerning the pro-duction of drugs were introduced. One of these regulations requires that \ndrugs which are produced for sale on the pharmaceutical market have to be \npatented by the Office of Drugs Control and must receive a Good \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n24  Referring to these changes, Sujatha speaks of a process of \u201cpharmaceuticaliza-\ntion\u201d (201 1: 193).  \n25  On sensing the pulse, cp. Daniel 1984: 115; cp. Sieler 2014: 325 \u2013326. \n26  The establishment of scientific societies is a strong example of what Habib and \nRaina call the \u201croutinizing [of] a new set of institutional practices that were ele-ments of  the modern research systems\u201d ( 2005:  74). Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 103 \n \n Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certificate (S\u00e9bastia 2012a: 178\u2013179, 2015: \n951). In order to obtain this certificate, the composition of the drug has to comply with the Drugs and Cosmetics Act (1940) and Rules (1945), which, as Sujatha and Abraham rightly state, subjects \u201cthe ISMs [Indian Systems of \nMedicine] to the political economy of the laboratory\u201d (Sujatha/Abraham \n2009: 40\u201341 ) and restricts the agency of the practitioner in the production of \nthe medicine. The role of the government in the process of professionaliza-tion also becomes visible with regard to legal regulations concerning the re-quirements for the practitioners. One of these regulations is the Indian Med-icine Central Council Act, introduced in 1970, under which only physicians \nwith the required credentials have the authority to practice medicine (Pay-\nyappallimana/Hariramamurthi 2012: 284).\n27 With the introduction of this act, \nholding an officially recognized certificate became mandatory to practice \nSiddha medicine legally, which delegitimizes other forms of knowledge transmission (S\u00e9bastia 2012b: 5).\n28 Thus, professionalization introduced oc-\ncupational closure on the basis of a requirement for formal qualification and \ncreated a group of professionals who are entitled to practice Siddha medicine \nlegally and, vice versa , a group of practitioners who are excluded from the \nprofession because they do not have the documents authorizing them to prac-tice. These government regulations thus replaced other, informal mecha-nisms of occupational closure laid down by the gurukula institution, or, more \nbroadly speaking, the government regulations did not reinforce the authority \nof the gurukula  institution but undermined it. As will become clear in the \nfollowing reconstruction of my interlocutors\u2019 self-understanding, it is this \nprocess of the formal professionalization of Siddha medicine that is consti-tutive of the emanation of the figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner. \n  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n27  This act was preceded by several other registration acts, such as the Medical Reg-\nistration Acts introduced between 1912 and 1919 in all the provinces of India (Hardiman 2009: 275).  \n28  Since  1977, the required ce rtificate has been the Bachelor\u2019s degree in Siddha \nMedicine and Surgery (BSMS).  104 | Nina Ra geth \n4  THE FIGURE OF THE HE REDITARY  \nSIDDHA PRACTITIONER  \n \nUsing one of Bourdieu\u2019s phrases, the reconstruction of my interlocutors\u2019 nar-\nratives regarding their self-representation provided in the following section takes the form of \u201c\u2018an account of the accounts\u2019 produced by social subjects\u201d (Bourdieu 1989: 15). It emphasizes especially how my interlocutors con-struct symbolic boundaries, that is, conceptual distinctions which social ac-\ntors deploy to organize their social worlds (Lamont/Moln\u00e1r 2002: 168). In-\nvestigating symbolic boundaries sheds light, as Lamont and Moln\u00e1r remark, on \u201cthe dynamic dimensions of social relations, as groups compete in the production, diffusion, and institutionalization of alternative systems and principles of classifications\u201d (ibid: 168). It is this dimension of social rela-tions and the construction of classifications which is ultimately of interest \nhere. The analysis of the construction of symbolic boundaries is divided into \ntwo sections. The first part focuses on the \u201c constitutive outside \u201d (Hall 2003: \n17, emphasis in the original) in the accounts of my interlocutors. The argu-ment formulated here is based on the common assumption that \u201call identity is differential identity\u201d (Laclau 1995: 151) and that therefore the outside is constitutive of the identity concerned. The second part focuses on the appro-\npriation of symbolic resources in the process of self-fashioning, such as con-\nceptual distinctions or interpretive strategies. Special attention is given to the fusion of a religious and a scientific semantics in the self-fashioning of the hereditary Siddha practitioner and to the emphasis on tradition versus inno-vation.  \n \n4.1  The Constitutive Outside  \n \nMy interlocutors distinguish the hereditary Siddha practitioner from three figures and their respective forms of medicine: the biomedical doctor, the Ayurveda practitioner, and the college-trained Siddha practitioner. \n  Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 105 \n \n 4.1.1  The Biomedical Doctor as the Constitutive Outside  \n \nAll my interviewees, apart from Devanesan, refer to biomedical doctors and biomedicine.\n29 Their descriptions of biomedicine revolve around a small rep-\nertoire of topics on the basis of which they demonstrate Siddha medicine\u2019s alleged superiority over biomedicine. A dominant theme which runs through their accounts is the juxtaposition of biomedicine as a man-made invention and Siddha medicine as a \u201cdivine medicine\u201d (Prem Nath, 31.12.2014) with a \u201cdivine origin\u201d (Surendran, 16.1.2015). Regarding this matter, Prem Nath (31.12.2014) says: \u201cIt [Siddha medicine] is not invented by anybody else. \nNot [\u2018by\u2019] me, nor [\u2018by\u2019] my ancestors nor by anybody else.\u201d\n30 It has, he \nstates, a \u201cdivine source.\u201d My interlocutors describe biomedicine, by contrast, \nas a science developed by human scientists who gradually come up with new technology and new medical formulations that only have a provisional valid-ity and will eventually be overwritten by new inventions: \n \n\u201cThen the next thing, in allopathy they find out some combination.  Then, after ten \nyears, what they say is, \u2018this medicine is not good for this problem, so please avoid \nthis medicine.\u2019 But in Siddha medicine what was written three thousand years back, still I am doing that same medicine. And three thousand years from now, my successor \nwill still be doing this medicine. How miraculous it is!\u201d  (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015)\n31 \n \nAnother issue which comes up with regard to biomedical drugs is the nature \nof the drugs themselves. My interlocutors share the view that biomedical drugs are made of chemicals. Anbarasi states, for example: \u201cAll are chemi-cal. Not natural. It is a pity what is going on.\u201d (6.1.2015) Siddha medical drugs, on the other hand, are held to be composed of natural substances and \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n29  While my interlocutors speak of \u201callopathy,\u201d \u201cmodern medicine\u201d or \u201cEnglish \nmedicine,\u201d I will use the term \u201cbiomedicine,\u201d which is a common term in aca-demic literature.  \n30  Mr. Prem Nath practices Siddha medicine in his own clinic in Thiruvananthapu-\nram. He hails from a hereditary Siddha family with a lineage dating back in his-tory before the Common Era. He has a Diploma in Siddha medicine.  \n31  Mrs. Anbarasi practices Siddha medi cine in her own clinic in Coimbatore and \nruns a business selling drugs to retailers. She has studied in a gurukula  and has a \nBachelor\u2019s degree in Siddha Medicine and Surgery.  106 | Nina Ra geth \nthus to be in tune with nature. The trope of Siddha medicine\u2019s harmony with \nnature is prominent in all my interlocutors\u2019 accounts, and it is also visually present on their webpages, as well as in the leaflets and brochures they pro-vide through icons such as fresh leaves, flowers, roots, and images of manual \ntools for the production of drugs. Biomedicine appears in all the accounts \n(except in Devanesan\u2019s) as a counter-example to the naturalness of Siddha medicine. The chemical substances of biomedical drugs are considered \u201cpoi-son\u201d (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015) and are seen as the source of the side effects (pak-kavi\u1e37aivu) of these drugs.\n32 The characterization of biomedicine as a medi-\ncine with side effects is present in all my interlocutors\u2019 accounts (again not \nin Devanesan\u2019s). Kapilan states: \u201c[\u2026] the problem is the side effects caused \nby this treatment. One disease will disappear with the medicine, and another will arise in another part of the body because of the medicine.\u201d\n33 (12.1.2015) \nSiddha medical drugs, on the other hand, are described as drugs which do not have any adverse effects\u2014provided they are made in the right way\u2014be-cause, as stated above, they are believed to be made from natural substances, \nor, as my interlocutors also say, they are made in accordance with the \npa\u00f1cap\u016btam theory. This theory comprises the view that the micro- and macro -cosmos are both constituted of the five elements\u2014ear th, water, fire, \nair, and space\u2014and that accordingly everything that we take in should only comprise these pa\u00f1cap\u016btas. \n  \n\u201cSo we are using the herbs to prepare the medicine. With the help of pa\u00f1cap\u016btas only \nwe are treating the patient s. So the herbs have pa\u00f1cap \u016btas, our bodies have \npa\u00f1cap\u016btas. [\u2026] But allopathy medicines are not made by pa\u00f1cap\u016btas . Or were they \nmade by pa\u00f1cap \u016btas? No! Allopathy is made by a company. They mix up chemicals \nand make them i nto a medicine. That is all.\u201d (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015)  \n \nWith regard to biomedical drugs, my interlocutors raise another aspect, namely the curing mechanisms. All my interlocutors (except Devanesan) \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n32  This claim can be taken as a reversal of the accusations with which their \u201cgui ld\u201d \nis often confronted today: accusations of quackery and of causing harm to people.  \n33  Mr. Kapilan practices Siddha medicine in his own clinic in Pollachi. He has stud-\nied in a gurukula and has a certificate in Siddha medicine issued by a Siddha \nassociati on.

But we are not giving any treatment to the symptoms. We only focus on \nthe root cause. So when the root cause will be gone, automatically the p roblem will \nsubside.\u201d (Rubendran, 6.1.2015)34 \n \n4.1.2  The Ayurveda Practitioner as the Constitutive Outside \n \nAyurveda practitioners and Ayurveda medicine appear in all my interlocu-\ntors\u2019 narratives, yet only on the periphery. This is a surprising finding, since, \nduring the Tamil revivalist movements of the twentieth century, Ayurveda \nfigured as the quintessential \u201cother\u201d of Siddha medicine (cp. Weiss 2008, 2009). On the basis of this observation, and with Richard Weiss in mind, I am inclined to translate this finding as an expression of a shift in boundary-making. \nIt is noticeable that, when my interlocutors refer to Ayurveda, they do \nnot emphasize the differences between Siddha medicine and Ayurveda in the first place but rather accentuate their similarities. My interlocutors stress that the two medical systems are both Indian, that they share diagnostic proce-dures (Rubendran), medical formulas (Rubendran, Anbarasi, Surendran) and concepts about the constitution of the body (Devanesan, Surendran), and that \nthey mainly differ in terms of language (Tamil for Siddha medicine and San-\nskrit for Ayurveda). However, and this should not be overlooked, at the same time they subordinate Ayurveda to Siddha medicine. Some of my interlocu-tors (Surendran, Avalok, Rubendran) d o this by arguing that Siddha is the \nolder and original medicine and that Ayurveda is just a translation of Siddha medicine into Sanskrit. Most often, however, Ayurveda is subordinated to \nSiddha on the basis of the substances used for the medical drugs. Four of my \ninterlocutors describe the use of metals and minerals as one of the quintes-sential and unique characteristics of Siddha medicine, while they describe \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n34  Mr. Rubendran practices Siddha medicine in his own clinic in Coimbatore. He \nhails from a hereditary Siddha family with a lineage going back fifteen genera-\ntions. He has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Ayurveda Medicine and Surgery.  108 | Nina Ra geth \nAyurveda as herbal-based medicine, which they consider less effective and \nnot fit for treating chronic and severe diseases. \n \n\u201cAnd this is another important thing: Siddhars did not only prepare medicine with \nherbs, but also metals and minerals and salts, byproducts from the sea, shells, all kinds \nof shells [\u2026]. So our Materia Medica is not only herbs, but also metals -medicine, \nminerals -medicine. If we look at the books, it is alchemy work. In the whole world \nuntil now, nobody did that, nobody else can do it. \u201d (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015)  \n \nOn the basis of the same argument, Prem Nath describes Ayurveda as \u201chu-\nman medicine\u201d ( ma\u1e49u \u1e63avaittiyam)  and Siddha medicine as \u201cdivine medi-\ncine\u201d ( t\u0113vavaittiyam) . He classifies Ayurveda as ma\u1e49u \u1e63avaittiyam  because it \nis herbal-based medicine that does not require higher knowledge for the pro-\nduction of drugs. Conversely, he argues that Siddha medical drugs can only be produced by applying the \u201cdivine method\u201d\n35 for the purification of metals \nand minerals, that is, the method that was discovered by the siddhars, which \nmakes Siddha medicine t \u0113vavaittiyam . \n \n4.1.3  The College -Trained Siddha Practitioner as the \nConstitutive Outside  \n \nThe figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner is primarily framed against \nthe figure of the college-trained Siddha practitioner. The latter is, so to speak, \nthe main \u201cconstitutive outside\u201d of the hereditary Siddha practitioner in my interlocutors\u2019 accounts. In my interlocutors\u2019 view, college-trained practition-ers are Siddha practitioners who studied exclusively in a modern college set-ting. Prem Nath describes them as \u201cuniversity people\u201d or \u201cacademic people\u201d who follow the \u201cuniversity model.\u201d Alternatively, they are depicted as prac-\nticing the \u201cmodern\u201d (Devanesan, 5.2.2015) or the \u201cregular\u201d (Anbarasi, \n6.1.2015; Surendran, 16.1.2015) Siddha medicine. The college-trained Sid-dha practitioner is constructed as the negative other of the hereditary practi-tioner with reference to a number of issues, all of which can be interpreted as expressions of my interlocutors\u2019 perceived struggle to have their knowledge approved and of the question of what constitutes genuine Siddha \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n35  http://www.siddhavaidyam .com/Principles_of_SiddhaMedicine.html, August  18, \n2017.  Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 109 \n \n medical knowledge. Furthermore, my interlocutors share the view that the \nestablishment of the college institution has not contributed to the preserva-tion of the medical tradition but, on the contrary, poses a danger to its con-tinuation. Kapilan encapsulates this view by stating that the college- trained \npractitioners are \u201ctweaking the original concept\u201d of Siddha medicine and that \u201ctherefore there is a danger that people who are bookish are destroying the real practical tradition of Siddha\u201d (12.1.2015). This leads him to speak of the \u201cfalse institutionalization of Siddha medicine,\u201d which amounts to the \u201csys-tematic destruction of Indian traditional culture.\u201d \nMy interlocutors share the view that one cannot learn the real Siddha \nmedical knowledge in colleges because colleges are not in possession of it. Prem Nath says that colleges do not have access to the \u201ckey books,\u201d that is, to the knowledge revealed by the god \u015aiva, because this knowledge is kept \nwithin the families of hereditary Siddha practitioners. The \u201cproper knowledge\u201d can therefore not be acquired in college. On Prem Nath\u2019s webpage it says:  \n \n\u201cToday there are recognized Siddha Medical Colleges [which] run under the govern-\nment universities where Siddha medicine is taught. But they are running the course \nwith average syllabus [compared] to the knowledge of Traditional Vaidyas. In Siddha Vaidyam [\u2026] many toxic drugs and heavy metals are [used] for manufacture [of] \nbhasmas and chindooras. [Lack] of proper purification will cause major draw -backs \nin health. Traditional Siddha Physicians are doing effective purification process. But they hide it as traditional secret and transfer [it] only to the next generatio n.\u201d\n36 \n \nAs this quote shows, my interlocutors are mainly concerned about \nknowledge that pertains to the production of Siddha drugs that involves the purification of the substances, that is, the transformation of metals and min-\nerals into medicine. In their view, this purification process is the unmistaka-\nble characteristic of Siddha medicine and an essential element of Siddha practice. Rubendran states that he learnt the production of medicine from his father, which is the only way to master that practice. And Surendran too states that in college you can only learn how to become a Siddha physician, \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n36  http://www.siddhavaidyam.com/siddhavaidyam.html , August  18, 2017.  110 | Nina Ra geth \nyou cannot learn how to produce medicine, because, he states, \u201c[f]or that we \nneed a guru.\u201d37 \nMy interlocutors do not just speak of the omission of certain elements of \nSiddha knowledge, but also of the remaking of Siddha knowledge through \nthe merging of traditional Siddha knowledge with biomedical knowledge. With regard to this remaking, Prem Nath mentions the mixing of modern anatomy, physiology, and pathology books such as Chaurasia\u2019s Anatomy  or \nHutchinson\u2019s Clinical Methods  with the classical Siddha literature. Two of \nmy interlocutors (Devanesan, Avalok) also mention the introduction of bio-medical diagnostic techniques into Siddha practice, such as measuring blood \npressure, taking blood tests, and doing X-rays, instead of assessing the im-\nbalance of the three humors ( mukku\u1e5f\u1e5f a or trido\u1e63 a) through the n\u0101\u1e6di p\u0101rttal \n(examination of the n \u0101\u1e6di). \n \n\u201cThe vaittiyar s who lived here, they healed people in this way.

I am only telling you the way how I prefer it. \u201d (Devanesan, \n5.2.2015)38 \n \nFurthermore, Devanesan points to the change in how the medicine is dis-pensed. He says that the \u201cmodern practitioner\u201d prescribes manufactured medicines which come in capsules, tablets and syrups, and he adds: \n \n\u201cHow can you trust that modern medicine? I cannot trust that modern medicine. They \nare putting preservatives. Preservatives are damaging the liver! So why would we do it like that? This Siddha medicine is meant to be taken naturally. This is how the divine \ngave it.\u201d (Devanesan, 5.2.2015)  \n \nWith regard to changes to Siddha medical knowledge through the establish-\nment of a college education, Prem Nath (31.12.2014) speaks of the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n37  In this respect, some of my interlocutors mention the omission of formulas for the \nproduction of key drugs in Siddha medicine such as mupp \u016b or navap \u0101\u1e63\u0101\u1e47am , \nwhich are thought to cure all diseases and even to bestow immortality.  \n38  Mr. Devanesan practices Siddha medicine in his own clinic in Pondicherry.

They describe the college as a place that only provides theoretical knowledge and that does not acknowledge the centrality of practical and experiential knowledge to Siddha medicine. They share the view that n\u0101\u1e6di p\u0101rttal for diagnosing diseases and \nthe methods of producing drugs cannot be learnt theoretically but only prac-\ntically by gaining experience from experienced persons. Prem Nath speaks \nin this regard of \u201c a\u1e49upavam citta vaittiyam cikiccai ,\u201d which he translates as \n\u201cSiddha medicine as the treatment of the experience\u201d (31.12.2014). The the-oretical knowledge of the schoolbook is not sufficient to become a Siddha practitioner. Kapilan refers to college-trained practitioners as \u201cbookish peo-ple\u201d and states that \u201cthere is a danger that people who are bookish are de-\nstroying the real practical tradition of Siddha\u201d (12.1.2015). They pose a dan-\nger to the Siddha system because they \u201ccannot prepare Siddha medicine\u201d (Kapilan, 12.1.2015), which, however, as mentioned above, is a defining characteristic of Siddha practice. In my interlocutors\u2019 view, the Siddha med-ical texts do not contain straightforward instructions for how to practice Sid-dha medicine but are written in an encoded manner that is generally known \nas parip \u0101\u1e63ai (obscure language). Rubendran says: \u201cThe books are full of se-\ncrets, and the experience-people, they find out these secrets. Each and every \n\u015b\u0101stra, every poem, every note has some secrets.\u201d (6.1.2015) It is only through practice that the physician can discover the meaning of the texts and learn how to practice the medicine properly.

Apprenticeship and not studying is \nthus the appropriate mode of learning. \nThe last dominant theme in the framing of the college-trained practitioner \nthat I want to mention revolves around the duration of the study period. Four \nof my interlocutors point out that the study of Siddha medicine is a long- term \ncommitment, or, as Prem Nath puts it, a \u201clifetime enrolment\u201d (31.12.2014). \nA Bachelor\u2019s degree in Siddha Medicine and Surgery, by contrast, is com-pleted within only five and a half years, a timeframe within which, in my interlocutors\u2019 view, Siddha medicine cannot be mastered: \n \n\u201cDefinitely it is not enough. It is not enough! How can you learn all those things in \nfive and a half years? In that time we can just lear n the basic things, that\u2019s it.\u201d (Ruben-\ndran, 6.1.2015)  \n \n\u201cLet\u2019s take a \u015bi\u1e63yan [student; NR]. You know \u015bi\u1e63yan? He must learn at least twelve \nyears under the supervision of a guru. Then on ly he is eligible for practice.\u201d  (Suren-\ndran, 16.1.2015)40 \n \n4.2  The Self -Fashioning of the Hereditary  \nSiddha Practitioner  \n \nAll my interlocutors present themselves as protecting and disseminating Sid-\ndha medicine, which is congruent with their view that Siddha medicine is on the verge of disappearing and that, in order to preserve it, the medicine needs to be spread, both locally and globally. Though my interlocutors agree on the Tamil character of the medicine\u2014according to the common narrative, \u015aiva \ngave the medical knowledge to the siddhars in the Tamil language\u2014they also \nagree that Siddha medicine is not supposed to remain within the Tamil com-\nmunity but is destined to be a global commodity. My interlocutors\u2019 efforts to preserve Siddha medicine, or, as Kapilan says, \u201cto rekindle the Siddha prac-tice and Siddha way of life\u201d (12.1.2015),  is sometimes directed against bio-\nmedicine, but mainly against Siddha medicine as taught and learnt in Siddha medical colleges. This becomes evident, as I show below, in how they \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n40  Mr. Surendran practices Siddha medicine in his own clinic in Coimbatore and \nruns a business selling drugs to retailers. He has studied in a gurukula  and has a \nBachelor\u2019s degree  in Siddha Medicine and Surgery.  Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 113 \n \n fashion themselves as hereditary practitioners in opposition to the college-\ntrained practitioners and in the specific way they frame the traditional Siddha medicine. Among my interlocutors, Prem Nath challenges the college ver-sion of Siddha medicine in the most explicit way, as becomes visible in the \nfigure of the rebel that he enacts:\n41 \n \n\u201cSometimes university people have a lot of trouble with me. They are thinking I am a \nrebel. No, I am not a rebel, but yes I  am, this is my blood, this is my tradition, I cannot \ndisobey my ancestors\u2019 comments [\u2026].\u201d (Prem Nath, 31.12.2014)  \n \nThe other interlocutors also fashion themselves as hereditary practitioners in \nopposition to college-educated Siddha practitioners, a position that finds ex-pression in the criticism they articulate against them, yet they apply a less insurgent rhetoric than Prem Nath. My interlocutors employ four main themes in their fashioning of the figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner and their framing of traditional Siddha medicine. On the basis of those four \nthemes, they differentiate more or less explicitly the hereditary Siddha prac-\ntitioner from the college-trained practitioner who serves them as a primary source of legitimacy. These four themes share a distinct religious semantics and a strong emphasis on tradition. They are: type of knowledge (man-made versus divine), access to knowledge (college versus gurukula), the purpose \nof the medicine (physical versus religious), and the motivation for the prac-\ntice (money versus karma). \n \n4.2.1  Type of Knowledge  \n \nMy interlocutors differentiate between divine knowledge and man- made \nknowledge, portraying traditional Siddha medical knowledge as belonging \nto the former and the college version of Siddha medicine as well as biomed-\nicine to the latter. As mentioned above, my interlocutors classify Siddha medicine as divine medicine, t\u0113vavaittiyam , because of the medicine\u2019s prov-\nenance: Siddha medicine is not seen as an invention but as a divine discovery, \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n41  Prem  Nath enacts the role of the rebel not only in the interview he gave me, but \nalso in interviews on local TV channels. See, for instance, his interview on Surya \nTV (Devavidya, 2015).  114 | Nina Ra geth \nthat is, as a discovery of the siddhars, the \u201cgodly people\u201d (Anbarasi). On \nPrem Nath\u2019s webpage we read: \n \n\u201cPalm Leaf Manuscripts says [ sic] that the Siddha System of medicine was first taught \nby Lord Shiva to his wife Goddess Parvathy. Goddess Parvathy in turn passed  on all \nthese knowledge to her son Lord Muruga. Lord Muruga then taught Siddha Medicine \nto his favorite disciple Sage Agasthya. It was from Agasthya and his disciples, the 18 Siddhars, the great wisdom of Siddha spread to what it is today. \u201d\n42 \n \nThe divine nature of Siddha medical knowledge is expressed in different \nways, the most dominant being its characterization as absolute knowledge. \nAvalok, for example, speaks of Siddha medicine as a complete body of knowledge that the siddhars have obtained and transmitted, and Anbarasi says in a similar vein: \n \n\u201cEverything is there. You cannot go anywhere from here. Everything is written. Eve-\nrything is finished. Everything is over. There is no need to find new things. Everything \nis written. You just have to take and do a nd give. It will be effective. \u201d (Anbarasi, \n6.1.2015)  \n \nPrem Nath also speaks of the completeness of Siddha medicine, his point \nbeing that it is flawless and unerring knowledge. In this connection, he com-\nplains that, if a treatment is unsuccessful, college-trained practitioners blame \nthe medicine for the failure. However, as he also says: \u201cThere is no mistake happening in the science, only in the scientist.\u201d (31.12.2014) \nThe absolute character of the medicine is also expressed on the basis of \nits timelessness . As I have already mentioned, Siddha medicine is contrasted \nwith biomedicine on the basis that Siddha medicine will never correct itself. \nSurendran states: \n \n\u201cThe medicines present today will disappear in five years. But our medicines, no one \nwill ever cha nge them. Even one million years after. It was their [the Siddhars\u2019] intu-\nition, by meditation [\u2018they obtained it\u2019]. \u201d (Surendran, 16.1.2015)  \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n42  http://www.devavidya.com/siddhavaidyam.html , June  29, 2016.  Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 115 \n \n Furthermore, as I mentioned before, Prem Nath argues that humans are not \nsupposed to change anything in the Siddha knowledge, since any alteration of divine knowledge is a corruption of the absolute knowledge, an argument he uses to challenge the college version of Siddha medicine: \u201cIf I invent \nsomething, it is a fake statement.\u201d (31.12.2014) He says that he has \u201cno right\u201d \nto customize the knowledge because he is not the creator of the knowledge, but only a medium who transfers this knowledge on to others: \u201cI am an agent. The masters are above me, beyond my control.\u201d\n43 Prem Nath thus demands \nproper respect for it: \u201c[\u2026] when a god gives you a chance to know these things, don\u2019t neglect, don\u2019t challenge the god; you have to obey the orders of \ndivine source.\u201d Anbarasi and Surendran too stress that it is crucial that they \nexactly follow \u201cwhatever is written in the literature\u201d (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015) in order to produce good medicine. \n \n4.2.2  Access to Knowledge  \n \nMy interlocutors claim to have access to the complete Siddha knowledge be-\ncause they have studied in a gurukula with hereditary Siddha physicians, who \nare believed to hold the real knowledge, unlike the colleges. The \u201ckey books,\u201d as Prem Nath notes, are in the hands of hereditary practitioners, and the knowledge they contain is only transmitted through hereditary lineages: \u201cblood is thicker than water,\u201d he says proverbially to indicate that Siddha \nknowledge is not shared with outsiders but remains within the family \n(31.12.2014). The importance of the sense of belonging to a lineage of he-reditary Siddha practitioners is also reflected in Prem Nath\u2019s self-presenta-tion on his webpage: \n \n\u201cPrem Nath hails from a traditional Siddha family dating back to pre -british [ sic] era \nin India. His family migrated to Kerala from Pandi Kingdom of Tamil Nadu on the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n43  Prem Nath is reflexive about innovative elements in his own practices, such as \nrunning  a website, providing consultancy through skype, appearing on TV, or of-\nfering an online Siddha training program. He applies the analogy of \u201cold wine in \na new bottle\u201d to point out that the form of knowledge transmission can be altered if this is beneficial for the quest to preserve divine knowledge, though the knowledge itself ought not to be changed.  116 | Nina Ra geth \nrequest of the king Cheraman Perumal to provide Varmam training44 to his military \nas well as to serve as Siddha physicians in the court.

And Rubendran points out decisively that he belongs to a lineage of hereditary practitioners. He opens his account by saying that he belongs to the fifteenth generation of practitioners in his family. The element of lineage \nis also strongly present on his webpage. The \u201cAbout Us\u201d section on the \nwebpage starts with the following sentences: \n \n\u201cThe founder of Agasthiyar Siddha Ayurveda Hospital was the Great Legend Late Dr. \nSri Brahmananda Swamigal. He was born [\u2026] as the 4th son of Sivadha Ach ary, a \nwell-known traditional siddha physician and Ammaluammal. He got interested in \nmedicine at the age of 8 yrs. So he started his Gurukulam period under his respectful master Sri Velayuthampillai from Thiruvettar in Kanyakumari District. \u201d\n47 \n \nThe webpage also informs the reader that Dr. Sri Brahmananda Swamigal, \nwho is Rubendran\u2019s father, also \u201cgathered much knowledge of traditional Siddha medicine from his father\u201d and that he had two other gurus. Rubendran \nstresses that he has studied Siddha medicine since childhood under the guid-\nance of his father and thus learnt how to produce drugs, which is impossible in the college setting: \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n44  \u201cVarma training\u201d refers to varmakkalai , the art of the vital spots, a technique \nwhich constitutes a sub -branch of Siddha medicine; cp.

Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 117 \n \n \u201cNobody in any university or any college can teach these medicine preparation or \npurification, because they don\u2019t know. They don\u2019 t know. The teachers, they don\u2019t \nknow how to prepare. That is what I told you. Many of the poems, they have a secret. Those secrets are never taught in the colleges, never taught in the universities, that is, \nonly hereditary people, they only know. \u201d (Ruben dran, 6.1.2015)  \n \nThis quote shows that from my interlocutor\u2019s point of view access to \nknowledge depends not only on physical access to the manuscripts, but also on access to their meaning, which requires someone with the expertise to decode the encrypted information contained in the Siddha poems. \n \n4.2.3  Purpose of the Medicine  \n A further recurring theme is the purpose of the medicine. Four of my inter-locutors express the view that Siddha medicine\u2019s ultimate objective is not to cure a physical sickness, but to serve as a means to unify with god, that is, to \nattain liberation, a view which is not \u201ctheir own,\u201d but which is present in the \nclassical Siddha literature.\n48 They share the view that the siddhars have \npassed on a medical system which guarantees longevity.49 Kapilan even \nspeaks of \u201cdeathlessness\u201d (12.1.2015).  Longevity in turn allows for more \ntime to complete the process of spiritual perfection, which will ultimately lead, as Devanesan says, to \u201ca connection between the soul and the divine\u201d \n(5.2.2015),  by which he means liberation ( j\u012bva\u1e49mukti ). The theme of libera-\ntion is most distinctly discussed by Anbarasi, who makes the strong point \nthat wellbeing is a precondition for liberation. Siddha medicine, according to Anbarasi, is a means to purify the body and the mind, which is needed for doing good things in society and is, in turn, a step towards one\u2019s merging with god. In her view what might appear to be a preventive and rejuvenating \nmedicine serves a religious purpose. She says:  \n \n\u201cSo those who are strong in physical, they will reach god, they will do service to the \npeople with their healthy body, so they will reach god. This is the main aim of our \nSiddhars. \u201d (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015)  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n48  Cp., for instance, Zvelebil 1973: 29.  \n49  They are  referring to k\u0101yaka \u1e3bpa, a major subfield of Siddha medicine which \nteaches technique s for the prolongation of life.  118 | Nina Ra geth \nAnd elsewhere she states: \n \n\u201cIf our body is healthy only, we can do, with the help of this body only we can do \nservice to the society [\u2026]. We will become part of god in future. That is the main \nthing of the Siddhars. \u201d (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015)  \n \n4.2.4  Motivation for the Practice  \n The fourth dominant theme in the fashioning of traditional Siddha medicine that I wish to highlight revolves around the question of the motivation for \ncarrying out this medical practice. All my interlocutors express the view that \na main characteristic of the hereditary Siddha practitioner is that he or she is not driven by entrepreneurial motives but rather practices Siddha medicine out of a sense of duty. They all present themselves as working for the preser-vation of Siddha medicine, which they describe as their duty towards human-ity and their tradition. Devanesan, for example, speaks of it being his duty to \nprotect Siddha medicine from disappearing, and Avalok states that he makes \ngreat efforts to share his knowledge with other traditional physicians in order to preserve it. Prem Nath too describes his Siddha medical activities as a duty, an idea he connects with the supposedly divine nature of the medicine. He states that Siddha medicine was \u201cdeveloped for human beings\u201d and that he therefore wants to turn the secretly kept knowledge into \u201ca public prop-\nerty\u201d and make it accessible to the people (31.12.2014). He states that this is \na duty which was given to him by god: \n \n\u201cWithout the grace of god and master, we cannot do it [practice the medicine]; if god \nopens a gateway to the system, we have to enter it, realize it,  not for you, but for your \npeople.\u201d (Prem Nath, 31.12.2014)  \n \nAnbarasi equates duty with karma: \u201cDefinitely, it is a duty, it is karma\u201d \n(6.1.2015),  and she goes on to say that she does her Siddha medical work out \nof a sense of karma, without any financial motivation. Four of my interlocu-tors express the view that executing a (divine) duty should not be a means of making money. Prem Nath, for example, states that there \u201ccannot be a busi-\nness motivation; money is wrong motivation,\u201d and elsewhere he says that \n\u201chealing is not [\u2026] for money. It has a divine, a divine source, a divine vi-\nsion\u201d ((31.12.2014). And finally, my interlocutors contrast their non-Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 119 \n \n entrepreneurial motivations with the motivations of the college-trained Sid-\ndha practitioners, which they unanimously describe as being financial in na-ture. Devanesan says, for example: \u201cThe modern way is, it is a commercial way, you know, [it is] business\u201d (5.2.2015). In my interlocutors\u2019 view, the \nquintessential materialization of the commercialization of Siddha medicine \nis the pharmaceutical companies that are competing for money. Anbarasi states:  \n \n\u201cAnother big company is INCOPS, a government company in Chennai. But the \nINCOPS medicine, they are making them for commercial purpose. They are supplying \nall primary hea lth centers all over Tamil Nadu. [\u2026] But they are going commercial. \nMyself, we are not commercial; our medicine should act well [\u2026], so we are concen-\ntrating on the quality of the medicine. \u201d (Anbarasi, 6.1.2015)  \n \nWhile my interlocutors describe the college-trained practitioner and pharma-\nceutical companies as prioritizing economic profit over quality, they fashion \nthemselves as giving the utmost importance to quality and as having no in-\nterest in financial profit. \n  \n5  SEMANTIC POSITIONING  IN A STRATEGIC \nACTION FIELD  \n \n5.1  Positioned Semantics  \n \nThe finding of the similarities and overlaps in my interlocutors\u2019 accounts could be interpreted in different ways, such as mere coincidence, the result of the particular interview situation, or the reproduction of a dominant dis-cursive strand. The finding could also be viewed as an expression of the shared structural constraints within which the accounts are constructed, \nwhich indeed is the interpretation I suggest applying. I will argue for this \ninterpretation on the basis of Bourdieu\u2019s proposition that \n \n\u201c[\u2026]  social space is so constructed that agents who occupy similar or neighboring \npositions are placed in similar conditions and subjected to similar conditionings, and \ntherefore have every chance of having similar dispositions and interests, and thus of \nproducing practices that are themselves similar.\u201d (Bourdieu 1989: 17)  120 | Nina Ra geth \nAccordingly, I adopt the position that my interlocutors internalize their struc-\ntural conditions and enact them in their practices, thus producing simila r se-\nmantic patterns which become apparent in their accounts. This Bour-dieuesque stance that the individual is socially constituted does not imply \nthat the individual does not \u201cpossess the necessary properties\u201d to structure \nthe field him- or herself (Bourdieu/Wacquant 1992: 107). According to Bourdieu, the individual is both socially structured by the field and also ac-tively structures the field.\n50 I go with this proposition in so far as I do not \nconsider my interlocutors as mere \u201cepiphenomena of structures\u201d (Honneth et al. 1986: 41), nor regard their semantic construction of the figure of the he-\nreditary Siddha practitioner as an act of tacit reproduction of what the objec-\ntive structures allow to be articulated. Rather, I suggest that my interlocutors recognize and reproduce symbols of authority in their self-fashioning while also consciously reconfiguring them, at least partially, that is, within the structuring framework of their social position. I understand their self-fash-ioning in this sense as \u201cregulated improvisations\u201d (Bourdieu 1990: 59), a \nterm which interweaves the embodiment of objective structures with human \nagency. \nWhat are these symbols of authority, and how are they reconfigured in \nmy interlocutors\u2019 accounts? The most dominant symbol of authority is sci-\nence and biomedicine. As I have already mentioned, the professionalization of Siddha medicine meant the adaptation of the Siddha medical tradition to \nthe biomedical paradigm and the introduction of the secular, scientific ra-\ntionale as the yardstick of its validity. Clearly, my interlocutors recognize the biomedical paradigm. The majority of them frame Siddha medicine as a sci-ence; they speak of the efficacy of their drugs, provide catalogues with treat-ments and medication to their patients, and use a biomedical vocabulary to describe diseases. However, they also interweave a religious semantics with \nthe scientific semantics and in doing so reconfigure the notion of science. In \ntheir accounts Siddha medicine is not just a science, it is a divine science, a science, moreover, with absolute validity and completeness, a science that has not been invented by mortal scientists but was discovered by the siddhars. \nAnd what are the structural conditions to which the fashioning of the fig-\nure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner is subjected? As has hopefully \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n50  Kaldewey  (2015:  104) uses the term \u201cco -construction\u201d to  describe the relationship \nbetween the subject\u2019s habitus and the social field.  Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 121 \n \n become clear in the preceding sections, I argue that the semantic figure of \nthe hereditary Siddha practitioner emerged as a reaction to the professional-ization of Siddha medicine. The specific fashioning of this figure can be read as an expression of their perceived struggle to preserve and disseminate their \nknowledge and practice with the authority of which it has been deprived in \nthe process of the professionalization of Siddha medicine. As I stated above, the professionalization of Siddha medicine induced, at least normatively, a standardization of the medical system. This led to the creation of a more ho-mogenized version of Siddha medicine and to the delegitimization of certain forms of knowledge and practice. I argue that it is my interlocutors\u2019 experi-\nence of the marginalization of their knowledge which leads them to formu-\nlate narratives that confront the dominant version of Siddha medicine. Thus, their accounts can be read as alternative narratives that on the one hand rec-ognize the scientific paradigm, yet on the other hand interweave a religious semantics with the scientific semantics, producing counterhegemonic ac-counts as a result. \nSo why, one might ask, do religious semantics and tradition figure so \nprominently in these counterhegemonic accounts? Generally speaking, inter-pretative social scientists are wary of asking for explanations because they carry an air of positivism and determinism at worst and provide a reductionist analysis at best (Charmaz 2006: 126). Nevertheless, I will point to one pos-sible explanation for the distinct delineation of the hereditary Siddha practi-\ntioner in my interlocutors\u2019 accounts. I suggest that the rhetoric of religion \nand tradition is particularly effective as a symbolic resource because the col-lege version of Siddha medicine prioritizes a scientific over a religious logic and uses a secular, scientific rationale as the yardstick for its validity, or to put it more generally, because the professionalization of Siddha medicine entailed a secularization of the Siddha system. The government\u2019s recognition \nof Siddha medicine as an Indian medicine and its integration into the \nAYUSH ministry alongside other medical systems\u2014and not, for exampl e, \ninto the Ministry of Culture\u2014happened alongside its \u201cscientification.\u201d By emphasizing religious elements in the depiction of the \u201creal\u201d Siddha medi-cine, my interlocutors accentuate exactly those elements that are absent from their constitutive outside. Furthermore, the college version of Siddha medi-\ncine is not guarded by a religious authority but by a secularized medical pro-\nfession. The representatives of the college version of Siddha medicine do not appear as religious experts, but rather as medical experts who are close to the 122 | Nina Ra geth \nbiomedical profession and not to any religious group or community. Hence, \nthe representatives of the college version of Siddha medicine are not inter-ested in participating in a religious discourse and therefore do not pose a challenge to my interlocutors\u2019 religious strategy: the medical authority will \nnot question my interlocutors\u2019 religious semantics or confront it with an al-\nternative religious interpretation, which makes it a powerful strategy. Finally, reference to religion, whether by emphasizing its divine provenance, stress-ing the sacredness of the knowledge or introducing concepts such as j\u012bva\u1e49mukti , grants my interlocutors a degree of stability and independence \nwhich they would not acquire if they were trying to authorize their \nknowledge by obtaining the backing of other medical entities such as the \nWHO or medical research institutes. Reference to religion is unproblematic and is favored because religion appears as an independent entity. This is par-ticularly true of the Hindu religion, which is the source of my interlocutors\u2019 claims to legitimacy: there is no higher or centralized religious authority in the Hindu religion which could challenge my interlocutors\u2019 narratives, and \nthe religious figures they draw on are the gurus, the siddhars and \u015a iva, who, \nhowever, are both absent and invisible.\n51 \n \n5.2  Competition for Power  \n \nShmuel Eisenstadt states concisely that processes of institutionalization en-\ntail \u201cthe creation and definition of norms to regulate the major units of social behavior and organization,\u201d as well as the \u201ccriteria according to which the flow of resources is regulated between such units, and sanctions to ensure that such norms are upheld\u201d (1964: 235f). It is hardly surprising that the cre-ation, definition, and sanctioning of norms involves struggles over power be-\ncause these practices set standards which marginalize and exclude certain \nactors. The present section deals with these power struggles. \nWhat is meant by power and power struggles? A social field in the Bour-\ndieusque relational view is a \u201c field of struggle\u201d  (Bourdieu/Wacquant 1992: \n101, emphasis in the original) in which the actors strive to maintain or im-prove their relative positions. The relationship between different positions is \nstructured on the basis of the distribution of the power that is valid within a \nparticular social field (ibid: 97). Possessing power encompasses the authority \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n51  For a  discussion of the role of the guru in Hinduism, cp. Mlecko 1982.  Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 123 \n \n to grant or refuse access to resources and to decide about the inclusion of \npeople in and their exclusion from \u201cthe game\u201d. Bourdieu speaks here of \u201csymbolic power\u201d (1989: 22), that is, the \u201cpower of \u2018world-making\u2019\u201d (ibid: 22). It is this struggle for symbolic power that is at stake in the accounts of \nmy interlocutors, the struggle over the power to formulate criteria of legiti-\nmacy, competence, and validity. Bourdieu equates power metaphorically with capital, a concept that he extends from material to intangible resources. He argues that the unequal distribution of capital structures the arrangement in the field and that the possession of power coincides with the possession of capital (Bourdieu/Wacquant 1992: 97). Bourdieu identifies four key types of \ncapital, the four \u201cfundamental powers\u201d (1989: 17) of economic, cultural, so-\ncial, and symbolic capital, which are relationally linked to the concepts of field and habitus in his theoretical framework. Capital is field-specific, mean-ing that the different types of capital become effective in different fields. \u201cFields designate arenas,\u201d as Swartz paraphrases Bourdieu\u2019s stance, \u201cwhere specific forms of capital are produced, invested, exchanged, and accumu-\nlated\u201d (1996: 78). I want to argue that it is the production, investment, ex-\nchange, and accumulation of cultural capital that is at stake in the present case of the Siddha medical field.\n52 In his numerous writings, Bourdieu uses \nthe concept of cultural capital in different ways, giving it a polysemic char-acter. Yet, broadly speaking, it can be described as a concept that pinpoints cultural resources as the basis for social inclusion and a means to improve \none\u2019s social position. Swartz (1996: 75\u201376) states: \u201cHis point is to suggest \nthat culture in the broadest sense of the term) can become a power resource.\u201d According to Bourdieu, cultural capital appears in three different types. It exists in an incorporated form, that is, in the form of embodied knowledge, of cultivated dispositions, or the habitus which a person has acquired (Bour-dieu 1992: 55). Secondly, it exists in an objectified form, that is, in the form \nof material goods which make cultural capital materially transmittable \n(Bourdieu 1992: 59). Finally, it exists in an institutionalized form, that is, in \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n52  In the eyes of Bourdieu, application of the term \u201ccultural capital\u201d might appear \ninappropriate  here because he uses the term to denote signals which stem from \nthe dominant culture. However, I am using the term to denote not that their cul-tural capital reflects the \u201c r\u00e9pertoire  of high status cultural signals\u201d (Lamont and \nLareau 1988:161, emphasis in the o riginal), but that they have competence in the \nrepertoire of \u201cmarginal high status signals\u201d (ibid:  157).  124 | Nina Ra geth \neducational credentials which sanction the incorporated capital (Bourdieu \n1992: 61). Thus, cultural capital, unlike economic capital, does not follow an economic rationale and does not generate an economic profit in the first in-stance, but a symbolic value. The symbolic value is typically expressed in \nofficial nominations such as titles, recognized qualifications, and certifica-\ntions which generate prestige, honor, or recognition (Bourdieu 1989: 21).  \nIf we analyze the accounts of my interlocutors under these conditions, we \nsee that Siddha medicine appears as cultural capital in their accounts, yet that \nthey create an alternative version of cultural capital to the dominant form. In my interlocutors\u2019 discursive reality, the embodiment of knowledge generates \nprestige, honor, or recognition, yet it is not the accumulation of college \nknowledge but the accumulation of hereditary, traditional Siddha knowledge. The latter knowledge finds expression in an objectified form, in material ob-jects which are not college books but old manuscripts. And the hereditary Siddha medicine appears as institutionalized cultural capital, not in the form of college diplomas attesting to college training, but in the form of member-\nship of a gurukula which sanctions their claim to possess the \u201creal\u201d Siddha \nknowledge. The elements which act in my interlocutors\u2019 accounts as cultural \ncapital correspond to those elements which are excluded from the college version of Siddha medicine. My interlocutors\u2019 alternative cultural capital is knowledge which is not tied to a modern educational institution, but to tradi-tionally authoritative persons and lineages. My interlocutors refuse to \nacknowledge the capital of the college institution and construct instead the hereditary knowledge that is not certified by a BSMS as an alternative capi-tal. This alternative capital serves them as a resource for the power with which they strive to improve their position in the field. \n \n5.3  Strategic Semantics  \n \nI suggest conceptualizing the semantic construction of the figure of the he-reditary Siddha practitioner as the expression of a strategy in a social field. Bourdieu\u2019s term \u201cstrategy\u201d is far from being a voluntaristic and subjective pursuit of unrestricted freedom in a deliberate improvisation. Swartz (1996: \n76) states concisely: \u201cBourdieu\u2019s actors pursue strategies but not as con-\nscious maximizers of limited means to achieve desired ends.\u201d A strategy is Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 125 \n \n tied to the game in which it is played out and connotes \u201ca feel for the game\u201d \n(Lamaison/Bourdieu 1986: 111).53 \nExamining my interlocutors\u2019 accounts, I suggest that they pursue a strat-\negy of heresy and that they speak from the semantic position of the chal-\nlenger. Moreover, I suggest that they position themselves in opposition to the \ncollege-educated practitioner, who figures as the incumbent in the social field. The analytical distinction between the challenger and the incumbent has been introduced by Fligstein and McAdam (2012) in their analysis of the workings of strategic action fields, which is their own conceptual develop-ment of Bourdieu\u2019s concept of field.\n54 They argue that strategic action fields \nare sites of constant rearrangements: \u201cIn short, we expect strategic action fields to always be in some sort of flux, as the process of contention is ongo-ing and the threats to an order always present to some degree. \u201d \n(Fligstein/McAdam 2012: 13) Responsible for this flux are the two figure s \nof the challenger and incumbent, which (together with the governance units) compose a strategic action field.\n55 Incumbents are the actors \u201cwho wield dis-\nproportionate influence within a field and whose interests and views tend to be heavily reflected in the dominant organization of the strategic action field\u201d (ibid: 13). It is the incumbents\u2019 interests which structure the field. Challeng-ers, on the other hand, occupy a less influential position within the field. Ac-cording to Fligstein and McAdam, challengers \u201crecognize the nature of the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n53  With this stance, Bourdieu distinguishes his own concepts from rational action \ntheory and stresses that actors\u2019 choices are tacit and dispositional and are deter-\nmined by their socialization and the opportunities and constraints provided by the \nfield in which they act.  \n54  Fligstein and McAdam define a strategic action field as a \u201cconstructed mesolevel \nsocial order in which actors (who can be individual  or collective) are attuned to \nand interact with one another on the basis of shared (which is not to say consen-sual) understandings about the purposes of the field, relationships to others in the field (including who has power and why), and the rules gover ning legitimate ac-\ntion in the field\u201d (2012: 9).  \n55  The analytical distinction between incumbent and challenger can be traced back to Bourdieu\u2019s  differentiation between conservation strategy and strategy of heresy \n(1993: 73). According to Bourdieu, conserva tion strategies are followed by the \northodox, those who aim at the consolidation of the social order, whereas strate-gies of heresy are pursued by the heterodox, those whose aim is its subversion.  126 | Nina Ra geth \nfield and the dominant logic of incumbent actors,\u201d but formulate an alterna-\ntive version of the social field and their position within it (ibid: 13).  \nI argue that the circumstances generated by the professionalization of \nSiddha medicine lead my interlocutors to articulate an alternative version of \nthe social order to secure for themselves a position in the social field. In this \nalternative version, they disparage the knowledge of the college-trained prac-titioner as corrupted, whereas they assess their own knowledge as being of divine provenance and hence flawless. They claim that they learnt the \u201creal\u201d Siddha medicine from practitioners who stand in a lineage of hereditary Sid-dha physicians who trace their origin ultimately back to the siddhars. Clearly, \nmy interlocutors\u2019 semantic strategy does not aim at consolidating the social \norder. On the contrary, they try to reframe the social order in a way that is profitable to them. In this sense, I argue that their self-fashioning as heredi-tary Siddha practitioners and their devaluation of the latter\u2019s knowledge is to be interpreted as attempts to attain a different status in the social field. Their claim to belong to a lineage of hereditary Siddha physicians and the distinct \nstylization of traditional Siddha knowledge serve them as weapons with \nwhich to counter the dominant position in the field and the dominant narra-tive. My interlocutors need a \u201cweapon\u201d in order to maintain and bring into the present their understanding of Siddha medicine, in which lineage is an integral part. Only if the element of lineage is accepted as a relevant feature of the medical tradition can my interlocutors survive and thrive. \n  \n6  CONCLUSION  \n \nFrom my interlocutors\u2019 point of view, the recognition of the Siddha medical \nsystem by the Indian government and its integration into the public health \nsector does not favor the medicine\u2019s preservation, nor does it have an em-powering effect on Siddha practitioners. On the contrary, they argue that it has corrupted the divine medicine. Furthermore, they argue that recent de-velopments have undermined their authority and restricted them in their agency, subjecting them to a multitude of regulations. This is a common as-\nsessment made by my interlocutors, who fashion themselves as hereditary \nSiddha practitioners. However, from an analytical perspective it can be ar-gued that it was precisely the formal professionalization of Siddha medicine that created the conditions under which the semantic figure of the hereditary Self-fashioning of the Hereditary Siddha Practitioner | 127 \n \n Siddha practitioner could emerge. The conditions created by the profession-\nalization of Siddha medicine allow Siddha practitioners like my interlocutors to position themselves in relation to college-trained practitioners and to fash-ion their self-image in opposition to them. The figure of the hereditary prac-\ntitioner thus appears as a counterpoint to the college-trained practitioner. \nThough the hereditary practitioner opposes the college-educated practitioner, they stand in a symbiotic relationship. It is only in this opposition that the religious semantics becomes effective and the figure of the hereditary Siddha practitioner becomes meaningful. Though the heterodox strategy of the chal-lenger and the orthodox strategy of the incumbent are two distinct strategies, \nthey need to be seen as mutually constitutive: \u201cOrthodoxies,\u201d as Swartz puts \nit (1996: 80), \u201ccall into existence their heterodox reversals by the logic of distinction that operates in cultural fields.\u201d Obviously, this argument does not aim to make the dread expressed by my interlocutors less real or less valid. However, it does deconstruct their accounts as discursive strategies and reminds us of their historical contingency. The argument stresses that the \nsemantic construction of the hereditary Siddha practitioner aims at reconsti-\ntuting the epistemic hierarchies. Accordingly, I propose that the hereditary Siddha practitioner be conceptualized as following a strategy of heresy or the strategy of a challenger, both of which aim to improve the challenger\u2019s social position in the field. Moreover, I suggest their narratives, which give space to religion and emphasize tradition, should be read as a mode of cultural pro-\nduction through which they attempt to attain a different status in the social \nfield. The adoption of a religious semantics and the emphasis on tradition become effective in this strategy because my interlocutors position them-selves in opposition to an \u201cother\u201d who lacks those very qualities. \n \n \nBIBLIOGRAPHY  \n \nArnold, David (2000): The New Cambridge History of India: Science, Tech-\nnology and Medicine in Colonial India, Cambridge: Cambridge Univer-sity Press. \nBala, Poonam (2007): Medicine and Medical Policies in India: Social and \nHistorical Perspectives, Lanham: Lexington Books. \nBernard, Russell H (2011): Research Methods in Anthropology: Qualitative \nand Quantitative Approaches. 5\nth edn., Lanham: AltaMira Press. 128 | Nina Ra geth \nBourdieu, Pierre (1989): \u201cSocial Space and Symbolic Power\u201d, in: Sociolog-\nical Theory (7/1), pp. 14\u201325. doi:10.2307/202060. \nBourdieu, Pierre (1990): The Logic of Practice, Stanford: Stanford Univer-\nsity Press. \nBourdieu, Pierre (1992): Die verborgenen Mechanismen der Macht (=Schrif-\nten zu Politik & Kultur, Volume 1), Hamburg: VSA-Verlag. \nBourdieu, Pierre (1993): Sozialer Sinn: Kritik der theoretischen Vernunft, \nFrankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp. \nBourdieu, Pierre/Wacquant, Lo\u00efc J.D.

Looking at the historical development of Ayurveda in Germany and its \ntreatment by different academic disciplines, the article addresses the positions of \nAyurveda practitioners in relation to religion and medicine, showing how this affects them and the potential fo r religious embodiment in the interactions and relationship \nbetween practitioner and patient. In this regard , the doctrine of the Doshas in Ayur-\nveda plays a crucial role in its representation as the epitome of holistic healing. It will \nbe shown that the no tion of religious embodiment and the positions of the practitioners \nare constantly involved in processes of negotiation correlated with flexibility of posi-\ntioning within the discursive field constituted by Ayurveda, religion, and medicine.\n1 \n \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1  This article is a translated and adapted version of \u201cAyurveda als Aushandlungsort \nreligi\u00f6ser Verk\u00f6rperung?

(2015) Somatisierung des Religi\u00f6sen : \nEmpirische Studien zum rezenten religi\u00f6sen Heilungs - und Therapiemarkt.  134 | Antony George Pattathu  \n1  INTRODUCTION  \n \nIn Germany, Ayurveda is one of the fastest growing healing practices in the \nfield of complementary and alternative medicine or CAM.2 Based on the In-\ndian cultural context and its historical development, Ayurveda is often linked \nto spirituality or religion in the study of religious approaches and debates (cp. Koch 2005a; Knoblauch 2009; L\u00fcddeckens 2018). In particular, Ayurveda\u2019s connection with New-Age influences and questions regarding the authentic-ity of its practice have been discussed ( cp. Otten 1996; Reddy 2000; Zim-\nmermann 1992; Zysk 2001). Accordingly, studies have been published in the disciplines of religious studies, anthropology, sociology and medicine ad-dressing the discursive field constituted by Ayurveda, religion, and medicine (cp. Chopra 2008; Engler 2003; Langford 2002; Warrier 2008, 2011). \nThe increase in alternative healing practices\n3 has to be understood as a \nreaction to transformations and reforms in health-care systems (Frank 2004: \n32; L\u00fcddeckens 2012: 288). The historical dissemination of the doctrine of \nthe separation of mind and body (Cartesian dualism) within biomedicine4 has \ncreated a need for alternatives on the market. CAM therapies, with their ho-listic conceptions, fill this gap and are becoming increasingly attractive (Kai-ser 2001: 16). With this development as a backdrop, we can observe the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n2  The World Health Organization (WHO) defines CAM as follows: \u201cThe terms \n\u2018complementary medicine\u2019 or \u2018alternative medicine\u2019 are used interchangeably \nwith traditional medicine in some countries. They refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country\u2019s own tradition and are not inte-\ngrated into the dominant health care system. \u201d This is consistent with Cant and \nSharma, for whom  CAM can also be understood as  \u201cforms of healing that depend \non knowledge bases distinct from that of biomedi cine and which, as such, do not \nshare the special legitimation that the state has conferred upon biomedicine \u201d \n(1999:  5). The term itself is one of the problem s that CAM s face.  \n3  Cp. L\u00fcddeckens in this volume.   \n4  Here the word \u201cbiomedicine\u201d refers to the dominant form of medicine that is dis-\npersed globally and that in Germany is designated as Schulmedizin. This term is \nused in medical anthropology to refer to  biological and pathophysiological per-\nspectives on the human body and to emphasize the normative an d technological \nimplications that are inscribed into biomedicine\u2019s  history and development. For \nan overview of this discussion , cp. Lock  and Nguyen 2010.  Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment  | 135 \n \n boundaries between religion and medicine shift. Territories that formerly fell \nmainly within the scope of medicine have increasingly been addressed by religion and vice versa (cp. L\u00fcddeckens 2012). These shifting boundaries are influenced by the historical development of both categories in the context of \n\u201cscientific authority, capitalist commodification of medicine, and colonial-\nism and postcolonialism\u201d (Klassen 2017: 403). This also affects the self-un-derstanding of practitioners in both fields, and there is an increasing boom in religious therapeutics (Fields 2001: 2; Kaiser 2001; Koch 2005a: 24). \nAyurveda is entangled exactly within this field of shifting boundaries be-\ntween religion and medicine, as it caters to the need for an alternative to the \nbiomedical system that goes beyond the separation of mind and body. This \nentanglement is inscribed into the holistic healing approach of Ayurveda that is rooted in the doctrine of the Doshas.\n5 This doctrine has the potential for \nreligious embodiment within Ayurveda and locates it in the discursive field constituted by Ayurveda, religion, and medicine.\n6  \nHere religious embodiment is understood as a process that is negotiated \nbetween the practitioner, the patient, and their surroundings. In this process the body becomes the medium between the inner and outer worlds and oscil-lates between processes of subjective perception and objectification (cp. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n5  Discussion of the meaning of the Doshas forms  a discourse in its own right within \nAyurveda , with different positions and philological interpretations (Heckmann \n2003: 35; Mittwede 1998 : 89\u201391). In relation to the ethnographic research de-\nscribed in section  2 below,  I will provide an explanation of the Do shas based on \na German Ayurveda textbook that is lin ked to practitioners in this  field. According \nto this textbook the Doshas can be understood as forms of energ y that constitute \nand guide the body\u2019s physical and psychological processes. In their materiality \nthe different Doshas of Vata, Pitta and Kapha are  based on the elements of earth, \nwater, fire, air and ether. They can be found in different parts of the body in dif-\nferent concentrations and are characterized by different qualities (e.g. Vata has \nthe quality of movement). Depending on whether the Doshas are in balance or \nnot, they can cause different illnesses or can cure. They can be affected by  medi-\ncines, nutrition and behavior  (Heckmann 2003 : 35\u201340).  \n6  This discursive field, which is addressed in this study with r egard  to the possibil-\nities for religi ous embodiment in the healing practices of Ayurveda , is conceptu-\nally based on an approach to discourse influenced by Michael Bergunder (2008: 491, 2011: 19), Stuart Hall (2011), and Judith Butler (1997, 1999).   136 | Antony George Pattathu  \nCsordas 1990; Sch\u00fcler 2015; Klinkhammer/Tolksdorf 2015). The experi-\nences of patients and practitioners, the aesthetic setting, their preconceived imaginations, and their knowledge of Ayurveda are the prerequisites for this process.\n7 \nGenealogically the article will trace positionalities in the field in the light \nof historical developments. This will be done to decipher the ways in which Ayurveda is constructed, articulated, and performed by the actors in the field, rather than looking at the origins of Ayurveda to determine whether it is re-ligion or medicine. According to Butler (1999: xxix), \u201cgenealogy investi-gates the political stakes in designating as an origin and cause those identity \ncategories that are in fact the effects of institutions, practices, discourses with \nmultiple and diffuse points of origin. The task of this inquiry is to center on\u2014and decenter \u2014such defining institutions.\u201d Which attributes and characteris-\ntics are ascribed to Ayurveda by different authorities in the field? What does this mean for practitioners who position themselves in relation to religion and medicine, and how does this enable or prevent religious embodiment \nwithin Ayurveda? \nWith regard to different authorities or actors in the field, connections be-\ntween academic statements on Ayurveda and the emic perspective must be \nexamined because they determine the positions of the practitioners. The \nquestion of religious embodiment in Ayurveda is connected to the self-un-derstandings of its practitioners,\n8 who convey their own understandings of \nAyurveda to their patients and enable or restrict practices that can be per-ceived as a form of religious embodiment. Given the specific historical con-text of Ayurveda in Germany, certain academic positions on whether Ayur-veda is religion or medicine, taken together with the perspectives of its prac-titioners, will reveal interferences between Ayurveda and religious \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n7  The conceptual framework of this article a nd the material available only allow a \nfew examples to be provided of a form of religious embodiment in Ayurveda \nrooted in different conceptions of Ayurveda by different practitioners, the emic \nperspective of its patients and the actors in this discursive field.  \n8  The terminology practitioner is specifically chosen to grasp the wide spectrum \nand diversity of Ayurveda practitioners. Compared to terminologies like therapist \nor healer the whole range of practitioners from medical doctors to nutritionists can be integrated and the terminology also integrates the possibility of multiple \nqualifications, as the following paragraphs will show.  Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment  | 137 \n \n embodiment. This will help us map a first layer of the relevant discursive \nnetworks and structures in both the academic and the emic perspective in relation to Ayurveda and religion in Germany.  \nThe different conceptualizations of Ayurveda by practitioners, academ-\nics, journalists, and other authorities in the field, who constitute a discourse community, can be understood as a discursive network held together through communication, language, practices, and the institutionalization of Ayur-veda, religion, and medicine in Germany. These articulations and conceptu-alizations of Ayurveda as a form of \u201cidentity marker\u201d in the sense of Michael Bergunder and Stuart Hall\n9 take place in different discursive fields (media, \nscience, law, politics, etc.). The different fields constantly overlap, and dif-ferent authorities can be active within different fields. As part of these net-works and its field of discourse, Ayurveda can be also understood either as spiritual or religious, or as a form of spirituality negotiated by agents in the field.\n10 In this context, the discursive elements that condition the potential for \nreligious embodiment within Ayurveda will be addressed. \nOn the basis of fieldwork conducted in 2009, the aim of this article is to \nmap the discursive field constituted by Ayurveda, religion, and medicine, and to illustrate the circumstances that make religious embodiment possible for the patient. The practitioners\u2019 point of view will be helpful in understand-ing how positionings between religion and medicine take place in the Ger-man health-care market and how these positionings are influenced by aca-\ndemic discourses. In the following especially, the initial consultation and the \ninteraction and relationship between practitioner and patient will provide ac-cess points for the discussion.   \n2  ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARC H  \n \nThe point of departure for this article is ethnographic research consisting of three months of fieldwork carried out between December 2008 and February 2009 and based on the anthropological method of participant observation and \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n9  Identity in this sense is always contested and negotiated (Bergunder 2008 : 492) \n10  As will be shown , the focus on this discursive field is very much influenced by \nexisting academic studies and media representations (Bergunder 2011 : 44\u201345).  138 | Antony George Pattathu  \nsemi -narrative interviews with Ayurveda practitioners inspired by grounded \ntheory.11 The study was also based on an analysis of media representations \nof these practitioners and their institutions in the form of advertising bro-\nchures, webpages, newspaper articles, and both academic and non-academic \npublications by the interviewees. As part of the study, different Ayurvedic \nfacilities in southern Germany have been visited, among them private clinics and hospitals, health centers, and the practices of Heilpraktiker  (alternative \npractitioners). The study explicitly tried to capture the broad range of Ayur-veda practitioners, which other studies often reduce to a specific status group, such as medical doctors (MDs).\n12 \nThe duration of the participant observation varied from three to four days \nto half a day. The interviews were conducted in this period, as well as a num-ber of informal conversations and interviews with staff and patients. Nine practitioners in particular form the core of the study, among them two Heilpraktiker , two Bachelors of Ayurvedic Medicines and Surgery \n(BAMS),\n13 and five medical doctors. Two of the MDs were female and three \nmale, all the other practitioners being male. The aim of the ethnographic re-search was to describe the different forms of Ayurveda practices and to iden-tify the positioning of Ayurveda practitioners within the German healthcare system. Questions regarding career development, therapeutic measures, and motivation formed part of the interviews. Already here the question of the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n11  The ethnography is the result of cooperation with Prof. Harish Naraindas from \nJNU in Delhi and would not have been possible without  his support. I would also \nlike to thank Prof. Gabriele Alex, who made this cooperation possible. The inter-\nviews conducted for  this research were held in English , many of which contain \nlinguistic errors that have been retained  in the quoted passages to provide an au-\nthentic impression of the interview situation. The names of the interview partners have been changed to protect their identit ies. \n12  For example, Robert Frank only takes medical doctors into account in his work : \nsee his \u201c Globalisierung alternativ er Medizin : Hom\u00f6opathie und Ayurveda in In-\ndien und Deutschland \u201d (Frank 2004: 200).  \n13  The title \u201cBAMS \u201d is given to students within the Ayurveda college system in \nIndia, being based on a study program lasting  five to six years  which is increas-\ningly integrated with and adapt ed to the biomedical curriculum  (Langford 2002 : \n130; Welch 2008 : 129 ). Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment  | 139 \n \n relationship of their particular Ayurveda practices to religious influences and \nmedicine formed part of the interview schedule. \nIt should be mentioned that the focus on religious embodiment in this \narticle requires a long-term and thorough study of practitioner-patient inter-\nactions and consultations. Lacking this, the article can only provide initial \ninsights into the potential for religious embodiment based on an analysis of the discursive field and the perspectives and practices of some Ayurveda practitioners. \n  \n3  THE HISTORICAL DEVEL OPMENT OF AYURVEDA \nIN GERMANY  \n \nThe historical development of Ayurveda in Germany already gives the first \nindications of the relationship of Ayurveda to religion. As in Suzanne New-combe\u2019s description of the development of Ayurveda in England, only media representations and initial processes of institutionalization can be found in the evidence for the historical development of Ayurveda in Germany (2008: 257). The following descriptions of this development must be understood as \na sketch that can only give a rough idea of its course. At the beginning stands \nthe founding of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Ayurveda in Osnabr\u00fc ck in \n1983 as the first association of Ayurveda practitioners in Germany. The first Maharishi Ayurveda health center was also founded in Osnabruck (Frank 2004: 198).\n14 \nAlready in 1980 Maharishi Mahesh Yogi15 was invited to a conference \nin Delhi, where he announced the worldwide dissemination of Ayurveda and \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n14  Examples of other associations that have been founded since then and acquired \nan influence over the development of an Ayurveda practitioner \u2019s network in Ger-\nmany are the European Professional Association of Ayurveda -Practitioners and \nTherapists (VEAT) and the German Doctors Association for Ayurveda Medicine  \n(Deutsche \u00c4rztegesellschaft f\u00fcr Ayurveda -Medizin, D\u00c4GAM).  \n15  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (1911 \u20132008) was an Indian phys ics graduate who stud-\nied at the Sankaracarya Jyotir Math with Brahmananda Saraswati (1869 \u20131953) \nand was introduced to the teachings of the Advaita Vedanta. He was  the founder \nof the technique of transcendental meditation and came to fame as the guru of \ncertain celebrities such as the Beatles and Mia Farrow (Knott 2006 : 634).  140 | Antony George Pattathu  \nthe revitalization of the Vedic sciences (Jeannotat 2008: 300). The founding \nof the Deutsche Gesellschaft f \u00fcr Ayurveda , which is connected to the Ger-\nman Academy of Ayurveda, has to be understood in context of the Maharishi movement, even though this connection has become weaker, especially since \nthe Maharishi\u2019s death.  \nThe Association is registered as such and claims to be an independent \nand autonomous association of experts in which Ayurvedic medicine is not \nbound to any particular school.\n16 The explicit reference to Maharishi Ayur-\nveda as a seal of quality supported by the All India Ayurvedic Congress can be found in a special section on its webpage, where the Association also cau-\ntions against facilities that lack standardized forms of quality management.\n17 \nHere we can observe how the exclusion of non-standardized Ayurveda prac-\ntitioners is used as a marketing strategy in media representations that at the same time lend credence to the Maharishi Ayurveda label. Not only is Ma-harishi Ayurveda a registered trademark (\u2122) that offers a whole range of products, the Maharishi Ayurveda system is itself a franchise that represents \none of its first tangible processes of institutionalization in Germany (Humes \n2008: 309\u2013310). Maharishi Ayurveda has played a similar role in the insti-tutional development of Ayurveda in England (Newcombe 2008: 257) and North America (Reddy 2000: 5). \nIn the 1980s and 1990s Maharishi Ayurveda represented the most com-\nplex networks within the German Ayurveda landscape. With own products, \nits private clinics and health centers played an important part in the popular-\nization of Ayurveda (Jeannotat 2008: 303). The movement also caused a lot of criticism because it combined Ayurveda with transcendental meditation (TM),\n18 as the following excerpt from the German news magazine Der Spie-\ngel shows:  \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n16  Cp. http://www.ayurveda.de/index.php/gesellschaft -die-nr-1-in-europa/historie , \nJuly 10, 2018.  \n17  Cp. http://www.ayurveda.de/index.php/gesellschaft -die-nr-1-in-europa/mahari-\nshi-ayurve da, July 10, 2018.  \n18  Kim Knott defines TM  as follows: \u201c [T]ranscendental meditation is a technique \nfor mental and physical well -being and rejuvenation which, for some committed \nmeditators, leads on to programmes for higher spiritual development (e.g. sidhi  \nyoga), alternative medicine (ayurveda), and Vedic astrology \u201d (2006 : 634\u2013 635).  Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment  | 141 \n \n \u201cAyurveda, the ancient Indian medical system, is a mega trend in the wellness sector. \nThe German market is dominated by disciples of his holiness the Indian guru Maha-\nrishi Mahesh Yogi. With costly treatments, his holiness markets his transcendental meditation and abstruse world salvation theories.\u201d (Sch wertfeger 2004, author\u2019s trans-\nlation)  \n \nThis short media representation points to the fact that this aspect of the de-\nvelopment of Ayurveda in Germany through the Maharishi Movement at-tracted criticism. \nThe ethnographic research for this article also revealed other strands in \nthe historical development of Ayurveda in Germany that ran in parallel to the institutionalized development of the Maharishi Movement. Individual prac-titioners who began their training in India in the 1980s and 1990s or earlier and who migrated from there to Germany to practice Ayurveda characterize these trends. This was the case for the two BAMS practitioners who feature \nin the ethnographic research. The public visibility of Ayurveda practitioners \nand institutions that are not part of the Maharishi Network has increased over the last years. One example of this is the European Academy of Ayurveda, which was founded by Kerstin and Mark Rosenberg in Birstein in 1993 and is led by both (Rosenberg 2012: 63). They offer a broad variety of training programs and have been able to initiate a program for Ayurveda consultants \n(Ayurveda Fachberater ) that is certified by the Saarland Chamber of Com-\nmerce and Industry (IHK). In addition, they offer a master\u2019s degree for med-\nical doctors and medically qualified employees in cooperation with Middle-sex University in the UK.\n19 \nThis article can merely point out some of the highlights of the historical \ndevelopment of Ayurveda in Germany. This development must be thor-\noughly researched to obtain a deeper understanding of the current situation, \nbut a comprehensive history of Ayurveda in Germany providing a genealogy that reveals the breaks and continuities in the historically dominant narratives remains a research aim. Hopefully, however, this brief genealogical sketch will give an idea of the dominant forces and processes of institutionalization in the field and of the insights into public perceptions of this development. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n19  Cp. https ://www.ayurveda -akademie.org/das- kompetenzzentrum -fuer- ayurveda -\nund- yoga/studieren -an-der-akademie/internationales -netzwerk/ , July 10, 2018.  142 | Antony George Pattathu  \nThe tendencies that are visible in the development of Ayurveda in Ger-\nmany have nevertheless been framed conceptually by Anne Koch in order to \nprovide a deeper understanding of the current situation. With reference to Michael Stausberg, Koch takes into account the reaction of science\n20 to the \nhistorical development, media representations, and different meanings of Ayurveda (2005a: 26). Taking this as a premise, she distinguishes three phases in the development of Ayurveda,  which she describes as (a) homo\ng-\nenization, (b) popularization and (c) diversification. \n(a) The fact that Ayurveda is perceived as a homogeneous object in her \ndescriptions is the result of the translations and receptions of different aca-\ndemic works and concepts of Ayurveda by different scholars. Through their \nown academic work, these scholars have played their own part in the canon-ization and standardization of Ayurveda, and it is this that Koch describes as homogenization. In this context the reform and modernization of the Indian Ayurveda landscape has played a role in its existence in Germany, but Ger-man discussions of the relationship of Ayurveda to religion and medicine \ncannot be deduced from the Indian context (Koch 2005a: 27). \n(b) The popularization of Ayurveda is characterized by a number of dif-\nferent factors. Here important roles have been played by institutionalization \nprocesses and new writings, as well as by individual practitioners who act as multipliers for the propagation of Ayurveda. Special attention in this phase is given to the history of the New Age Movement,\n21 which Koch mentions \nwith reference to the scholar of religious studies, Christoph Bochinger, espe-cially pointing out the mixture of secular and religious elements within the movement in relation to ecology and holism. This development and the mix-ture of New Age and Ayurveda will be given special attention in the next section. The popularization of Ayurveda can be related to the growth in med-ical pluralism within the German health-care market, which can be under-\nstood as a reaction to changes in the health-care system and the \u201creligious \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n20  In this contribution , the word \u201c science \u201d refers  to branches of science and the \nscholars who have dealt intensively with the practice and theory of Ayurveda, \nprimarily indologists, anthropologist s, sociologists, medical practitioners, and \npublic health and religious studies sch olars.  \n21  For the discussion about New Age and the different approaches of conceptualiza-\ntion within the Study of Religion , cp.

Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment  | 143 \n \n field.\u201d22 The rise in CAM therapies can be also attributed to these develop-\nments, as this emerging medical pluralism serves as a kind of catalyst for the \npopularization of Ayurveda in Germany. This also has the effect that some of the practitioners who feature in the ethnographic research have offered not \nonly Ayurveda but a broad variety of CAM therapies (Koch 2005a: 28\u201330). \n(c) This kind of combination of Ayurvedic practices with other therapies \nand the introduction of Ayurvedic principles into other areas for commercial \npurposes can be understood as part of what Koch describes as Ayurveda\u2019s diversification, which at the same time is closely linked to its popularization. Diversification is the third phase in the development of Ayurveda in Ger-\nmany for Koch, which she dates to the 1990s. A special characteristic of this \nperiod is Ayurveda\u2019s intensified institutionalization and the sort of marketing strategies that can be observed with the Maharishi Movement. Representa-tions of Ayurveda on the web and marketing strategies selling Ayurveda a s \nwellness or cosmetics are also characteristic of this stage. At this point it is the legal aspects of practicing Ayurveda and legitimizing it that come to the \nfore (Koch 2005a: 30). \nKoch\u2019s conceptual frame, taken together with the examples from the eth-\nnographic study, provides a first access point for a better understanding of \nthe historical development of Ayurveda in Germany, even though an ade-quate study is still missing. In this sense the three phases form a heuristic tool with which to describe processes that have taken place diachronically \nbut that also exist in parallel to the current situation of Ayurveda in Germany.  \nIn the following section, the discursive field constituted by Ayurveda, \nreligion, and medicine will be mapped by the statements of scholars from \nsociology, Indology, religious studies and medicine. The reaction of science in the field that Koch describes will be deciphered in detail to show how Ayurveda has become an \u201cidentity marker\u201d that is negotiated around religion \nand medicine. It will be also shown how these positionings enable the poten-\ntial for religious embodiment as an aspect of therapy. \n \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n22  Koch uses the terminology of the \u201creligious field\u201d with  referenc e to Pierre Bour-\ndieu (2006, 60 \u201361) \n 144 | Antony George Pattathu  \n4 THE DISCURSIVE FIELD  CONSTITUTED BY \nAYURVEDA, RELIGION, AND  \nMEDICINE IN GERMANY  \n \nTo map the discursive field constituted by Ayurveda, religion, and medicine \nin Germany, different positionings must be taken into account. In the previ-\nous section, Ayurveda\u2019s historical development in Germany was described \nin order to form a background for some of the positions in this discourse. Examining different academic positions within this field of discourse will demonstrate the normative impact, both implicit and direct, that these evalu-ations and conceptualizations have on the self-positionings of Ayurveda practitioners within the field. In some cases, practitioners\u2019 voices cannot be \nsufficiently taken into account unless they are actually spoken to. For exam-\nple, Anne Koch and Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens analyze media representations of Ayurveda ( cp. Koch 2005a; L\u00fcddeckens 2018), while Zysk provides a gen-\neral diagnostic of the situation of Ayurveda (cp. 2001).  \nIn this section I would like to contrast their observations with the results \nof my own ethnographic research, which addressed the level of the practi-\ntioners and practitioner-patient interactions in order to discuss the relation-\nship of Ayurveda to religion, medicine, and the potential for religious em-bodiment.\n23 Academic positions, media, practitioners, and patients are im-\nportant factors in mapping the field within which Ayurveda is characterized as medicine, as spiritual or religious, or as religion. In order to consider these positionings critically, I will examine a few arguments in the academic field \nto show how Ayurveda is often construed as the \u201cother\u201d of religion.\n24 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n23  This article is very much part of the discourse that is discussed here and it has a \nnormative effect in itself.  Contrary to other articles in the field the trajectory here \nis to integrate the opposing positio ns to capture the plurality of Ayurveda and \ndiscuss the possibilities of a religious embodiment instead of locating Ayurveda on the side of religion or medicine.  \n24  This can be illustrated by the following quote : \u201cHence, Ayurveda is able to cover \nimportant  life spheres in a spiritual or world -view like manner, which are not cov-\nered in Christianity \u201d (Koch 2005b : 253, author\u2019s translation ). By c ontrasting \nAyurveda directly with Christianity in this way without taking the multiplicity of non- religious position s on Ayurveda in to consideration , Ayurveda automatically \nbecomes the \u201cother \u201d of religion.  Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment  | 145 \n \n One of the schools of Ayurveda that is clearly characterized by strong \nreligious connotations is Maharishi Ayurveda, already mentioned in the pre-\nvious section. First and foremost, this characterization is due the connection with transcendental meditation that formed part of the world view of Maha-\nrishi Mahesh Yogi and that is still propagated by his followers. In his teach-\nings, Ayurveda is only one of the Vedic sciences that are being revitalized. Another is Gandharva Veda, a specific form of Vedic music that is used to accompany some of the treatments of Maharishi practitioners, as was ob-served in the ethnographic research. Listening to this music is said to enable a direct connection to transcendental consciousness.\n25 In this strand of Ayur-\nveda, these techniques form part of an even broader spectrum of the religious techniques of the Maharishi movement.\n26  \nThe movement is one of the examples used by the Indologist Kenneth \nGregory Zysk to describe Ayurveda in the West27 as \u201cNew Age Ayurveda\u201d. \nZysk uses this terminology to describe the current phase in the history of Indian medicine, which for him is characterized by the importation of Indian \nmedicine into the West. Criticism of biomedicine and Cartesian dualism \nfrom within the New Age Movement was correlated with the development of the \u201cHolistic Health Movement,\u201d\n28 the link that enables Zysk to talk about \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n25  \u201cGandharva music is the eternal melody of Nature which is ever -lively in Tran-\nscendental Consciousness. From there it reverberates and constructs different lev-\nels of creation. Gandharva Veda is the basis of all order and harmony in Nature, \ntherefore is [sic!] has that most harmonizing, most integrating influence \u201d (cp. \nhttp://gandharva -veda.com/page4.htm , July 10, 2018.) \n26  For a discussion and an overview of the tec hniques in the Maharishi movement , \ncp. Jeannotat  2008 : 285\u2013 307. \n27  The terminology \u201cwest\u201d  here is set in quotation marks to emphasize the pejorative \nhistory of the terminology and undifferentiated dichotomy that is implied in its \nuse. My own understanding of \u201cwest\u201d  is in accordance with Talal Asad \u2019s: \u201cThere \nis in my view the west, but I think it is best regarded neither as a geographical \nplace nor as a self -contained civilization, but as a hegemonic project, global in \nscope.\u201d (2006 : lecture ).  \n28  Hanegraff (1996) sees the concepts of holism, mildness and the  harmonization \nand integration of body and mind as central aspects of \u201cholistic medicine \u201d arising \nout of the Holistic Health Movement. Like the latter , holistic medicine has the \ngoal of healing the  person  as a whole. In this constellation, every individual is 146 | Antony George Pattathu  \nNew Age Ayurveda (2001: 13). He frames this concept as follows: \u201cThe most \nrecent manifestation of Ayurveda is found in the Western world. It combines the spiritual and ideological elements of the New Age Movement with an ancient Indian medical tradition to produce New Age Ayurveda\u201d (ibid.: 26). \nIn this way Zysk implicitly gives Ayurveda a religious characterization and \ncreates an antagonism between what he perceives as authentic Ayurveda in India and his concept of New Age Ayurveda in the West (ibid.).\n29 Using his \ndescription of what authentic Ayurveda is, Zysk replicates the opposing forces of the field, thus supporting the emic authenticity discourse of its prac-titioners in Germany and India, instead of describing the discourse and mul-\ntiplicity of Ayurvedic practices and trying to understand why and how this \nauthenticity is claimed to work.\n30 The phrase \u201cNew Age Ayurveda\u201d also has \na stereotyping effect and excludes the highly politicized discussion over r e-\nligion and spirituality among the community of practitioners (Warrier 2011: 87). The aim of this article is to understand how specific truth claims within Ayurveda in relation to religion and medicine are construed within the field \nand how they stand in relation to the potential for religious embodiment \n(Langford 2002: 2). The critical reception of this categorization of New Age Ayurveda by practitioners is illustrated by the following quote:  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \nconsidered to be  an interdependence of body, mind and emotions. The healing \nprocess involves all these aspects and goes even deeper, as the interdependence \nthat constitutes the individual is itself constituted by the universe , and the healing \nprocess addresses precisely this inner connection and power. The power of the mind o ver the body is a crucial feature of this healing process and has the potential \nto heal, but at the same time it is a source of illness. The individual must under-\nstand the deeper meanings of the disease and hence become the center of treat-ment (Hanegraaff 1996 : 53\u201355). \n29  Wujastyk and Smith (2008) also apply the concept of \u201cNew Age Ay urveda \u201d by \nreferring to Zysk an d describe it as one of three forms of \u201cglobal Ayurveda \u201d that \nhave evolved outside the Indian context in different regions. In their conceptual-\nization, \u201cNew Age Ayurveda \u201d stands in opposition to the secularized Ayurveda \nthat is practiced in India (2008 : 2). \n30  For a similar  argument concerning the authenticity of Ayurveda in the W est, cp. \nOtten 1996 and Zimmerman  1992.  Both come to the conclusion that Ayurveda in \nthe West is merely sold as a form of rehabilitation and wellness therapy , not as \ncodified medical system.  Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment  | 147 \n \n \u201cThis Ayurvedic department is not a \u2018wellness center\u2019; patients  usually come here to \ntreat or prevent diseases. It also must be stressed that Ayurveda, as it is understood \nhere, is not a spiritual discipline, nor is it \u2018New Age Ayurveda.\u2019 [\u2026] Rather, it is a medical discipline in continuation of a centuries old tradit ion.\u201d (Chopra 2008: 244)  \n \nThis positioning of the practitioner\u2019s field is that described by Ananda Samir \nChopra,31 a medical doctor and chief physician at the Habichtswald Klinik in \nKassel. He explicitly positions himself, his facility, and his practice in oppo-sition to Zysk\u2019s categorization. The economic situation and the marketing strategies of Ayurveda as a form of wellness are another source of opposi-\ntion. In particular, the academic ascriptions that categorize Ayurveda as reli-\ngious or spiritual reveal another facet of the discursive field that addresses the practice of Ayurveda in Germany. The efforts to legitimize Ayurveda as a medical system in Germany are fully evident in Chopra\u2019s statement. \nThe fact that in Germany, Ayurveda is inclined towards spirituality and \nreligion is not only evident in respect of its historical development, is also \nvalidated in a recent study from the medical field by Kessler et al. (2013). \nThe positioning of both practitioners and patients in relation to religion, spir-ituality, and medicine was assessed using a primarily quantitative approach. In total 140 people formed part of the evaluation cluster and were questioned by means of a questionnaire. Of those, 70 were practitioners and 70 were patients. It should be pointed out that 73% of all respondents viewed Ayur-\nveda as a form of spirituality and only 11% as a religion, while 100% under-\nstood Ayurveda as a health science and 95% as a medical system ( Kessler et \nal. 2013: 5). For the respondents Ayurveda therefore embodies aspects of spirituality, religion and science. However, it is the medical dimension of Ayurveda that comes first for them, and they do not exclude the possibility of combining it with biomedicine (ibid.: 6). \nThe arguments of Kessler et al. (2013) and Chopra (2008) make it clear \nthat the connection with spirituality and religion requires further considera-tion in respect of practitioner-patient relations and the question of how reli-gion and spirituality are dealt with in practice (cp. section 6). \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n31  Chop ra is an indologist and works on different projects at the intersection of med-\nical anthropology and indology. His person also exemplifies the plurality of the \ndiscursive field, because he is active in different fields and has multiple qualifi-\ncations.  148 | Antony George Pattathu  \nIn addition, the medical understanding of Ayurveda and its practice, as \nwell as the self-positioning and understanding of Ayurveda practitioners, \nshould be analyzed against the background of a health-care system that is dominated by biomedical agents and institutions, showing how this influ-\nences the field and its practitioners (cp. section 5). \nThese examples make it clear that academic ascriptions of Ayurveda in \nrelation to religion and spirituality form part of the tensions arising in the \npositionings between religion and medicine and that they also influence the potential for religious embodiment. What is interesting in Zysk\u2019s contribu-tion (2001) and Chopra\u2019s reaction (2008), as well as in the historical devel-\nopment of Ayurveda in Germany, is the connection of Ayurveda to the New \nAge Movement. Koch has already drawn attention to this, and Zysk also em-phasizes it in connection with the Holistic Health Movement in support of his own conceptualization of Ayurveda. The medical sociologist Sita Reddy (2000) also shows this for North America, emphasizing that Ayurveda is in-creasingly framed as a form of holistic health care and arguing that this is an \nadaptation to the American context reflecting the influence of New Age \nmovements. For her, this connection between Ayurveda and spirituality be-comes a form of symbolic capital in the health-care market while at the same time being the pivotal point in the critiques of biomedicine made by Ayur-vedic practitioners (2000: 5). \nThe aspect of \u201cholism\u201d and holistic healing is a crucial part of the Ayur-\nveda \u201cidentity marker\u201d as construed by academic discourse. This is also the case for Anne Koch\u2019s \u201cweb-ethnography\u201d (2005a).\n32 In her investigations of \nweb representations of ten Ayurveda providers from 2004 she systematically analyzes the credibility, representation, language, and aesthetics of the Ayur-veda offering. In doing so, she develops an aesthetic content cluster that \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n32  Koch\u2019s  publications elaborately cover different aspects of Ayurveda in Germany. \nShe has worked on the representation of Ayurveda in cookbooks and religious \ncodification in Ayurvedic nutrition ( cp. Koch 2005b), the attractiveness of Ayur-\nveda as an alternative healing system (cp. 2006), the ethical plausibility patterns \nof Ayurveda in the West , and the \u201cf ormation of German Ayurvedas \u201d examined \non the basis of their presence  on the web  (cp. 2005a ). In this contribution, the \nresults of the web ethnography are ref erred to especially since they imply direct \nconnections to the practitioners in the ethnographical research and the quoted \nwords of A.S. Chopra.  Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment  | 149 \n \n exposes the semantic stereotypes of the web representation. Here the first six \nof eleven points are of importance regarding the discursive field constituted by Ayurveda, religion, and medicine in Germany:  \n \n\u201c1. Authentication/standardization of the offer; 2. Origin and dating of Ayurveda, def-\ninition (e.g. health science, [natural] healing system, alternative medicine), possibly  \nmentioning the earliest written sources; 3. Labeling of Ayurveda, mostly as gentle, individual, complementary, holistic; 4. Theory of the elements and tri -dosha teaching \nwith balance; 5. Types of constitution; 6. Pathology: dosha, equilibrium theory.\u201d \n(Koch 2005a: 35 \u201336, author\u2019s translation)\n33 \n \nThese semantic stereotypes resonate with the findings of my own ethno-\ngraphic research and are often mentioned in the positionings of the practi-tioners. The statement by Chopra quoted above is a further example that em-\nphasizes this resonance through the definition, dating, and authentication of Ayurveda, which are important criteria for the positionings of those Ayur-veda practitioners who want to frame Ayurveda as a medical discipline. The \nfeatures of \u201cmildness\u201d, \u201cindividual,\u201d and \u201cholistic\u201d reoccur in debates on au-\nthenticity and are used to condemn Ayurveda as practiced in the West as inauthentic (cp. footnote 26). After a qualitative description of the web pages and a compilation of the semantic stereotypes, Koch introduces her results with the following words: \u201cWe could observe the establishment of a federal German \u2018holistic religion.\u2019 Healing, categorization, meditation, and civiliza-\ntion-critical stress management all play roles within it\u201d (Koch 2005a: 40, au-\nthor\u2019s translation).\n34 Characteristics drawn from the results of the analysis \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n33  The other aspects of the semantic stereotypes are: \u201c7. Highlighting the prevention \nand benefits of chronic d iseases, lists of indication ; 8. explanation of the treatment \nmethods, especially Panchakarma ; information on other included holistic proce-\ndures:  yoga, meditation, color therapy, psychotherapy, conventional medicine \netc.; 9. Nutrition ; 10. Service : accommo dation, costs, directions, price lists ; 11. \nDisclaimer .\u201d (Koch 2005a : 36). \n34  A localization of Ayurveda in the religious field is also carried out by Hubert \nKnoblauch : \u201cAn impressive example of the spiritual form of medicine is certainly \nAyurveda, which h as spread throughout Germany since the 1990s.\u201d (2009: 168). \nKnoblauch largely draws on the contributions by Anne Koch to locate Ayurveda in the field of popular religion.  150 | Antony George Pattathu  \nare thus used to define Ayurveda as a specific form of religion based on \u201cho-\nlism.\u201d \nThe different positions in the academic field in Germany have shown that \nthe discourse marker \u201cholism/holistic\u201d repeatedly became the decisive crite-\nrion in locating Ayurveda in the religious field. The idea of holism as an \naspect of the historical development of Ayurveda can be related to the argu-ments of authors like Zysk (2001), Reddy (2000), Koch (2005a, 2005b) and L\u00fcddeckens (2018) that Ayurveda belongs to the New Age, as in the case of Maharishi Ayurveda. These arguments locating Ayurveda in the religious field can be verified through the understanding of practitioners and patients \nthat Ayurveda is spiritual or a religion (cp. Kessler et al. 2013). However, \nthese arguments and statements oppose the statements of Chopra and other practitioners while also hiding the aspect of the self-image of Ayurveda prac-titioners that locates them primarily in the realm of medicine.  \nThe discursive field constituted by Ayurveda, religion, and medicine in \nGermany is characterized by diverse positions within the field. Media repre-\nsentations, academic positions, and practitioners\u2019 views support and/or con-\ntest each other, each presenting a conception of what the Ayurveda \u201cidentity marker\u201d means by using different discourse markers. These positions\u2014that is, Ayurveda as a religion based on semantic stereotypes (cp. Koch 2005a, 2005b), Ayurveda as a medical discipline based on tradition (cp. Chopra 2008; Kessler et al . 2013), and Ayurveda as spiritual through its connection \nto New Age movements and notions of holistic health (cp. Reddy 2000; Zysk 2001)\u2014take part in constant processes of exchange. In particular, the efforts of practitioners to establish Ayurveda as a medical discipline in a biomedi-cally dominated health-care system illustrate a basic hierarchical difference, as well as saying something about power relations between the different de-fining agents and institutions. This influences the positions of practitioners \nand their self-image, as well as their understandings of Ayurveda and how \nthey represent and define it in the face of agents in the discursive field.  \n  Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment  | 151 \n \n 5  DISCURSIVE EXCHANGE PROCESSES  \n \nBased on the interview statements of the practitioners involved in my ethno-\ngraphic research, this section will discuss their positions in relation to Ayur-\nveda, biomedicine, and religion, as well as showing how these positions are characterized by different discursive processes of exchange. To understand the relationship between Ayurveda and religion in terms of the practitioners\u2019 self-conceptions and practices, one must first understand the relationship of \nAyurveda to biomedicine. None of the practitioners referred to the relation-\nship of Ayurveda to religion or spirituality as a primary discursive marker. \nInstead they saw Ayurveda as a CAM or a medical system, also stressing the explanation of Ayurveda as holistic, without necessarily pointing to any re-ligious or spiritual dimension it might have. \nWithin a biomedically dominated health-care system, Ayurvedic practice \nis constantly being transformed and subjected to biomedical processes of ad-\naptation, which can be observed in the translation of Ayurvedic principles \ninto the biomedical system. These adaptations and translations are necessary in order to be able to practice Ayurveda within a biomedical health system. \nOn the official level, Ayurveda in Germany cannot be practiced as an \nofficially recognized medical system like biomedicine in Germany or Ayur-veda in India.\n35 \nFor economic reasons, Heilpraktiker , physicians, and BAMS practition-\ners often have no other option than to balance between the dominant media representations and images of Ayurveda as wellness and its representation as an alternative healing method and then to imply their own understanding of Ayurveda, whether as purely medical or as connected with a spiritual prac-tice, in their practice and in respect of practitioner-patient interactions. In \nrecent years there has been an increase in statements in academic publishing \nby German practitioners positioning Ayurveda in the medical field and breaking up the tension in the field described above. The conception of Ayur-veda as a \u201cWhole Medical System\u201d by Kessler and Michalsen (2012) pro-vides an example of this.\n36 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n35  For an outline of the historical process of the state re cognition of Ayurveda in \nIndia, cp. Wujastyk and Smith 2008: 8 \u20139. \n36  \u201cWhole medical systems are eo ipso complete and coherent systems of medical \ntheory that have evolved, and continue evolving, in different regions, cultures and 152 | Antony George Pattathu  \nIf experts were to practice Ayurveda as a recognized medical system, a \ncompletely different corpus of laws would apply, and the administration of \nmany Ayurvedic medicines would no longer be possible unless they fulfilled the requirements of the laws on medicines. BAMS Shulaji, one of my inter-\nviewees who is a senior Ayurvedic doctor at a center with thirty beds, em-phasized that he is forced to register his facility as a business and that he has to label Ayurveda \u201cwellness,\u201d even though he does not perceive his practice in any way as wellness. The status of Ayurveda in Germany leaves him in a legally gray area. When I asked him about the administration of Ayurvedic medicines in his institution, he replied:  \n \n\u201cWe give herbal tea s. Kashayam  [an Ayurvedic concoction] is actually a herbal med-\nicine, but we are giving it as a tea. You know, here, everywhere there are loopholes. \nIf you say kashayam  is a medicine you are not allowed to use it. But if you declare it \nis a tea, you are all owed.\u201d (Shulaji, BAMS, 10.12.2008)  \n \nThe clinical trials required to legitimize Ayurvedic medicines in accordance with German law are very costly, and often the financial resources are not available to perform pharmacological and clinical studies. These studies are slowly increasing in number, but they are still faced with the fundamental problem that the principles of Ayurveda have to be translated into a biomed-\nical context.\n37 \nThis shows that institutional influences (e.g. from the Federal Institute \nfor Drugs and Medical Devices) on the discourse constituted by Ayurveda, \nreligion, and medicine creates multiple processes of exchange, practices, and descriptions that provide the \u201cidentity marker\u201d (e.g. Ayurveda as wellness, Ayurveda as religion, Ayurveda as a medical system). These descriptions and \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \ntime periods around the globe, independently from mod ern western medicine \n[\u2026]. Here, the most well -known traditional Indian system of medicine, Ayurveda, \ncan spearhead as pars pro toto for all others for a particular reason : on top of its \ninbound coherence it possesses an inherent outbound quality of opennes s to its \nsurrounding realities.\u201d  (Kessler /Michalsen 2012 : 65) This definition and the re-\nlated article clarify the efforts to legitimize Ayurveda and give it a firm and rec-\nognized place in the German health- care system.  \n37  For a similar situation integrating kanpo  medicine as a form of \u201ctraditional medi-\ncine\u201d into biomedicine in Japan , see Schrimpf , this volume. Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment  | 153 \n \n attributions to Ayurveda are related to each other in a complex discursive \nnetwork and influence each other. The relationship of Ayurveda to biomedi-cine is hegemonic and forces Ayurveda practitioners to define Ayurveda in a variety of ways. Therefore, none of the practitioners interviewed denied the \nreference to or the involvement of biomedicine, an expression of the discur-\nsive premise that biomedicine has to be integrated.  \nThe positions of the practitioners and their representations of Ayurveda \nmust in this sense be understood as multiple. Different dimensions of the practice reflect the situation and hierarchies within medical pluralism and the vexed relationship with religion. In this connection, the following statement \nby medical anthropologists Sarah Cant and Ursula Sharma on the situation \nof CAM therapies applies to the positioning of Ayurveda in the German health- care system:  \n \n\u201cIn as much as these forms have not been totally incorporated into biomedical prac-\ntices and knowledge they do not share biomedicine\u2019s privileged relation to the state, \nthough the precise nature and degree of their delegitimation varies from case to case and from country to country.\u201d (Cant and Sharma 1999: 6)  \n \nThis also becomes evident at the practitioner level, as is clearly seen in the statement of Dr Tumar, an Ayurvedic practitioner and medical doctor: \u201c Doc-\ntors of modern medicine tell me that I do not have a clue and because I do \nnot have a clue, this is why I am using alternative medicine \u201d (Dr Tumar, \nphysician, 10.12.2008). Delegitimization is not only perpetrated by one\u2019s \npeers, as in the case of Dr Tumar, it also appears through the association with religion, that is, in practice. When asked about the role that religion plays in his practice, BAMS Shulaji answered as follows:   \n\u201cNo, we are not doing that, especially because we are Indians. We have our religion \nand our culture, but I don\u2019t want to implement that in this center with Indian medita-tion and everything. [\u2026] I say you can believ e in whatever you believe God is. There \nis one energy, and I am born in a Hindu family. We have employees from the Muslim and Christian religion here, but we do only Ayurvedic treatment, nothing more. If you start and make some meditation and everything, t he local publics will start and say: \n\u2018That is a sect\u2019. [\u2026] We have to be careful [\u2026] .\u201d (Shulaji, BAMS 10.12.2008)  \n 154 | Antony George Pattathu  \nThis statement by Shulaji expresses his concern about implementing religion \nin his practice without denying his own religious background. The associa-tions he makes with meditation and his fear of being identified as a \u201csect\u201d resonate with the historical development of Ayurveda in Germany and the \npractice of Maharishi Ayurveda, as depicted in Der Spiegel .\n38 This is an ex-\nample of one of the arguments in which the relationship of Ayurveda to reli-\ngious embodiment is rejected, since religion is viewed as a de-legitimizing factor and a danger to the practice. The same applies to Chopra, quoted ear-lier, who does not situate his Ayurvedic institution and practice in the field of wellness or spirituality, but sees it as a medical discipline. Chopra\u2019s oppo-\nsition reveals a clear strategy to legitimize Ayurveda as a medical discipline. \nTo be publicly perceived as a secular medical discipline, the aspects of w ell-\nness and spirituality must be excluded. \nWith regard to the school of Maharishi Ayurveda, it is particularly inter-\nesting that the three participants in the ethnographic research who called themselves Maharishi Ayurveda practitioners have moved away from admin-\nistering and combining transcendental meditation with their Ayurveda prac-\ntice. One reason for this was the cost of the meditation courses. One of the doctors emphasized that, although she still indeed regularly advises on TM and recommends its effects to every patient, that is not a condition for thera-peutic treatment, a position held by all three Maharishi practitioners. \nHowever, one example of religious embodiment in Ayurveda is transcen-\ndental meditation. This is connected to a broader belief system in which the individual practice of the patient has an effect on the whole of humanity, affects the cosmos, and influences the Doshas (Newcombe 2008: 263). The positions of the practitioners presented so far show a clear aversion to di-rectly combining Ayurveda and religion. Kessler et al.\u2019s and Koch's studies, on the other hand, clearly stress the religious or spiritual aspects of Ayurveda. \nThis was also the case for the practitioners in my ethnographic research when \nit comes to therapeutic measures and consultation. \nHowever, it becomes clear that the answer to the question of whether \nAyurveda has a religious aspect has to start with the practitioners\u2019 own posi-tions and their economic and legal strategies. Here a political dimension is recognizable, as shown by the statements of BAMS Shulaji and the Mahari-\nshi practitioners in my ethnographic research, as well as by Chopra. Dr \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n38  See the above quote from Schwertfeger 2004 : 7.  Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment  | 155 \n \n Tumar mentioned that, in cases of doubt involving a particular colleague, she \nwould conceal the religious connotations that Ayurveda has for her, seeing this aspect as crucial not for the scientific evaluation of Ayurveda, but for the relationship between practitioner and patient (Dr Tumar, physician, \n10.12.2008). \nThe relationships between Ayurveda, religion, and medicine are more \ncomplex than the frequent situating of Ayurveda in the religious field sug-\ngests. Therefore, a thorough analysis of the practice, practitioner-patient re-lations, and the respective prevailing conditions should reveal how they in-fluence the potential for religious embodiment.  \nFundamentally, it should be remembered that the relationship between \npractitioner and patient has a foundation of trust in which the practitioners introduce their respective understandings of Ayurveda. The initial consulta-tion and the teaching of the Doshas play a central role in both the individual treatment and the patients\u2019 understandings of Ayurveda, as well as in respect of religious embodiment into the therapy. \n  \n6  THE POTENTIAL OF RELIGIOUS EMBODIMENT IN  \nAYURVEDA THERAPY  \n Consultations as a means of therapeutic practice in Ayurveda are particularly relevant to the question of how far certain elements of Ayurveda are consid-ered religious in the context of treatment, as well as in understanding how they find their way into therapy. Neither the study by Kessler et al. (2013) nor the studies by Koch (2005a, 2005b), L\u00fcddeckens (2018) or Zysk (2001) \ninvestigate how the relationship to religion and spirituality is dealt with on \nthe level of practitioner-patient relations. This article can only provide an initial insight into the potential for religious embodiment based on the anal-ysis of the discursive field and the perspectives and practices of certain prac-titioners of Ayurveda. The focus on religious embodiment would ideally re-quire a long- term and thorough study of practitioner-patient interactions and \nthe respective consultations. \nFundamental to the treatment, as all practitioners in my ethnographic re-\nsearch have stressed, is the initial consultation. It is on this occasion that the basics of Ayurvedic practice are explained in relation to the needs of the pa-tient and that the patient\u2019s initial resistance to or sympathy for a \u201creligious\u201d 156 | Antony George Pattathu  \ntherapy becomes apparent. In many consultations and treatments, religion or \nspirituality are not directly addressed in relation to Ayurveda unless this is desired by the patient. This requires some flexibility on the part of the prac-titioner in dealing with the patients. Apparently, a religious interpretation of \nAyurveda has to be understood as a process that can be established in the \ntreatment depending on the preferences of both the patient and the practi-tioner. In addition, these initial consultations with practitioners are supported by lectures in their clinical institutions. In the case of private clinics these are public lectures, while in the context of smaller facilities they are tailored to the patients\u2019 interests.  \nThe results presented in this article are based on interviews with practi-\ntioners. However, they highlight key elements of the consultations that ena-ble religious embodiment. \nHeilpraktiker  Lutz, who runs a small private practice in which he also \noffers outpatient therapies, begins his consultation with questions relating to a patient\u2019s birth (e.g. the circumstances of the birth process)\n and his or her \nsocial and family relations. The antagonism to common biomedical consul-tations can be seen when the patients express their surprise at the fact that the practitioners want to hear their individual stories in more detail. This is a common experience shared by most practitioners, as BAMS Shulaji and other practitioners reported (Pattathu 2009: 62\u201377). Based on the initial con-sultation and the description of the Doshas, it is possible to show how reli-\ngious embodiment may take place. It is a crucial factor that the depiction of \nthe Doshas gives the patient the opportunity to become familiar and identify with the Ayurvedic categories. The following interview excerpt conveys how Heilpraktiker  Lutz introduces the concept of Doshas in his consultations:  \n \n\u201cThe Doshas vata, pitta and kapha [\u2026] I describe for example vata as vayu (wind), its \nakasha (ether) and vayu. Wind and ether, I tell them, for example, vata is a very thin \nperson, tall or small, and because of what? The wind is cooling, makes the people cold, wind is drying. If there is water it dries the water, it dries the skin, the eyes, the \nhair, some organs, the stool, and this main center of vata is the colon [\u2026] for example kapha is water and earth. If wind blows into the earth like in the desert, the sand is \nflying away, so you need some water to make a sandcastle. I tell them, if you do some \ncastles at the seaside, sand alone is nothing, but you need the water and, well, also \npitta. These elements, 20% water and mostly fire, it holds the temperature, it makes \nthe metabolism.\u201d ( Lutz, healing practitioner, 18.12.2008)  Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment  | 157 \n \n All practitioners refer to the Doshas as the main concept that constitutes the \nrelationship between illness and health. The Doshas are described as part of the biological process and the physical nature of the body, but always in re-lation to the mental characteristics and traits of the person. They are based \non a selection of the five elements of fire, water, earth, air / wind and space \n/ ether, which are part of the nature of all substances and form an integral part of the Ayurvedic cosmology, as Lutz explained in the course of the in-terview. At the same time, he showed the applicability of the teaching of the Doshas to the environment. For example, wind as part of vata, having the property of drying, dries the skin and clarifies the relation of the Doshas to \nthe body. This basic tenet of Ayurveda explains the role of the body as con-\nnecting the outside world of the patient with his or her inner world. Through the Doshas, which are based on the elements, the outside world affects the human body.  \nThe Doshas are the central principles in Ayurvedic teachings and are \nwhat enables the identification of Ayurveda as \u201cholistic.\u201d They are repre-\nsentative of the overcoming of the mind-body opposition, since every Dosha \nis understood both physically and mentally. For Zysk and Koch this aspect is a clear reference to the New Age or Holistic Health Movements, which place Ayurveda in the religious domain. The role of the elements with regard to notions of harmonization, balance, and relation to the cosmos is one reason why Koch categorizes Ayurveda as a form of religion.  \nThese aspects are in fact the focal point of the potential for religious em-\nbodiment. Yet in order to see how religious embodiment takes plac e as a \nprocess of negotiation, the perspectives of the practitioners and patients must be taken into account. According to one of the Maharishi practitioners, the process of religious embodiment begins just through the setting of his clinic and the Vedic Gandharva music, which brings both his Doshas and those of \nhis patients into balance. In this way practitioners and patients can feel, think, \nand identify with the elements and the Doshas, which, according to the reli-gious views of the Maharishi, bring them into harmony with the cosmic or-der.  \nThe patients can actively participate in the embodiment of Ayurveda, \nsince they are guided by the practitioner\u2019s explanations and can re-consoli-\ndate their identity within the doctrine of the Doshas. The problem of the le-\ngitimacy of Ayurveda is rooted in a clash of two discursive premises, namely \nthe biomedical and Ayurvedic perspectives, but this can be transformed into 158 | Antony George Pattathu  \na dialogue that is further developed in the practitioner-patient relationship. \nSome informal discussions with patients during the ethnographic research described just such a dialogue. According to them, their illnesses and per-sonalities were recreated through the dialogue with the practitioners and their \nexplanations. \nIn light of Judith Butler\u2019s conceptualization of speech, the illness of the \npatient, her identification with the disease, and her identity are all re-signified \nperformatively through the terms of the Doshas. This resignification partly takes place in the communication between the practitioner and the patient, as well as in her own reflections and conversations about this process. Simi-\nlarly, as the word \u201cqueer\u201d is re-signified from a hurtful slur into a positive \nidentity, the Doshas enable a positive identification for the patients (Butler 2006: 28).\n39 Whereas from a biomedical perspective the body and in a sense \nthe identity of the patient are conceptualized as \u201csick\u201d, that is, as pathologi-cal, this identity is re-evaluated in the communication between the Ayurveda practitioner and the patient. By means of the Dosha concept body and iden-\ntity are re-consolidated, not as ill but as \u201cout of balance\u201d. This process affects \neveryday life, since the Dosha teachings are linked to the patients\u2019 daily ac-tivities, for example, through dietetics.  \nThe results of Christine Kupfer s thesis, \u201cCaring for the Whole Self: How \nGerman Patients Use Ayurvedic Concepts\u201d (2006), also describe everyday use of the Doshas by patients. Over a period of three weeks, she observed the \ntherapy process of Ayurveda patients in an Ayurvedic clinic and interviewed \ntwenty patients. She came to the conclusion that for many patients the Doshas represent one of the central building blocks in their conceptualization of Ayurveda. For the patients, the Doshas are a vehicle of self-empowerment\n40 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n39  \u201cMore generally, then, this suggests that the changeable power of such terms \nmarks a kind of di scursive performativity that is not a discrete series of speech \nacts, but a ritual chain of resignifications whose origin and end remain unfixed and unfixable. In this sense, an \u201cact\u201d is not a momentary happening, but a certain \nnexus of temporal horizons, the condensation of an iterability that exceeds the \nmoment it occasions. The possibility for a speech act to resignify a prior context depends, in part, upon the gap between the originating context or intention by which an utterance is animated and the eff ects it produces .\u201d (Butler 1997 : 14). \n40  With regard to self -empowerment in the context of alternative therapies, see \nZeugin,  L\u00fcddeckens , Schrimpf and L\u00fcddeckens in this volume.  \u2019Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment  | 159 \n \n that they can use to maintain their own individuality, autonomy, and deci-\nsions regarding their own self-care, as well as their healing process (Kupfer 2006: 110\u2013114). Kupfer does not neglect the role of the practitioners\u2019 in-structions in this regard. She explains how they support the patients and con-\ntribute to a better understanding of the concepts. She also stresses that \nthrough the Doshas patients become able to access Ayurveda on the basis of their previous knowledge and to confirm this knowledge with a new vocab-ulary associated with the Doshas (ibid: 72). \nEspecially at this level of individual trust and communication in the in-\nteraction between practitioner and patient, both the social circumstances of \nthe patients and their possible reservations have to be taken into account. In \nthis regard, the sensitive character of the practitioner-patient relationship re-quires great flexibility on the part of the former. Dr Tumar emphasized this point when it comes to linking Ayurveda to religion during consultations and therapy:  \n \n\u201cSo you can use it, and that is a very nice thing about Ayurveda, that, according to the \nlevel of your patient, you can stay on a functional level. But the more you realize the patient opens up to more, the more you can also kind of intr oduce terms like prana. \nYou can introduce terms like chakra; you can show what the different chakras\u2019 ener-gies are for. Whatever their \u2018thing\u2019 is. [\u2026] You have incredible options in Ayurveda. You can start with simple oils and herbs, [\u2026] the physical thera py, and you can go to \nthe extremely subtle and extremely fine therapies, depending on what level the patient is ready to come with you.\u201d (Dr Tumar, physician, 10.12.2008)  \n \nThis statement by Dr Tumar is central to the understanding of religious em-bodiment in Ayurvedic treatment, showing that the field of tension between religion and medicine requires a flexible and individual approach to religion \nin practice. The possibilities of Ayurveda being practiced on a functional \nlevel and of introducing religious or philosophical concepts prove the nego-tiable character of religious embodiment in Ayurveda.\n41 \n  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n41  This kind of flexibility is interpreted by L\u00fcddeckens as a characteristic o f CAM , \nseen as a \u201cloosely coupled field .\u201d See L\u00fcddeckens , this volume.  160 | Antony George Pattathu  \n7  CONCLUSION  \n \nThe positionings and voices of practitioners in a field that is characterized by \na religious understanding of Ayurveda, and the interest in establishing Ayur-\nveda as a recognized medical system, are central but also conflictual ele-ments in the field of discourse that constitutes Ayurveda, religion, and med-icine in Germany. Practitioners, patients, media presentations, and recipi-ents\u2019 perspectives\u2014in short, the entire discourse community involved in the articulation of Ayurveda\u2014should be included in observations of this field. \nThe construction of Ayurveda as a counterpart to religion in the sense of \n\u201cNew Age Ayurveda\u201d (Zysk 2001) or as a \u201cFederal German holistic religion\u201d (Koch 2005a) represents a categorization that omits key aspects of the prac-tice and conceptions of Ayurveda in the emic, popular, and scientific under-standings of Ayurvedic practitioners and scholars.  \nAyurveda has many spiritual and religious connotations, as is evident \nfrom the historical development of Ayurveda in Germany, in which the Ma-harishi movement has been a central player, as well as in the emic perspec-tives described in the study by Kessler et al. (2013).  \nThe discursive approach using the perspectives of medical anthropology \nand religious studies showed on the one hand how practitioners position themselves within a biomedical field that is determined by a hegemonic re-\nlationship with biomedicine. On the other hand, it revealed how the different \nauthorities in the field influence practitioners\u2019 positions through the distinc-tions they make between religion and medicine. I argue that Ayurveda is constituted and defined in multiple ways, which also determine the possibil-ities of religious embodiment. \nUsing the teachings about the Doshas as an example, it was possible in \nthis article to show how they serve as a means to enable the patient to identify with a particular concept of Ayurveda and hence enable religious embodi-ment. The Doshas provide a way to re-define one's identity. If and how Ayur-veda provides a religious connotation as an aspect of this identity depends on the respective patient and practitioner. Hence a flexible treatment of Ayur-veda, whether on the medical level and/or on the religious level, is based in \nthe procedural relationship between practitioner and patient. \nThe aim of this article has been to show how Ayurveda as a medical sys-\ntem is entangled with religion and biomedicine and to analyze how it offers \nthe potential for religious embodiment, especially in the initial consultation Ayurveda \u2014Discursive Formations: Religion, Medicine , Embodiment  | 161 \n \n and the practitioner-patient relationship. The conditions for this religious em-\nbodiment are already determined by the ways in which practitioners position themselves in the German health-care market, and they require flexibility in their approach to Ayurveda, religion, and medicine. \nThe various positions in the discursive field constituted by Ayurveda, re-\nligion, and medicine, and the processes of negotiation that became obvious through the interviews and the ethnographic fieldwork, both revealed the po-tential for religious embodiment in theory and practice. The positionalities and power relations in the field require additional ethnographic research on practitioner-patient interactions and consultations. This will enable us to \nopen up new perspectives that leave room for exploring the voices of those \nconcerned in order to capture the complexities of Ayurveda in Germany.  \n \n \nBIBLIOGRAPHY  \n Asad, Talal (2006): Thinking about Blasphemy and Secular Criticism, Stan-\nford University, lecture, 9 October 2006. \nBergunder, Michael (2008): \u201cWas ist Esoterik?

While biomedicine observes the social differentiation between \nmedicine and religion, holistic healing systems integrate the two. After clarifying im-portant terms, this article begins with a  brief sketch of research on these topics. Re-\nferring to Ann Swidler\u2019s concept of the \u201ctool kit,\u201d it suggests an explanation for the attractiveness of CAM to both patients and practitioners. Drawing on relevant studies and data from the author\u2019s qualitative  study of palliative care, it argues that the attrac-\ntion of CAM lies in its function as a tool kit that is not differentiated into medicine and religion but is characterized internally by being a loosely coupled field that offers a resource for self -empowe rment.  \n \n \n1  INTRODUCTION  \n The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by the general \npopulation in many countries, such as the United States, the United King-\ndom, Japan, and Switzerland, is substantial.\n1 Indeed, CAM therapies are \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1  Surveys suggest that the use of CAM increased in the United States (Eisenberg et \nal. 1998) until around 2000 and that it has been more or less steady in several 168 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens  \n practiced within the conventional health-care systems of modern western \ncountries, as well as outside them. Referring to the United States, Kaptchuk and Eisenberg state that \n \n\u201c[...] substantial portions of the medical system have begun to seek reconciliation with \nalterna tive medicine. Managed care, insurance carriers, hospital providers, major ac-\nademic medical centers, and individual MDs are increasingly receptive to developing new \u2018integrative\u2019 models of health care [...]\u201d (2001: 193).  \n \nSimilarly, Frisk (2013: 388) notes the \u201cincreasingly blurred borders between \nthe medical mainstream and complementary and alternative therapies\u201d in \nSweden, while Wahlberg points out how \u201cvarious CAM therapies come to be mainstreamed into national health delivery...\u201d (2007: 2310) in the UK. The situation is similar in Switzerland, where a growing incorporation of CAM into both the academic educational system and public health care can be seen.\n2 This \u201creconciliation\u201d seems astonishing, given the in many respects \nsuccessful struggle of biomedicine against what it sees as \u201cheterodox\u201d heal-ing systems and actors. The evolution of modern biomedicine or so- called \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \ncountries since then (Hunt et al. 2010: 1501). For further information, cp. Harris \nand Rees 2000, Yamashita et al. 2002, Wolf et al. 2006, Harris et al. 2012, Becker \net al. 2010. One has to bear in mind that there is no uniform way to define CAM and operationalize its use. Whi le some studies include, for example, prayer or \ndietary supplements, others do not (Hunt et al. 2010: 1501). Therefore, it is diffi-cult to give accurate quantitative data about the popularity of CAM.  \n2  In 2009, 67 percent of Swiss voters supported a const itutional article on CAM \n(Federal constitution Art. 118a BV (new):  \u201cThe Federal government and cantons \nshall ensure that, within  the scope of their jurisdiction, complementary medicine \nis taken into consideration.\u201d Since  at least 2012  CAM  has slowly been integrated \ninto the Swiss public  health sector (https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/de/home/  \nthemen/strategien -politik/nationale -gesundheitspolitik/stand -umsetzung -des-\nneuen -verfassungsartikels -zur-komplementaermedizin.html?_organization=317, \n13 June 2017). Cp. also Martin and Debons 2015 . On CAM\u2019s institutional inte-\ngration into the Swiss academic educational system, cp., for instance, www.ikom.unibe.ch, May 18, 2017; www.iki.usz.ch, May 18, 2017; https://www.  \nhes-so.ch/de/bachelor -osteopathie- 3381.html , May 18, 2018;  for Germany,  cp., \nfor example,  Spielberg  2007.  De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 169 \n \n conventional medicine during the nineteenth century, which was closely en-\ntangled with the development of public health-care systems, is linked not only to the struggle of \u201corthodoxy\u201d against \u201cheterodoxy,\u201d\n3 but also to the \nsocial process described as \u201cdifferentiation\u201d (cp. Luhmann 1984, 1995; Par-\nsons 2001), including that between medicine as physical healing and religion \nas focusing on the metaphysical and transcendent aspects. As many healing practices and concepts belonging to CAM include such aspects, it is aston-ishing to see CAM becoming more and more established in institutionalized secular medical contexts. As I will argue below, I interpret this development as an indication of de-differentiation. \nMy aim in this article is to suggest an explanation for why, among other \npossible reasons, CAM is attractive in certain medical contexts by looking at the situation in Switzerland. In asking this question, I use Ann Swidler\u2019s con-cept of the \u201ctool kit\u201d (1986), outlining three specific traits that are consistent with many CAM therapies.\n4 Before doing so, I will clarify the relevant terms \nand give a very brief introduction to the historical background of modern \nmedicine and the process of social differentiation in Europe. \nThe theses presented in this article are backed up by empirical data de-\nrived from a Swiss research project on \u201cAlternative Religion at the End of \nLife,\u201d as well as by related studies by other authors. We conducted this pro-ject with Rafael Walthert, Mirjam Mezger\n5 and Barbara Zeugin in six health-\ncare institutions in the German-speaking part of Switzerland from 2013 to \n2016.6 We carried out qualitative research in different kinds of hospital, a \nhospice and a nursing home for the elderly. Two of these institutions had a \nspecific ideological background based in anthroposophy, but the others had none apart from the fact that they practiced biomedicine. In all six case stud-ies, we carried out participant observation and conducted guided interviews with nurses (28), doctors (11), therapists (17), chaplains (11), and in most \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n3  Cp., for example, Wahlberg 2007.  \n4  As this suggestion stems from a social -scientific position and reflects the non -\nnormative perspective of the Study of Religion, the potential medical effects of \nCAM will not be discussed in this article.  \n5  Cp.

We ana-\nlyzed the data based on the analytical background of grounded theory. The coding procedure was supported by Atlas ti. \n \n \n2  A MINEFIELD OF TERMS  \n \nKaptchuk and Eisenberg (2001: 189) called the taxonomy of contemporary \nunconventional healing practices a \u201clinguistic minefield\u201d. Further minefields \nare th e taxonomies of \u201cconventional healing practices,\u201d \u201creligion,\u201d and \u201cspir-\nituality.\u201d The use of these taxonomies is influenced by power struggles over \nlegitimation and is profoundly linked to value judgements. \nAccording to Ernst, the umbrella term \u201ccomplementary and alternative \nmedicine\u201d (CAM) \u201crefers to a diverse array of treatment modalities and di-agnostic techniques that are not presently considered part of conven-\ntional/mainstream medicine and emphasize a holistic approach towards \nhealth care\u201d (2008: 2). Kelner and Wellman\n7 explain that the \u201cconcept of \nCAM\u201d  covers  \n \n\u201c[\u2026] a diverse set of healing practices, which do not normally fit under the scientific \nmedical umbrella. Instead, these practices emphasize the uniqueness of each individ-\nual, integration of body , mind and spirit, the flow of energy as a source of healing, \nand disease as having dimensions beyond the purely biological. The life force is very \ncommonly seen as a crucial element of the healing process and strong emphasis is placed on the environment, the subjective experience of patients, the healing power \nof nature, and health as a positive state of being.\u201d (2000: 5)  \n \nCAM therefore unites very different healing practices and hence inevitably \nleads to unjustifiable generalizations.8 However, in this context, the term \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n7  Kelner and Wellman are referring here to the perspectives of Howard S. Berliner \nand J. Warren Salmon, as well as Michael Goldstein.  \n8  On the terminology here, cp. Koch 2015; Ernst 2008:2 \u20133. Similarly used terms \nare \u201cheterodox medicine\u201d and \u201cholistic medicine.\u201d  De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 171 \n \n \u201cbiomedicine\u201d refers to the more or less consistent medical system that is \nrestricted to the principles and academic knowledge of the natural sciences.9  \nI use the term \u201creligion\u201d as an etic term, including concepts and practices \nthat practitioners may not refer to as \u201creligion\u201d but as \u201cspirituality.\u201d This us-\nage is similar to that of Wouter J. Hanegraaff (2000), who also uses religion \nas an umbrella term, but differentiates between \u201ca religion\u201d (institutional-ized) and \u201ca spirituality\u201d (individual), both of them being \u201creligion\u201d. Adapt-ing Geertz, Hanegraaff defines \u201creligion\u201d as  \n \n\u201c[\u2026] any symbolic system which influences human action by providing possibilities \nfor ritually maintaining contact between the everyday world and a more general meta -\nempirical framework of meaning\u201d (2000: 295).  \n \nThis perspective is compatible with Luhmann\u2019s notion of religion, who states \nthat \u201ccommunication is always [\u2026] religious when it observes immanence from the point of view of transcendence [\u2026]\u201d (2002: 77).\n10 In this sense, \nsemantics can be called \u201creligious\u201d if something that is perceived as \u201cimma-nent\u201d is framed by something that is perceived as \u201ctranscendent\u201d (Luhmann 1989: 313\u2013316). \nFor various reasons I do not follow the emic distinction between \u201creli-\ngion\u201d and \u201cspirituality,\u201d which is often used in a highly normative way: reli-gion is seen as something institutionalized, which may be superficial, dog-\nmatic, exclusive, and intolerant, or even dangerous and aggressive, while \nspirituality is seen as experience- based , private, \u201cuniversal,\u201d and \u201cwhole-\nsome\u201d.\n11 These normative associations are often the reason why the respec-\ntive terms are used or rejected by particular agents.12 I wish to avoid the nor-\nmativity of these distinctions by using \u201creligion\u201d as an umbrella term. This \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n9  Other authors prefer terms such as \u201cconventional,\u201d \u201callopathic,\u201d \u201corthodox,\u201d \n\u201cWestern,\u201d or \u201cmodern\u201d medicine in this context.  \n10  English translation in Laermans/Verschraegen 2001: 15.  \n11  Cp. Sinclair et al. 2006: 475.  \n12  The right of religious freedom makes the label \u201creligion\u201d attractive to specific actors, while the aim of becoming integrated into secular systems, as for insta nce \ninto secular schools or secular hospitals, can cause its rejection and replacement with the label \u201cspirituality.\u201d  172 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens  \n also allows me to take the continuity between phenomena labeled \u201creligious\u201d \nor \u201cspiritual\u201d into account. \nAssuming a modern, Western, and Christian environment, in this paper, \n\u201calternative religion\u201d is understood as a relative concept referring to a pool \nof practices and concepts that are not commonly seen as forming part of the \ntraditional canon of Christianity in its institutionalized forms. Although they may even be more popular than traditional practices and concepts,\n13 in the \nWest they are seen as \u201calternative\u201d. This pool has no strict boundaries, and the respective practices and concepts\u2014such as, for example, belief in rein-carnation or meditation practices\u2014can also be found in conventional reli-\ngious communities, for instance in churches. There is a huge overlap with \ntendencies often called \u201cEsotericism\u201d (Frisk 2013: 373) or \u201cNew Age,\u201d which may themselves be influential. Referring to Hanegraaff, Steven J. Sut-cliffe (2014) has referred to this field of religion as \u201cNew Age sensu lato\u201d, that is, as a field that \u201cremain[s] analytically elusive despite [its] increased visibility in many societies\u201d and that tends to \u201cblur the boundaries between \nexpressions of \u2018religion\u2019 and \u2018culture\u201d\u2019 (2014: 42).  \nIn the case of health care, this blurring refers to the boundaries between \nexpressions of religion, medicine, and therapy. Since the first publication of \nNew Age Religion and Western Culture , this \u201cwider New Age movement\u201d \nhas diffused into the wider cultural and social environment of modern \u201csec-ular\u201d societies and therefore yielded a \u201cfluid New Age\u201d.\n14 \nIt is important to realize that there is no unified \u201cmovement\u201d or entity \nthat contains unifying concepts. Nevertheless, what could be called a \u201cfluid New Age\u201d and be seen as part of this \u201calternative religion\u201d may be delineated by the field\u2019s emphasis on emotions and subjective experiences, combined with an \u201cindividualistic orientation and a weak tendency to organization and holistic function\u201d (Knoblauch 2008: 142).\n15 Typical markers of \u201calternative \nreligion\u201d are the se lf-identity of being an alternative to something else (Sut-\ncliffe 2004: 467, 479), hence the conceptualization of the self as being dif-ferent from the kind of religion that is seen as traditional and conservative. This is frequently combined with a sense of belonging to the future, with a \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n13  Cp. Partridge 2005.  \n14  Cp. L\u00fcddeckens/Walthert 2010: 9 \u201317. \n15  Even if there is organization in this field, the self -perception is often in non- con-\nformity therewith.  De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 173 \n \n sense of having outgrown the old \u201cnarrow-minded\u201d religions and of belong-\ning to some kind of growing movement that is different from the predominant \nmaterialism. The narrative of the autonomy of the individual is crucial. The individual him- or herself is the guiding principle for the acceptance of au-\nthority and for decisions about orthodoxy and orthopraxy. One\u2019s own au-\nthentic experiences are the normative reference,\n16 and communicating \nchoices as individual ones is important. Paul Heelas (2002: 362) in particular called attention to the focus on life in the sense of one\u2019s own \u201ctrue inner life\u201d. Quite often it is the life and the focus on the body of the individual in the here and now and the aim of the progress of the individual \u2014her or his trans-\nformation into a higher spiritual and mental level (Frisk 2013: 373)\u2014that counts more than the prospect of an afterlife. As we shall see later, these aspects of alternative religion play a crucial role in the context of CAM. \n  \n3  THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN ACA DEMIC \nMEDICINE AND SOCIAL DIFFERENTIATION  \n \nThree linked developments are important to consider with regard to the evo-lution of biomedicine as a differentiated social subsystem in the Global \nNorth.\n17 These developments were responsible for the medical and social \nsuccess of biomedicine while at the same time giving rise to ongoing criti-\ncism.  \nFirst, the \u201cclinical gaze\u201d (Foucault 1973), decisive for the evolution of \nbiomedicine, went along with a social differentiation between physician and patient. Within the modern institution of the hospital, patients were no longer \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n16  Heelas and Woodhead choose to use the term \u201cspirituality\u201d and describe the same \nphenomenon by calling it a \u201csubjective turn\u201d (2005: 2 \u20135). The emphasis on the \nindividual is in accordance with Callum Brown s observation (200 6) of the narra-\ntive of individual self -fulfillment and personal freedom that has arisen since the \n1960s.  \n17  The developments described in what follows reflect the medical history of Euro-pean and subsequently North American societies. However, similar (at l east to a \ncertain extent) developments in the direction of the establishment of biomedicine took place in other parts of the world, as exemplified in this volume by case stud-ies in Tanzania (W. Bruchhausen), India (N. Rageth), and Japan (M. Schrimpf).  ,174 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens  \n in a feudal patron-client relationship but had become \u201cobjects\u201d for the phy-\nsician to work on. Moreover, the \u201ctransition from Bedside Medicine through Hospital Medicine to Laboratory Medicine was accompanied by a shift in cosmological form away from a person orientated towards an object orien-\ntated cosmology\u201d (Jewson 1976: 225).\n18 Medicine was no longer \u201cperson-\noriented,\u201d with the physician perceiving the patient as a \u201cholistic\u201d person, \nbut disease-oriented: patients were seen as separate from their social posi-tions, relationships, and social traits, and were only viewed from the aspect of a disease (cp. Vogd 2007; Schoene 1980). \n\u201cThe modification in professional self-understanding from a healer \nwhose duty is to preserve the patient as a creature of God in a more or less artistic way to a scientist whose duty is to understand illness in a rational way, also changed the attitude towards patients which, in the age of science, seems almo st indifferent, at least from today\u2019s standpoint.\u201d (Atzeni/von \nGroddeck 2015: 31) \n(Bio)medicine became confined to the empirical level, often being per-\nceived as fragmentary and mechanistic. Patients became bodies, and bodies were seen as matter. Atzeni and von Groddeck (2015: 30) analyzed doctors\u2019 autobiographies and summarized them with reference to the generation \u201cwho started their careers around the middle of the nineteenth century,\u201d as well as emphasizing the \u201cscientific aspect of medicine\u201d in their professional self-understanding: \n \n\u201cDoctors save bodies, not souls. This self -understanding is connected with the belief \nthat the human body is the sum of a person (biological reductionism). Through me-\nthodical examination, which Foucault describes as the \u2018medi cal gaze\u2019 on the body \n(Foucault, [1976] 1994), the doctor deduces symptoms, illnesses, and causes by ap-plying scientific methods.\u201d (Atzeni/von Groddeck 2015: 30)  \n \nHence, patients might experience themselves as being reduced to a diagno-\nsis\u2014a person as a patient seems to be nothing more than his or her illness.19 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n18  On the development from patient -centered to physician -centered medicine, cp. \nLachmund/Stollberg 1995.  \n19  \u201cFrom the late 1960s onwards, the image of the heroic, paternalistic doctor disin-\ntegrates\u201d (Atzeni/von Groddeck 2015: 33). Concepts and norms of the De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 175 \n \n Secondly, as the developing biomedicine based itself on scientific meth-\nods, it distanced itself from religion and even excluded it. A corresponding \ndevelopment can be observed in modern academic psychology, where \u201ctran-scendence was structurally excluded and the physical determinism of the \n1880s was adopted as an academic theory\u201d (Koch 2015: 436). \nThe approach to the body as matter and thus the exclusion of any meta-\nphysical, non-empirical aspects led to knowledge that claimed to be scientific \nbecause it was based on and restricted to the body as an empirical entity.\n20 \nMedicalization21 linked to rationalization (cp. Turner 2008; Ballard/El-\nston 2005) is compatible with secularization (cp. Bull 1990), of which it \nforms a part: for example, many \u201cconditions have become transformed from \nsin to crime to sickness\u201d (Conrad 1992: 213). Deviant social behavior, such as homosexual practices or epileptic seizures, and bodily dysfunctions like infertility, formerly understood in a religious framework, became medical-ized and were redefined as medical: \n \n\u201cDisapproved behavior is more and more coming to be given the meaning of illness \nrequiring treatment rather than of crime requiring punishment, victimization requiring compensation, or sin requiring patience and grace.\u201d (Freidson 1988: 248)  \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\u201cautonomous patient\u201d and the \u201cinformed patient\u201d became relevant and led to a \nchange in the general attitude towards patients.  \n20  It was common in the struggle for medical legitimization to declare one\u2019s own kind of medicine to be \u201cscientific\u201d instead of \u201creli gious\u201d. Therefore, one argument \nput forward by a medical editor in 1876, an advocate for medicine relying on clinical empiricism as opposed to medicine relying on laboratory experimenta-tion, was, for example: \u201cThe practitioner, at the bedside of his patien t does not \ncare to indulge in medical metaphysics. [...] In his attempts to solve mysteries, known only to the Infinite, the modern speculator makes bold assertions, not guar-anteed by a single fact, and with an audacity unparalleled, will no doubt shortly \ngive the medicinal effects of religion on the human soul, describing the essence \nof the vital spark, its chemical constituents, and a number of newly discovered elements contained therein.\u201d (cited in Cunningham/Williams 2002: 132).  \n21  Medicalization is a \u201c sociological concept, that essentially refers to the process by \nwhich social life comes to be seen through a medical framework\u201d (Howarth 2007: 119).  176 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens  \n Thirdly, the evolution of \u201cmedicine\u201d as a distinct social and academic system \nwas accompanied by increasingly successful attempts at the subordination and exclusion of practitioners who did not belong to the same academic sys-tem and did not share the same \u201cscientific\u201d rationale.\n22 While there has al-\nways been medical pluralism in the form of different kinds of healers, during the nineteenth century many new healing systems emerged, leading even more strongly to the formation of an \u201corthodox professional identity\u201d and a \u201crigid ideology of orthodoxy\u201d (Warner 1998: 5), as well as vice versa (Starr 1982: 95).\n23 This antagonism divided biomedicine from medical concepts \nand treatments that did not restrict themselves to the academic knowledge of \nthe natural sciences and did not necessarily exclude religion. With the \u201cpro-\nfession of medicine\u201d (Freidson 1988), the profession of medical doctors de-fined by a certain academic education, and the evolution of specialized pro-fessional institutions, (bio)medicine became an \u201cofficial social order\u201d (Freidson 1988: 303). According to Freidson, \u201c[...] it cannot fail that their [practicing professions\u2019] conceptions will be different from that of the man \non the street [\u2026]\u201d (1988: 303). This alienation of professional conceptions \nfrom the conceptions of patients is strongly interrelated with the \"clinical gaze\" described above. \nThe result of these three linked developments was the differentiation be-\ntween medicine as biomedicine, inseparably linked to the natural sciences\n24 \nand focus ed on immanent physical illness, on the one hand, and religion, \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n22  However, this was not a straightforward development without any setbacks. In \nthe pre -war period in the U SA, for example, \u201cthe power and prestige of the regular \nprofession were declining\u201d (Warner 1998: 6). Nevertheless, in this period many boundary structures evolved: the American Medical Association (AMA, founded 1847), for example, had as one of its goals to \u201cdraw the line of demarcation be-tween those who are of the profession and those who are not\u201d (cited in Warner 1998: 9).  \n23  The opposition was to medically exclusive \u201csystems\u201d that were \u201crationalist\u201d in-\nstead of \u201cempiricist\u201d in orientation, as especially h omeopathy was said to be \n(Warner 2003: 347).  \n24  This link does not hint at the de -differentiation between medicine and science, \nbut, in the language of systems theory, to its \u201csubsidiarity\u201d (Sch\u00fctzeichel 2011: \n86). Medical praxis, the practice of dealing w ith patients, should first of all be \naimed at their health, not at the acquisition of new scientific knowledge.

These systems have different functions for society and operate with different codes. As \nSch\u00fctzeichel (2011) observes, in modernity we move within the framework \nof different Sinnwelten , such as art, science, religion, or medicine. According \nto Sch\u00fctzeichel, we usually know in what kind of framework or Sinnwelt we are and \u201cwhich rules apply, where the boundaries of these rules are, and therefore where the boundaries of these areas are\u201d (2011: 73, my translation). Medicine in the shape of biomedicine is just one such \u201carea\u201d in the sense of \na functionally differentiated subsystem of society (Luhmann 1983, 1990: \n183\u2013187; Pelikan 2007, 2009: 42\u201343), and religion is another (cp. Luhmann 2002).\n26  \nWhile \u201c(bio)medicine\u201d operates with the code \u201csane/insane\u201d, \u201creligion\u201d \noperates with the code \u201ctranscendent/immanent,\u201d its function being to reduce contingency or eliminate it, at least temporarily. Luhmann assumed that re-\nligion will not be part of other functionally differentiated systems in modern \nsocieties. Correspondingly, we observe the \u201cseparating out of welfare [in-cluding medical care] as a distinct area of activity [\u2026] central to the process of secularization in European societies [\u2026]\u201d (Davie 2013: 225). This sepa-ration went along with professionalized agents and the creation of an auton-omous sphere with institutions organized by scientific instead of religious \nlogics, norms, and structures. According to Casanova, \u201cdifferentiation and \nemancipation of the secular spheres from religious institutions and norms \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n25  Starr mentions the different moral and religious as well as naturalistic American \nresponses to the cholera epidemics of the nineteenth centur y: \u201cDuring a second \nepidemic in 1849, clerical attacks on science were common, but religious author-ity no longer figured prominently in response to a third cholera epidemic in 1866. By then, public health methods and organizations were assuming more effect ive \nauthority.\u201d (1982: 36)  \n26  As Peter Beyer pointed out, under modern circumstances religion, as a functi on-\nally systemic form, acquired \u201cessential s ymptoms of such systematization\u201d: \u201c con-\nvergent centres of religious authority, expressly religious organizat ions (many \nwith global extent or at least more than local range), articulated religious pro-grammes elaborating clear religious binary codes, and the effective (self -)obser-\nvation of these inst itutions explicitly as religion\u201d  (1997: 222).  178 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens  \n remains a modern structural trend\u201d (1994: 212). Religion is still present in \nmedical institutions, especially in the field of dying and death, but medical and religious care have been separated: medical staff are responsible for the body, while chaplains are responsible for the soul. According to the World \nHealth Organization, \u201cspirituality\u201d (not \u201creligion\u201d!)\n27 should be an integral \npart of palliative care, and many manuals of various palliative care units de-\nmand that medical staff provide spiritual as well as medical support. But these agents are not expected to do both at the same time within the same interaction. All this fits into the framework of social \u201cdifferentiation,\u201d where different social subsystems are responsible for physical health on the one \nhand and religious well-being on the other. The process of medicalization \nand the exclusive focus on physical health in biomedical contexts are more sophisticated with regard to psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine. Psychi-atrists might feel responsible for the religious well-being of their patients in so far as they may discuss feelings of religious guilt or the fear of hell, but conventional psychiatrists will discuss these matters within a psychiatric \nframework: their focus is on the health status of their patients, not their trans-\ncendent salvation. \n \n  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n27  \u201cPalliative care  is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and \ntheir families facing the problem associated with life -threatening illness, through \nthe prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impec-\ncable assessment and trea tment of pain and other problems, physical, psychoso-\ncial and spiritual.\u201d (http://www.who.int/cancer/palliative -/definition/en/, June 14, \n2018).  De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 179 \n \n 4  THE CAM TOOL KIT  \n \nIn the following, I will suggest explanations for why, in a modern differenti-\nated society, processes take place that may be understood as part of a de-\ndifferentiation of medicine and religion. In particular, I will focus on the \nquestion of why CAM is attractive in certain medical contexts. This question was inspired by the observation in our case studies that many nurses, thera-pists, and patients in biomedical institutions used practices that belong to the field of CAM, such as aromatherapy, aura-healing, polarity, breath therapy \netc.  \nI will argue that CAM is attractive because it does not differentiate be-\ntween medicine and religion, because internally it is a \u201cloosely coupled field\u201d \nin the sense of Weick (1976), and because it offers a resource for self- em-\npowerment. The first trait, I argue further, is especially important and rele-vant for the other traits. Therefore, I will concentrate on it more broadly. \nThese arguments have been developed on the basis of various case studies of \nalternative medicine in Europe and the US, in combination with theoretical reflections on contemporary religiosity and religion. They are substantiated by observations and interview data from our own research project. \n \n4.1  CAM as an Undifferentiated Tool Kit  \n \nGrace Davie and Terhi Utriainen have already used the term \u201cde-differenti-ation\u201d with regard to processes in the field of health care in Britain and Fin-land respectively. Davie (2013: 233) called European developments, espe-cially in Britain, \u201cde-differentiation,\u201d where religious agents\u2014the churches \namong others\u2014are meant to provide a system of welfare, while the state re-\ntreats at least partly. Utriainen observed \u201cde-differentiation\u201d with regard to \u201cspiritual care,\u201d which she distinguished from Christian pastoral care. She refers to the entering of \u201cspiritual care\u201d in secular institutions and the lan-guage of care \u201cbecoming increasingly indeterminate and boundless\u201d (Utriainen 2010: 446). She further suggests that \u201cspiritual care is becoming \npart of the language and, perhaps increasingly, part of the practice of care, \n[which] will be understandable when it is seen in its historical context and conceptualized as de-differentation\u201d (Utriainen 2010: 447). While Davie and Utriainen discussed the de-differentiation of medicine and religion without referring to CAM, Buss and Sch\u00f6ps see the recognition of naturopathy as an 180 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens  \n example of de-differentiation phenomena. However, they do not explicitly \ndiscuss this topic with regard to religion (Buss and Sch\u00f6ps 1979: 327). Schlieter suggests to see Kabat-Zinn s MBSR in clinical settings as an exam-ple of \u201cdedifferentiation in biomedicine\u201d and argues that \u201cwe may des cribe \n\u2018dedifferentiation\u2019 more precisely as a process in which two independent sys-tems interact in a shared interface [...]\u201d (2017: 457). It is one argument of this article that the CAM tool kit is used because it is undifferentiated with regard to medicine and religion. \nI suggest using the concept of de-differentiation not only where we find \nthe same actors practicing medicine and religion, but also where practices \nare intended to have religious as well as medical effects and aims at the same \ntime. In other words, I suggest using the concept of de-differentiation where communication deals simultaneously with the differentiation between sane/insane and transcendent/immanent (Luhmann 1989: 313\u2013316). In the cases described in this paper, therefore, (immanent) medical situations and practices are observed under the perspective of transcendence. \nThus, the CAM tool kit does not reproduce the social differentiation be-\ntween medicine and religion that took place with regard to biomedicine. As I will show below, its strength lies in opposing the developments sketched out above. \nThe advocates of the unorthodox healing systems of the nineteenth cen-\ntury distanced themselves from what they called \u201callopathy\u201d or later \n\u201cSchulmedizin\u201d (J\u00fctte 1996: 23\u201335). While the German pathologist Rudolph \nVirchow, for example, used the label \u201cmedical science\u201d for the kind of med-icine that was mainly taught in the universities and stressed the orientation toward the natural sciences, opponents put \u201cnature\u201d in opposition to the \u201cnat-ural sciences.\u201d Accordingly, they blamed allopathy for not being oriented towards  nature and even for working against nature and against patients\u2019 \nbodies by means of its barbaric practices. To contrast the measures associated with \u201cheroic medicine,\u201d they claimed that their own therapies and remedies were smooth, \u201cnatural,\u201d and in harmony with nature. Catherine Albanese quotes part of the motto of two Thomsonian editors: \n \n\u201cNo poisoning, bleeding, blistering, or physicing\u2014no secret nostrums \u2014the unity of \ndisease, it bei ng an obstruction to the free op eration of the laws of vitality \u2014the use of \nthose remedies only, that act in harmony with nature\u2019s laws.\u201d  (1986: 492 \u2013493) \n \u2019De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 181 \n \n These healing systems, later summarized under the term \u201cCAM,\u201d did not ac-\ncept the \u201cclinical gaze\u201d and did not want to reduce the patient as a person to an object with a very specific illness related to specific aspects of her or his body.\n28 Many CAM practices and concepts claim to be \u201cholistic\u201d and to deal \nwith the person as a unity of \u201cbody, mind and soul/spirit\u201d.  \nWhile biomedicine differentiated itself from religion, CAM, at least in \nits holistic branches, integrated medicine with religion simultaneously.   4.1.1  CAM and Alternative Religion  \n \nThe integration of religion took place through the reception of alternative \nreligion that did not follow the process of becoming a functionally differen-tiated subsystem of society.\n29 In modern societies we witness religion ex-\npressing itself not only in a functional system and in social movements, as Beyer outlines, but in \u201cnon-systemic forms\u201d as well (Beyer 1997: 223). These \u201cnon-systemic forms\u201d are an \u201calternative for religion and its carriers \n[\u2026] to avoid functionally specific systemization, to avoid extensive organi-\nzation, orthodoxifications, and self-presentation as religion\u201d (Beyer 1997: 223). \nNew healing systems of the nineteenth century, such as homeopathy, \nThomsonianism, osteopathy, and hydropathy, were influenced by the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n28  Sered and Agigian call this a \u201cholist ic illness narrative\u201d  and explain that, while \nthe \u201cdiscursive expansion of illness intrinsic to the holism  of holistic healing may \nbe no less valid than conventional understandings of breast cancer,\u201d there are \n\u201chidden costs to the holistic illness narrative, just as there are hidden costs to the \nconventional medical narrative\u201d  (2008: 617).  \n29  Apparently, there is a striking parallel and link between \u201calternative/unorthodox\u201d and \u201cconventional/orthodox\u201d systems in the medical and religious fields. For ex-ample, William H. Holcombe (1804\u2013 1870), a North American adherent of Swe-\ndenborgianism and a prominent homoeopathic physician, saw a strong coherence \nbetween his religious and medical convictions and his opposition to \u201callopathy\u201d \nand orthodox theology: \u201cToday when speaking rather bitterly of Roman Catholic mummeries, my mind follow ing a familiar undercurrent of thought, I misnamed \nit Allopathic mummeries. The Old and New Medicine. Indeed, I am a Homeopath simply in primary view because I was previously a new Churchman\u201d (Holcombe as cited in Warner 1998: 8).  182 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens  \n alternative religions of their time: Swedenborgianism, mesmerism, spiritism, \ntranscendentalism, and magnetism. Accordingly, mind and body, material matter and spirit, nature and divine energy, were seen as intermingled and in correspondence with each other (Albanese 1986). Albanese described these \nconceptions, which \u201cdeified nature and made it into religion\u201d and where \u201cna-\nture became a symbolic and salvific center, encircled by a cluster of related therapeutic beliefs, behaviors, and values,\u201d by using the term \u201cnature reli-gion\u201d and linking it to the experiences of industrialization and urbanization (1986: 489). \nBeyer mentions as examples of contemporary \u201cnon-systemic forms\u201d \nNew Age movements, Western neo-paganism and Pentecostalism. All three of them are examples of religious expressions that show medical and thera-peutic aspects as well. Alternative religion, with its \u201cholistic\u201d self-under-standing, is deliberately capable of combining religious and medical prac-tices and \u201cavails itself of a range of bodily techniques, particularly healing techniques, meditation, yoga, Ayurveda [...]\u201d (Knoblauch 2008: 144). Beyer \nexplains that in the case of New Age, its eschewing \u201cconvergent systemati-\nzation\u201d means risking \u201cthe \u2018invisibility\u2019 of religion\u201d (Beyer 1997: 223).\n30 \nCorrespondingly, writing of the 1970s, John Gordon Melton observed that \u201cthe New Age Movement and the holistic health movement merged to the extent that it is difficult, if not impossible, for an observer to draw the line between them\u201d (1990: xix\u2013xx).  \nThe common semantics and conceptions of CAM and alternative religion \nstill involve, for example, \u201cenergy,\u201d \u201cthe \u2018correspondence\u2019 of the physical realm with higher metaphysical realms, enabling lawful patterns of interac-tion among them\u201d (Fuller 1989: 8), an \u201cinner transcendent self\u201d or subtle bodies (cp. Johnston 2010).\n31 Some authors therefore see CAM as a gateway \nto alternative religion (e.g. Knoblauch 2008: 144; Andritzky 1997). Accord-\ning to Koch, \u201c[...] \u2018spiritualization\u2019 in the sense of the adoption in society of \nelements linked to religion can [\u2026] be observed in the sector of alternative medicine\u201d (2015: 437). She observes further that, for example, \u201c[...] an \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n30  \u201cAll three of these [v arious religious manifestations like Western neo -paganism, \nNew Age movements, and ironically enough, Pentecostalism] eschew convergent \nsystematization in principle, if not actually in practice. This direction, however, risks precisely the \u2018invisibility\u2019  of religion [...]\u201d  (Beyer 1997: 223).  \n31  For a primary source, cp. Dale 2014.  De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 183 \n \n increasing number of \u2018Ayurvedas\u2019 have appeared since the 1990s, which of-\nten expressly describe themselves as spiritual or use religious concepts (cos-mological and anthropological concepts of happiness)\u201d (Koch 2015: 437). \nAll this indicates that alternative religion and CAM go hand in hand in \nmany cases. Aromatherapy, for example, is often perceived as a complemen-tary therapy, with its \u201cetheric qualities\u201d as therapeutics for the body, mind, and spirit that improve well-being physically, mentally, and emotionally, as well as \u201cspiritually.\u201d These effects are sometimes attributed to their influence on the limbic system. If a therapist wants to support a patient to connect with his or her \u201chigher self\u201d through an application of bergamot oil or to attract \nspiritual beings through the application of basil oil, there are obviously reli-\ngious aspects involved. In our case studies, neroli, lavender, and rose (dam-ascena and bulgarian) oil have been prominent. Beyond their physical and psychological effects, like \u201crelaxing\u201d and \u201ccalming,\u201d they are seen as \u201char-monizing,\u201d \u201cprotecting,\u201d \u201cenveloping,\u201d \u201cpurifying,\u201d and supporting transi-tions, all of them being effects that belong to a wider spiritual concept. Rose \noil especially is seen as supporting transitions. One nurse explained her usage \nof aromatherapy after being asked about any \u201cspiritual practices\u201d: \n \n\u201c[...] because it  [aromatherapy] is something that supports and comforts you. [...] For \ninstance, especially sli ghtly heavier scents like rose oil or lavender, um, (2) they help \n(.) people say, I don\u2019t know if and how this is scientifically proven (.)

This interview was conducted by Mirjam Mezger.  184 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens  \n These practices (including communicated concepts) quite often go beyond \nthe regulated practices suggested by the institutional manuals of secular health-care institutions. \nGiven the undifferentiated character of CAM, the question about the \nways in which the use of CAM is made attractive is raised . What are the \ngoals of using CAM in biomedical contexts? \nIn our case studies, nurses, therapists etc. often rely on CAM when they \nencounter limits with regard to the tools they are officially trained in. This is the case when nurses experience situations where they \u201ccannot do anything more for the dying patient,\u201d and a medical system restricted to biomedicine \ncan no longer work with its own references and logic of healing the physical \nbody. This experience is irritating, as medical staff see themselves as profes-sionals \u201chelping\u201d patients and having an empathic relationship with them. Therefore, they resort to CAM to develop strategies in order to keep in tune with their habitus, to be of help to their dying patients, and to maintain or enforce interaction with them: \n \n\u201cWe, the nurses, would like to have complementary medicine tools sometimes, so that \nyou are able to do something. Healing isn\u2019t possible anymore [at the palliative care \nunit], but at l east to be able to do something\u2014one has to be careful, whether one is \ndoing it for the patient or for oneself.33\u201d (Andrea, nurse, 17.6.2015)  \n \nThe CAM tool kit involves \u201csymbols, stories, rituals and world-views\u201d \n(Swidler 1986: 273), practices and concepts that go beyond the framework of the natural sciences. When nothing else can be done for the healing of the \nbody, support for emotional, metaphysical, and transcendent needs is an at-tractive strategy of action. CAM allows medical staff to rationalize their ac-tions and the ends they are pursuing with them beyond the boundaries of \nbiomedicine, framing them further as \u201csupportive.\u201d\n34 At the same time, this \ntool kit allows them to remain within the framework of \u201chealing\u201d and \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n33  Field note, Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens.  \n34  CAM al so enables actors in the religious field, such as chaplains, to deal with \nprecarious situations by targeting non -empirical as well as bodily levels. Thus, we \nfound carers who rationalized their practices with alternative religious concepts \nand used CAM, as  well as ecclesiastical ministers who completed complementary \nmedical training.  De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 185 \n \n \u201ccaring.\u201d The use of Aromtherapy by Regina mentioned above is an example \nof this: the aroma of rose oil is used to support the transition from life to death, the capacity of the patients to \u201clet go\u201d, an aim for which no biomedical tools are available. \n \n4.1.2  Religion as a Coping S trategy  \n CAM also offers a tool kit for agents who are generally interested in creating scopes of action that exceed the limits of their professions as defined and delimited by the differentiated subsystem we call \u201cmedicine\u201d. They attract \nactors in the medical field who do not want to restrict themselves to medical \npractices that focus only on the physical body but want to use religion, or rather \u201cspirituality,\u201d as part of coping strategies. This again seems to be es-pecially the case with palliative care, which today is strongly influenced by Cecily Saunders, a British Anglican social worker, nurse, and later physician, and Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross, a Swiss-American psychiatrist. One reason for \ntheir continuing, international influence is that they combine conventional \nhealth care with so-called \u201cspiritual care\u201d. As long as there is hope for heal-ing, the physical body is at the center of attention in secular hospitals. Social relationships, psychological aspects, and above all religion are only seen as supporting factors in the physical healing process. However, in institutions and hospital units specialized in palliative care, just the opposite can be ob-\nserved. The treatment of the body, in the sense of getting \u201csymptoms under \ncontrol,\u201d is seen as the condition for a process in which much more im-portance is attached to the idea of \u201ca good death,\u201d which involves mental and \n\u201cspiritual\u201d engagement with dying and death, including \u201cacceptance,\u201d \u201cpeacefulness,\u201d and \u201cthe decision to \u2018let go\u2019\u201d.\n35 \n \n\u201cThere seems to be a corresponding interest on the part of the patients, as several \nstudies hint at a \u2018value shift towards self- transcendent values in palliative care pa-\ntients, possibly reflecting coping processes which take place in the face of a terminal illness\u2019\u201d (Fegg et al. 2005: 158).  \n \nCAM, in connection with \u201cfluid New Age\u201d, often meets patients\u2019 need to \nunderstand their illnesses in broader contexts. It also allows them to discuss \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n35  Cp. Demj\u00e9n et al. 2016; Semino et al. 2014.  186 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens  \n themselves and their bodies. Patients can understand their sick bodies and \ntheir own \u201cspirituality\u201d as an integral part of their own selves. According to our case studies, the tool of breath therapy, for example, may enable patients to connect with suppressed, difficult emotions with the goal of \u201cletting them \ngo\u201d. This in turn may be seen as a path to their \u201chigher inner self\u201d. In the \nwords of one patient, \n \n\u201c[...] last but not least my illness alerted me, to tell me, hey, do something, in your \nsecond life\u201d (Elsbeth, patient, 8.6.2015).36  \n \nAccording to one therapist, falling ill is often seen as a task or a \u201c\u2018chance\u2019 to \nhave to learn something that maybe I haven't learned in my last lives\u201d (Mara, eurythmy therapist, 11.5.2015).\n37 In a similar way, illness is perceived as a \n\u201cpath\u201d or task for personal \u201cdevelopment\u201d: \u201cThere is some reason for getting that [illness], however. And whether to develop myself, to, perhaps, become aware, this is who I am\u201d (Manuela, nurse, 22.5.2015).\n38 \nPhysical experiences in the context of treatments can be connected to the \ngoal of spiritual development. This allows patients, especially when faced with their imminent death, to act, to do something for themselves, even with-out any opportunities to do anything actively to improve their bodily condi-tions. In this context, one therapist explained:  \n \n\u201cOften it happens during the therapy that people [experience] a mini -enlightenment. \n[...] and from that something evolves.\u201d (Mara, eurythmy therapist, 11.5.2015)39 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n36  Original wording: \u201cUnd n\u00f6d z letscht (.) h\u00e4t mich d Chrankhet wieder emal druf \nufegstosse, [Ja] mir z s\u00e4ge, hey, mach doch \u00f6pp is [Ja] ( -) mit dinere zweite Bio-\ngraphie.\u201d This interview quote and the following ones stem from interviews con-\nducted by Barbara Zeugin.  \n37  Original wording: \u201cIch glaube [...] eine gewisse Krankheit ( -) kann [...] sagen, \ndass ich jetzt was LERnen muss, was  ich die letzten Leben vielleicht noch nicht \ngelernt habe.\u201d  \n38  Original wording: \u201cEs h\u00e4t ir (.) glich irgend en Grund, dass mer das \u00fcberchunt.

Therefore, against the backdrop of the process of differen-tiation outlined above, the increasing incidence of CAM treatments and \nCAM practitioners in secular medical institutions may be seen as signs of a \nprocess of de-differentiation (Tiryakian 1985, 1992; Buss/Sch\u00f6ps 1979: 324). De-differentiation might be seen as \u201cprocesses in which previously separate roles or organizations are fused to deal with a broader set of prob-lems.\u201d (Rueschemeyer 1977: 8). However, a \u201c\u2018de-differentiated role\u2019 does not return to the structurally prior level of development characterized by lack \nof specialization\u201d (Lipman-Blumen as cited in Tiryakian 1985: 121). The \nrole of the nurse or therapist may become de-differentiated in serving medi-cal and religious aims at the same time without a loss of medical specializa-tion.  \nThese phenomena appear mainly at the margins of the biomedical health-\ncare system in cases of palliative care, maternity wards, psychosomatic med-\nicine, psychiatry, and preventive medicine. Yet it is often at the margins that \nnew developments occur and this trend has already reached cancer treatment units in particular. Beyond institutional implementation, in our studies, nurses and therapists, as well as in some cases medical doctors, use CAM and explain their dealings with patients by referring to alternative religious concepts, such as extra-sensory perception. This presence of CAM in secular \nmedical institutions, going along with religious semantics, concepts, and norms, hints at processes of de-differentiation. \n \n4.2  An Internally Loosely Coupled F ield \n \nThe field of alternative medicines and therapies and of alternative religion is decentralized and has so far been institutionalized only weakly. In being \ncharacterized by weak and non-committal internal connections between dif-ferent agents, it can be called a loosely coupled field in the sense of Weick (1976). In contrast, in strongly institutionalized fields such as academic med-icine or academic theology, the connections between agents, institutions etc. \nare much closer and more determined. This means first that training pro-\ngrams are comparatively open, with low-threshold access: one does not need a special level of educational attainment to be admitted to Reiki training, for example. 188 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens  \n Secondly, being a loosely coupled field allows a semantic vagueness and \na high level of sensitivity to the environment. Semantic vagueness40 is highly \ncompatible with the diverse professional self-perceptions and world views of \nthe medical staff. The diversity and flexibility of the available concepts and \npractices enable selective reception with high degrees of accuracy and flexi-\nbility to form varying configurations to fit the respective actors and their sit-uational needs, as there are no authorities who can regulate access or the ap-plication of concepts and practices.  \nThirdly, this adaptability also applies to the relationship of alternative \nreligiosity to medicine and established religion: selectively, theological and \nespecially medical and scientific schemes are integrated into alternative re-\nligiosities and their therapeutic practices. Accordingly, we observe a \u201creflex-ive curing\u201d culture (Koch 2015: 437) that corresponds to the popularization of the discourse in ritual studies (cp. L\u00fcddeckens 2004) and \u201creflexive ritu-alization\u201d (cp. Stausberg 2004). In the case of the latter, elements of anthro-pological theories of ritual are integrated into popular discourses about ritual \n(re)inventions. In the case of CAM, for instance, biomedical research, con-\ncepts, semantics, and symbols are partly integrated, or else references are \nmade to science like quantum theory. CAM concepts involve, for example, nerve tracts, references to the chemical ingredients of remedies, biomedical diagnostics etc.\n41 These flexible and selective connections allow actors to \nframe CAM as \u201ccompatible\u201d with and \u201ccomplementary\u201d to their own bio-\nmedical professionalization.  \n \n4.3  A Resource for Self -Empowerment  \n \nIn 1988, in his afterword to his study of 1970, in which he writes about the \nchanged position of the patient since then, Freidson noted that \u201cwell-edu-\ncated middle-class women of childbearing age have become more inclined to challenge medical authority and to insist on playing a more active role in their own treatment\u201d (1988: 388). In fact, surveys show that the idea of hav-ing more autonomy is one of the crucial motives for patients turning to \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n40  Typical examples of this sem antic vagueness are terms like \u201cenergy\u201d, \u201cnature,\u201d \nand \u201cholistic\u201d. \n41  One example in the Japanese context is kanp \u014d medicine, Harasawa S., Miyoshi \nA., and Miwa (1998).  De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 189 \n \n CAM.42 Ahlin, who discusses several studies from Europe, Canada, and the \nUSA, concludes that \n \n\u201c[\u2026] most important among these [the appealing positive qualities of alternative ther-\napists] is the sense of responsibility that alternative therapy offers i ts clients. In con-\ntrast to conventional medicine, the client is not a passive receiver of healthcare but a \nself-governing actor with responsibility regarding his/her health, both today and in the \nfuture .\u201d (2015: 406)  \n \nCAM practices do not necessarily involve patients more actively, and the \nautonomy of patients in their relationships with their therapists is in fact not \nnecessarily greater than in a biomedical context. However, patients associate the use of CAM with their own control over their own health matters, and this image of CAM is decisive. Bishop, Yardley, and Lewith, in their article A systematic review of beliefs involved in the use of complementary and al-ternative medicine , concluded: \n \n\u201cThe evidence suggests that CAM users want to participate in t reatment decisions, are \nlikely to have active coping styles and might believe that they can control their health. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n42  One has to take into account the fact that the different studies rely on users of \ndifferent kinds of CAM and that some of them found different results for different practitioners (e.g. Reiki prac titioners may differ from homeopathy users). More-\nover, it makes a decisive difference whether one studies people who rely exclu-sively on CAM or people who combine CAM with biomedical treatments. Astin \nwas able to show that the \u201cdesire for control over heal th matters\u201d (1998: 1551) \nwas one of the independent variables among the significant predictors for relying \nprimarily on alternative forms of health care. Bishop, Yardley, and Lewith sug-gest that \u201cpeople who use CAM might be more likely to prefer an active or col-laborative role in treatment decisions than non -users\u201d (2007: 852). Similarly, \nPawluch outlined that \u201c[...] complementary therapies represented a way to make \na statement about the unresponsiveness and oppression of Western medicine. It \nrepresented a way to take control of one\u2019s health [...]\u201d (2000: 261). In contrast to a study published in 2003 by L\u00f6nroth and Ekholm, as reported by Ahlin (2015), the gender aspect is rarely considered. The latter found that 25% of patients, most of them women, had a \u201cw ish to take an active part in the healing process,\u201d an \nimportant factor in the use of CAM (Ahlin 2015: 407).  190 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens  \n They value non -toxic, holistic approaches to health and hold \u2018postmodern belief sys-\ntems\u2019 with viewing themselves as unconventional and spiritu al.\u201d (2007: 862)  \n \nMy argument here is that CAM is associated with more autonomy than con-\nventional biomedicine because it is perceibed, at least partly, as separate from \nthe hegemonic health system dominated by biomedicine (which is experi-enced as depriving patients of their autonomy) and as something the \u201ccultural authorities\u201d do not accept and that is therefore to some extent \u201csubversive.\u201d There is a congruence between these heirs of a \u201cmedical counter-culture\u201d (cp. Saks 2003) and contemporary spiritualities along the lines of a New Age \nspirituality (cp. Hanegraaff 2000), the heirs to a \u201creligious counter-culture\u201d. \nThe impression that CAM is being increasingly accepted by the mainstream population, and even by the medical authorities, health insurance companies and so on, is even more a confirmation that the \u201ctruth\u201d will prevail. \nNot only patients, but medical staff too may use CAM as a resource for \nself-empowerment and a tool for autonomy. As a loosely coupled field, CAM \noffers actors\u2014in our case health- care providers such as nurses and thera-\npists\u2014more self-determination and autonomy than fields with strong ties do (cp. Granovetter 1973; Weick 1976). The strict regulations in hospitals re-garding the practices of nurses are related to the fields of biomedicine and conventional nurseries: they do not include any rules regarding energy med-icine or aura healing. There is no constraining authority to control nurses in \nthese fields of CAM as long as they do not offend violently against the gen-\neral hospital regulations. Therefore, CAM provides a route to \u201cself-empow-erment\u201d for actors in the hierarchically organized medical field who see themselves as limited by their professions, as is often the case with nurses and therapists. The threshold for becoming an alternative therapist is consid-erably lower than the threshold to enter academic medicine. For a nurse seek-\ning a career change, it is much easier to become a \u201cpolarity therapist\u201d than to \nembark on medical studies.\n43 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n43  People who follow a de -differentiating course of action publicly and explicitly \nlose their status in their original field: Cicely Saunders, who is immensely im-\nportant for \u201cspiritual care\u201d and integrates medical and religious practices and ends, no longer has a strong standing as an academic theologian. Elisabeth K\u00fcbler -Ross, originally a doctor, also made de -differentiating moves by conceiv-\ning death in a way that is no longer accepted within academic medicine. Her ideas De-differentiation of Religion and Medicine: CAM | 191 \n \n CAM offers a way to enhance self-esteem and prestige in the eyes of \npatients and sometimes colleagues as well. As Homi Bhabha observed of \nagents with less hierarchical power: \n \n\u201c[...] there exist possibilities to reverse the cultural authorities we\u2019re facing, to adopt \nsome aspects of it, and dismiss others . This leads to a hybridisation of the symbols of \nauthority and turned into something of its own. Hybridisation to me does not simply \nmean mixing, but rather a strategic and selective appropriation of meaning, the crea-tion of space for agents whose freedom  and equality is threatened.\u201d\n44 (Bhabha cited \nin Babka/Posselt 2012: 13)  \n \nCAM offers a \u201cselective appropriation of meaning\u201d that one may call a re-\nflexive or hybrid curative culture (cp. L\u00fcddeckens 2013). By integrating the metaphysical or transcendent aspects into medical care, CAM provides agents with the power to claim care beyond what is conventional and physi-cal. The medical system makes this kind of self-empowerment possible, es-\npecially in palliative care. Where conventional medical reason has reached \nits limits, healing is no longer possible, and no more or at least less medical damage seems possible: thus, the field can be opened to alternative practices and interpretations. \n \n  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \nare regarded as esoteric precisely because they integrate the religious and medical \nperspectives.  \n44  Original wording: \u201c[...] es [gibt] M\u00f6glichkeiten, die auferlegten kulturellen Au to-\nrit\u00e4ten umzudrehen, einiges davon anzunehmen, anderes abzulehnen. Dadurch werden die Symbole der Autorit\u00e4t hybridisiert und etwas Eigenes daraus gemacht. Hybridisierung hei\u00dft f\u00fcr mich nicht einfach Vermischen, sondern strategische und selektive Aneignung  von Bedeutungen, Raum schaffen f\u00fcr Handelnde, deren \nFreiheit  und  Gleichheit  gef\u00e4hrdet  sind.\u201d  http://sciencev1.orf.at/sci ence/news/14\n988, June 21,  2018.  9192 | Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens  \n 5  CONCLUSION  \n \nWe are witnessing the growing institutionalization of CAM in secular medi-\ncal institutions in Switzerland, as in many other European countries. In pal-\nliative care units, the CAM tool kit is used when the differentiated \u201c(bio)med-icine\u201d sub-system reaches the limits of its inherent logic. In cases where \u201cnothing can be done anymore\u201d with regard to the physical health of patients, medical staff face challenges to their professional habitus as care-givers. \nI have argued that CAM is currently successful in European countries \nbecause of three characteristics it has. By responding to medical as well as religious or spiritual needs, and also by integrating aspects of alternative re-ligion, CAM allows medical staff to serve not only the bodily but also the emotional, metaphysical, and transcendent needs of their patients. Thus, by using the CAM tool kit, medical staff are able to preserve their habitus as care-givers even at the end of life when nothing or less can be done for the \nwell-being of their patients\u2019 physical bodies. As a loosely coupled field, \nCAM offers low-threshold access to training and application. It also serves \nas a resource of self-empowerment for patients and medical staff alike in relation to conventional biomedicine and its hierarchical structures. \nThe relevance of action strategies that refer to the CAM tool kit is grow-\ning in secular, biomedicine-oriented institutions in Switzerland. Comple-\nmenting other cases from England and Scandinavia, I suggest that this in-\ncrease may be understood as a process of the de-differentiation of medicine and religion in modern, European societies.   \nBIBLIOGRAPHY  \n Ahlin, Lars (2015): \u201cThe Growth of Alternative Therapy: A Valid Argument \nagainst the Secularisation Thesis?\u201d, in: Journal of Contemporary Reli-gion 30(3), pp. 399\u2013413. \nAlbanese, Catherine (1986): \u201cPhysic and Metaphysic in Nineteenth-Century \nAmerica: Medical Sectarians and Religious Healing\u201d, in: Church His-tory: Studies in Christianity and Culture 55(4), pp. 489\u2013502. \nAndritzky, Walter (1997): Alternative Gesundheitskultur: Eine Bestandsauf-\nnahme mit Teilnehmerbefragung, Berlin: VWB- Verlag .

From a practice -theoretical perspective, the paper \ndiscusses the interferences of medicine, religion, and spirituality in the fie ld of \nanthroposophical end -of-life care. It describes the main practices conducted \nthroughout the different stages of end -of-life care in this hospital and relates them to \ntheir rationalizations by medical actors as well as to basic anthroposophical concepts. \nBesides, the authors analyze power struggles between different actors displaying \nvarious dispositions concerning conventional and anthroposophical medicine, the latter integrating religious and spiritual aspects. The paper concludes by arguing that \n(1) there is a shift of relevance with regard to body -oriented and discursive practices \nin the course of anthroposophical end -of-life care, with a stronger emphasis on body -\noriented practices at later stages. Moreover, (2) body -oriented practices, if rational ized \nin a religious way, serve as a resource not only for patients, but for staff members, \ntoo. Finally, (3) the contested issue of administering pain -killers and sedatives at the \nend of life in this hospital revealed that in many cases, nurses, despite their inferior \nposition compared to physicians, succeeded in their wish to act in discordance with \nanthroposophical principles.  \n 202 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n 1  INTRODUCTION1 \n \nIn 2012, the Swiss people voted in favor of a popular petition to integrate \nanthroposophic2 medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, neu-\nral therapy, and herbal medicine into the official list of services covered by \nobligatory health insurance. As a consequence, all expenses for these types of treatment will henceforth be covered, if they are provided or prescribed by trained physicians. This indicates a growing social acceptance of Com-plementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)\n3 in Switzerland as part of the \nestablished health-care system.4 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1  All the empirical data on anthroposophical end-of-life care used in this article \ncome from a case s tudy conducted by Barbara Zeugin within the broader context \nof a research project on Alternative Religiosity and its Consequences at the End \nof Life funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation ( cp. www.nfp67.ch/  \nen/projects/module-4- cultural -concepts -social -ideals/project -lueddeckens , July \n4, 2018 ). We would like to convey our special thanks to all the managerial staff \nin the hospital where Zeugi n conducted her fieldwork, to the leading internist, \nwho introduced and mentored her, and to all employees and patients who wel-\ncomed her with open arms. Without their willingness to share their thoughts and \nexperiences with her, this fieldwork would not ha ve been possible. The research \nproject was approved by the Kantonale Ethikkommission Z\u00fcrich. Aside from the relevant literature, the few remarks in this article on conventional palliative care are based on Dorothea L\u00fcddecken\u2019s fieldwork in a Swiss conventi onal palliative \ncare unit conducted in 2016.\n \n2  We decided to use the term \u201canthroposophic  medicine\u201d  instead of \u201c anthroposoph-\nical medicine\u201d  so as to acknowledge the most common emic language usage, in \nline with Kienle et al. (2006) .  \n3  Gale and McHale\u2019s c ollection (2015) gives an overview of CAM, J\u00fctte (1996) \nintroduces the history of CAM, and Crawford (2003) discusses terminological issues.  \n4  The website of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health provides information about all policies related to the i ncorporation of CAM into the public health sector  \n(cp. www.bag.admin.ch/themen/gesundheitspolitik/03153/index.html?lang =de, \nJuly 4, 2018).  Puustinen (2014) has criticiz ed the incorporation of anthroposoph-\nical medicine into the Swiss health -care sector by claiming that its religious ori-\nentation is incompatible with the  principles of natural science.  Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland | 203 \n \n Alongside these developments, the social sciences are also showing an \nincreasing interest in CAM. Social scientists are either examining particular \nexamples of CAM or else discussing its relationship to conventional medi-cine ( cp. Jeserich 2010). Scholars in the Study of Religion, on the other hand, \ntend to scrutinize relationships between religion and medicine by referring mostly to discursive data material, that is, to written and oral data. Most of these studies discuss particular healing practices such as Ayurveda (cp. Koch \n2006a, 2006b; Koch/Binder 2013; L\u00fcddeckens 2018) or address the issue more generally (cp. Brown 2013; Koch 2015; L\u00fcddeckens 2012, 2013). The latter approach often leads to the conclusion that, while CAM stems from \nspecific religious traditions, it also forms an interface between religion and \nmedicine. While this article agrees with this conclusion, it differs methodo-logically from these earlier studies, which restrict their analyses to the level of conceptualization by using only discursive data. Instead, this article at-tends not only to what people say but also to what they do, that is, to how they act.\n5 Thus, the central focus is on the social practice of anthroposophical \nend-of-life care using one particular anthroposophical hospital as a case study.\n6 \nAdopting a practice-theoretical perspective on religion has proved to be \na promising endeavor in recent research in the Study of Religion (cp. Echt-ler/Ukah 2016a; Utriainen 2013; Walthert 2014; Wood 2007; Wright/Rawls 2005). Within practice theory, Bourdieu\u2019s terms and concepts are quite \nprominent and allow not only varied sets of actions to be differentiated as \nspecific to a certain group of people (habitus), but also their attribution to a specific realm (social field). Whereas scholars have already worked on the religious field (cp. Bourdieu 2000; Echtler/Ukah 2016b), this article deals with the intersection between it and the medical field. \nThis specific focus is due to the fact that anthroposophical end-of- life \ncare unfolds in a particular historical, social, and institutional context that already indicates a position between (alternative) religion\n7 and (convent-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n5  Cp. Mezger 2018.  \n6  A communication -theoretical approach may represent  another way of escaping a \nconceptualizing view of CAM (cp. Zeugin 2017).  \n7  The term \u201calternative religion\u201d is used in this paper as an etic category. In general , \npractitioners of anthroposophic medicine do not consider themselves to belong to 204 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n ional) medicine8. The practice of anthroposophical end-of- life care  combines \nthe basic principles of conventional medicine with alternative religious be-\nliefs and practices, as anthroposophic medicine has aimed to counter-balance the one-sided notion of conventional medicine since its beginnings:  \n \n\u201cThis is not an opposition against contemporary medicine working with scientifically \nacknowledged methods. We fully accept this medicine in her princi ples. And in our \nopinion what we offer should only be used by that practitioner of the art of medicine who can be considered a full physician according to these principles.\u201d (Stei-ner/Wegman 2014: 7)\n9 \n \nAnthroposophic medicine claims to undo the mechanistic and fragmentary \nconceptions of human beings that allegedly exist in contemporary conven-tional medicine by re-integrating \u201cspiritual science\u201d (\u201cGeisteswissenschaft\u201d in German) into medical practice. Steiner frequently used \u201cGeisteswissen-schaft\u201d as a synonym of anthroposophy to highlight the aspect of spiritual \nscience that goes along with the anthroposophical worldview. In this sense, \n\u201cGeisteswissenschaft\u201d means the aim and claim to describe \u201cdas Geistige\u201d, \u201cthe spiritual,\u201d exactly and methodically.\n10 \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \nthe realm o f religion, nor to alternative religion. From an emic perspective, an-\nthroposophy is seen at most as \u201c spiritual\u201d.  \n8  We use \u201cconventional medicine\u201d in this paper as an etic category. German texts \nwritten by anthroposophical authors mainly use the term \u201cSchu lmedizin\u201d or just \n\u201cMedizin.\u201d Kienle, Kiene and Albonico use the term \u201cscientific medicine\u201d, and \nremark that \u201cAnthroposophic medicine considers itself to be an extension of sci-entific medicine\u201d ( 2006: 4).\n \n9  This translation and all following translations o f texts originally in German are \nmade by the authors of this article.  \n10  The English version of the official website of the \u201cSchool of science \u201d of the An-\nthroposophical Society at the Goetheanum explains: \u201c In 1924 Rudolf Steiner de-\nveloped a course of study based on meditative exercises that lead \u2018the spiritual in \nthe human being to the spiritual in the universe.\u2019 This is the basis for the work of the School of Spiritual Science. It is also the background of the research, teaching, and training activities of the General Anthroposophical Section \u201d (https : \n//www.goetheanum.org/en/school- of-spiritual -science, March 8, 2018).   | 205 \n \n According to the subtitle of Steiner and Wegman\u2019s Grundlegendes f\u00fcr \neine Erweiterung der Heilkunst nach geisteswissenschaftlichen Erkenntnis-\nsen (1977), their motive for founding anthroposophic medicine consisted in \nthe desire to extend the art of healing through spiritual knowledge (\u201cErwei-\nterung der Heilkunst nach geisteswissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen\u201d). Thus, \ncombining conventional medicine with anthroposophy and thus with alter-native religious beliefs and practices was intended from the outset. \nFrom the perspective of the Study of Religion, anthroposophy can be cat-\negorized as a form of alternative religiosity, that is, as a contemporary reli-\ngious phenomenon that in some ways represents an alternative to mainstream \nreligions.\n The attribution of these forms of religion as alternatives points to \nthe fact that alternative religions draw on sources that do not form part of the \ndominant canons of religious belief and practice (Knoblauch 2009: 104). Moreover, by referring to religiosity, the emphasis lies on individual rather than institutional forms of religion (cp. Luckmann 2005). In recent decades, alternative religious beliefs and practices have been widely diffused through-\nout society, with medicine and CAM leading the way (cp. L\u00fcddeckens/Wal-\nthert 2010a, 2010b). Hence, the attribution of these forms of religion as \u201cal-ternative\u201d is increasingly losing its legitimacy. However, in contrast to other\n \nterms, it still has important advantages: unlike the terms \u201cagnostic,\u201d \u201cfuzzy,\u201d \u201cpopular religion\u201d or \u201cspirituality,\u201d \u201calternative\u201d provides information about a form of religiosity's current position in the religious field. \nThe narrative of re-integrating \u201cspiritual science,\u201d and therefore from an \netic point of view (alternative) religion, into medicine is only plausible when the respective fields have already been subjected to processes of differentia-tion, as is true of conventional medicine and of caring for the terminally ill.\n11 \nThe continuing differentiation between religious and medical actors was strongly criticized (Kellehear 2007: 157), and, as a result, the conventional \nmedical paradigm of palliative care developed as a counter-balance to the \nmedicalization of dying and death (Walter 1994: 12\u201313). From its very be-ginning, (conventional) palliative care was not only informed by conven-tional medical care, it also included religion and spirituality (\u201cspiritual care\u201d) in its treatment of the terminally ill and dying. This multidisciplinary ap-proach to palliative care is often traced to Cicely Saunders and the hospice \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n11  L\u00fcddeckens (this volume) examines the interrelatedness of CAM with religion \nand medicine using the concept of de- differentiation.  Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland206 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n movement (cp. Clark 2001; Wright/Clark 2012). In one of her lectures at \nYale University in 1963, Saunders suggested introducing palliative care as a form of holistic care that involves the treatment of \u201cphysical, spiritual, and psychological discomfort\u201d alike (Lutz 2011: 305).\n12 By not simply delegat-\ning religious and/or spiritual care to actors within the established churches, concepts of palliative care hold everyone liable for caring for patients\u2019 r eli-\ngious and/or spiritual needs and they quite often make room for alternative religious practices and rationalizations. \n  \n2  THE ANTHROPOSOPHICAL  MEDICAL SETTING  \n \nThere is a broad range of academic publications about contemporary anthro-posophic medicine from an insider\u2019s perspective. For example, Kienle et al. (2013) provide a general overview of anthroposophic medicine. In addition, \nthere are more general publications by anthroposophical physicians, nurses, \nand therapists (cp. Bopp/Heine 2008; Fintelmann 2007; Kienle et al. 2006; Girke 2012; Gl\u00f6ckler 2010; Heusser 2011), as well as research articles on different methods of anthroposophic medicine (e.g., on the effectiveness of mistletoe therapy with cancer patients).\n13 Heusser et al. (2006a, 2006b), von \nDach (2001), and von Dach et al. (2009) focus specifically on end-of- life \ncare. For accounts of the history of anthroposophic medicine, its origins and sources from an anthroposophical perspective, in particular the publications of the Ita Wegman Institute and of Peter Selg (2000a; 2000b), the head of the Ita Wegman Institute ( http://www.wegmaninstitut.ch/, July 4, 2018) should \nbe consulted.\n14 There are only a few academic accounts from an outsider\u2019s \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n12  One o utcome of this conceptualization is the official definition of the World \nHealth Organization : \u201cPalliative care is an approach that improves the quality of \nlife of patients and their families facing the problem associated with life -threat-\nening illness, thro ugh the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early \nidentification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other prob-\nlems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual \u201d.(www.who .int/cancer/palliative/  \ndefinition/en, July 4, 2018)  \n13  A list of other English publications is to be found on the webpage of the medical section of the Goetheanum : www.medsektion -goetheanum.org/en/home/books.  \n14  Cp.

Apart from book chapters on the history of anthroposophic med-\nicine (Br\u00fcgge 1984: 101\u2013125; J\u00fctte 1996: 237\u2013261; Ullrich 2011: 158\u2013165, Zander 2007: 1455\u20131578), scholarly discussions lack contemporary research on anthroposophic medicine from an etic point of view, although there are a \nfew exceptions (Arman et al. 2008; Karschuck 2018; Ritchie 2001; \nZeugin/Walthert 2016). To our knowledge, apart from Arman et al. (2008), \nwho conducted qualitative interviews in a Swedish clinic, no qualitative study from a social scientific or Study of Religion perspective has ever been conducted in an anthroposophical hospital.\n15 \nAnthroposophic medicine16 was founded by the physician Ita Wegman \n(1876\u20131943) and Rudolf Steiner (1861\u20131925).17 Even though Steiner had al-\nready shown an interest in medical subjects in the first decades of the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n15  Ritchie (2001) provides a qualitative study of the National Centre for Social Re-\nsearch, an independent social research institution. The study was funded by the \nAnthroposophic Medical Trust and printed by Weleda. In this study, which adopts an etic perspective, the aut hors investigate six practices and one residential unit \nin GB that offer anthroposophic al treatment in addition to general practice. By \nmeans of interviews with patients and medical staff, as well as an analysis of \nmedical records, the authors address the questions of how anthroposophic al treat-\nment is perceived by medical staff working in general practice, how it is organized \nand delivered, and what impact it has on patients in terms of patient responses and clinical effects ( ibid: 4). \n16  The following para graphs are based on emic sources, exemplary monographs that \nfall entirely within the contemporary field of anthroposophic medicine ( cp. \nGl\u00f6ckler  et al.  2011; Girke 2012), and the website of the medical section at the \nSchool of Spiritual Science, Goetheanum , in Dornach, Switzerland \n(www.medsektion -goetheanum.org/home/anthroposophische -medizin , July 4, \n2018). Even though the field of anthroposophic medicine is indeed heterogen e-\nous, these self -portraits should be considered accurate, despite the difference in \nactors.

Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland208 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n twentieth century, the founding date is often located in the early 1920s, a \ndecade that witnessed three events that had a lasting impact on anthropo-sophic medicine. First, Wegman and Steiner held medical courses for medi-cal practitioners in Dornach, Switzerland (the centre of anthroposophy).\n18 \nSecondly, Wegman founded the first anthroposophic hospital in Arlesheim, Switzerland, where medical research has been conducted ever since. Thirdly, in 1925, Wegman published the first monograph on anthroposophic medi-cine, written by herself and Steiner (Steiner/Wegman 1977).\n19 \nAs mentioned above, Steiner and Wegman did not view anthroposophic \nmedicine as being opposed to conventional medicine; rather, they conceptu-\nalized it as being in accordance with academic medical science and thus as \nan extension of conventional medicine, which anthroposophy comple-mented. Therefore, anthroposophic medicine is combined with conventional medical practices, each with their own rationalizations. This is why many anthroposophical medical actors favor the paradigmatic term \u201cintegrative medicine\u201d (Gl\u00f6ckler et al. 2011: 564\u2013567). While Steiner, Wegman, and oth-\ners created new anthroposophical medical practices (e.g., rhythmic massage), \nthey also adapted existing such practices to the medical setting (e.g., eu-rythmy therapy).\n20 Since its beginnings, anthroposophic medicine has cared \nfor the terminally ill, but it was not until recently that the conception of an-throposophical end-of-life care has emerged and received expression (cp. Girke 2012: 1051\u20131083; www.sterben.ch). \nWithin anthroposophic medicine, human beings are viewed as multi-lay-\nered. In his early works, Steiner mainly referred to an anthropology that con-sisted of seven bodies (2010: 19\u201336) and that goes back to theosophy. In the 1920s he started to elaborate an anthropology featuring four bodies (Zander 2007: 1495\u20131497). In this view, the human being consists of a fourfold body, \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n18  https ://www.goetheanum.org/en/, July 4, 2018.  \n19  This publication has now been translated online as \u201cFundamentals of Therapy : \nAn Extension of the Art of Heal ing through Spiritual Knowledge \u201d (cp.  \nhttp://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA027/E nglish/RSP1983/GA027_index.html, \nJuly 4, 2018).  \n20  Even though all these proprietary anthroposophic medical practices were more or \nless informed by anthroposophy, anthroposophy is not their only source. Some \nresearchers, for example, have examined the connection between anthroposop hic \nmedicine and homeopathy ( J\u00fctte 1996 : 237\u2013261; Zander 2007: 1514 \u20131522).   | 209 \n \n the physical body (shape, anatomy, organs, and all the other material as-\npects), the etheric body (the source of life and growth that endows us with thinking skills), the astral body (the carrier of consciousness and feelings), and the I-organization or higher self. The fourth body constitutes the individ-\nuality of the person or his or her spirit, which ultimately transcends li fe (Stei-\nner/Wegman 1977: 7\u201319). This conception of the human being is linked to a \nspecific conception of the afterlife, as the I-organization or higher self will not only outlast death, it will be reincarnated (Steiner 2010: 37 \u201359). \nSteiner\u2019s notion of the four bodies is closely related to the concept of the \nthreefold nature of the human organism that distinguishes the nerve- sense \nsystem, the metabolic-limb system, and the rhythmic system. An anthropo-sophical medical article advocating the need for \u201crhythm studies\u201d (Hilde-\nbrandt 1997) illustrates the close link between the models of the threefold nature and the fourfold (or sevenfold) body, as well as their foundation in religious concepts. In Steiner\u2019s own words:  \n \n\u201cThe rhythmic element in the four bodies [a spects of the human being] was implanted \nin man over long, long periods.... And we would recognize the rhythm of our human \naspects in the movements of the heavenly bodies, which make a complete system.\u201d (20 July 1923, Dornach)  \n \n\u201cOne day man will also apply his own rhythm to the world, when he has reached the \ndivine level.\u201d (21 Dec. 1908, Berlin)21 \n \n \n3  PRACTICE THEORY: MET HODOLOGY, METHODS, \nAND DATA  \n \n3.1  A Practice -Theoretical Approach  \n \nAccording to a practice-theoretical approach, the social is only accessible when it is carried out in action. This is in line with Theodore R. Schatzki\u2019s definition of social practices as a \u201ctemporally unfolding and spatially \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n21  The second quotation by Rudolf Steiner appears in his lecture \u201c\u00dcber den \nRhyt hmus der menschlichen Leiber\u201d, 1988: 158.  Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland210 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n dispersed nexus of doings and sayings. [\u2026] To say that the doings and say-\nings forming a practice constitute a nexus is to say that they are linked in certain ways\u201d  (1996: 89). Thus, social practices are constituted by the per-\nformance of doings and sayings and the existence of a coherent system of \nknowledge about the links between these doings and sayings. Accordingly, \nthey can be heuristically distinguished in terms of a) their use of language and b) their knowledge structures:  \na) Social practices that exhibit a high use of language might be labeled \ndiscursive practices in so far as they \u201c[...] embrace different forms in which the world is meaningfully constructed in language or in other sign- systems\u201d \n(Reckwitz 2002: 254). Social practices do not necessarily have to involve language or other sign systems and might thus be labeled  body practices, or \nnon-discursive practices. However, a closer look at social reality reveals that social practices are only rarely either solely discursive or non-discursive. Ra-ther, they exhibit a greater or lesser orientation towards language or the body, being either more communication/language- (and less body-) oriented or \nmore body- (and less communication/language-) oriented. \nb) Social practices often build on the ability of actors to rationalize their \nactions reflexively. What Giddens calls the rationalization of action means \nthat \u201cactors\u2014also routinely and for the most part without fuss\u2014maintain a \ncontinuing \u2018theoretical understanding\u2019 of the grounds of their activity\u201d (1984: 5). This form of knowledge is the most common one, yet it is often \nnot \u201cdirectly accessible to the consciousness of actors\u201d (Giddens 1984: 4). \nAlthough, as social scientists, we examine this knowledge either through ob-servation or by explicitly enquiring about it, the implicit motivation of action is not discursively accessible (Giddens 1984: 6, but constitutes the \u201cimplicit sense of what someone actually wants\u201d (Reckwitz 2003: 293). \n \n3.2  Data and Data Collection  \n Adopting a practice-theoretical view of anthroposophic medicine has an im-pact on one\u2019s methodological approach: this qualitative study first looked at what is happening on the ground and then asked the actors to rationalize their  | 211 \n \n doings and sayings discursively.22 Accordingly, this study combined the \nqualitative research methods of participant observation23 and qualitative in-\nterviews.24 Given that our main interest was in anthroposophic end-of- life \ncare, the fieldwork focused on those hospital units that exhibited dying and \ndeath as crucial features, namely an oncological ambulatory and an oncology \nward.  \nZeugin actively participated in the field by means of a nursing internship \nand the job-shadowing of physicians, nurses, and therapists alike. This pro-vided valuable insights into what happens behind closed doors (e.g., consul-tations between physicians and patients, appointments with therapists, an-\nthroposophical medical treatments). Apart from participant observation, she \nblended in by experiencing certain anthroposophical medical practices her-\nself, such as art therapy, rhythmic massage, poultices, and therapeutic eu-rythmy.\n25 In addition, she conducted 25 interviews of an average duration of \none hour with health professionals (nurses, physicians, therapists, social workers), pastors, and terminally ill and dying patients. Finally, she collected \ngrey literature, online information, and internal documents. \n \n3.3  An Anthroposophical Medical Hospital\n26 \n \nThe anthroposophical hospital in which the fieldwork was conducted opened \nin the 1990s as a private clinic primarily providing anthroposophical medical \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n22  Even though, following Bourdieu (2005 : 18\u201319), this is legitimate, we have to \npay attention to the fact that such rationalizations \u2014concepts, beliefs and values \u2014\nand their verbal manifestations in discourses might  not occur if it were not for us.  \n23  Apart from general guidelines about participant observation (cp. Spradley 1980; \nEmerson  et al. 2001; Franke/ Maske 2011), Zeugin considered the term \u201cfocused \nethnography\u201d coined by Hubert Knoblauch (2001, 2002, 2005) to be an important \nreference point.  \n24  In order to enhance the comparability of all the interviews, Zeugin designed a \nqualitative interview technique that combines elements of narrative interviews as \nconceived by Fritz Sch\u00fctze (1983) and elements of problem -centered interviews \nsuggested by Andreas Witzel (1985, 2000).  \n25  For a similar approach , cp. Langford 2002.  \n26  The following description is primarily based on the hospital\u2019s discursive self -por-\ntrayal in grey literature and on their website.  Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland212 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n treatment. In the late 1990s, the hospital was entered on the official list of \nhospitals, and since then it has been authorized and required to conduct pri-mary health care, as well as emergency medical aid, like any other public health facility. Whereas its conventional medical treatment has always been \ncovered by obligatory health insurance, formerly many anthroposophical \nmedical treatments had to be financed by the patients themselves or by sup-plementary insurance. Only very recently, and as a result of the official recognition of anthroposophic medicine in 2009, has the hospital managed to introduce a lump-sum payment for anthroposophical treatments on a case-by-case basis.\n27 Since then, the costs of anthroposophical medical practices \nhave been covered by basic health insurance, provided that they are pre-scribed  by a physician and are carried out for a patient on this financial basis. \nA support association funded by donations and guided by members of the \nAnthroposophical Society bears some of the additional expenses associated with the hospital\u2019s orientation towards anthroposophic medicine from day one. For example, the support association pays for the employment of an \nanthroposophical nursing expert, who is responsible for training nurses in \nanthroposophical nursing, as they usually only have conventional training. \n \n \n4  ANTHROPOSOPHICAL END -OF-LIFE CARE  \n \nAs end-of-life care embraces more than just one\u2019s death bed, it is conducted at various stages of both conventional (Jonen-Thielemann 2012: 989\u2013997\n) \nand anthroposophical end-of- life care. Corresponding to the anthroposophi-\ncal concept of the end of life and to practice in the respective hospital, the following stages also cover the time after the death of the respective patient. The following description presents data from Zeugin\u2019s fieldwork in 2015. \n \n4.1  Late Stag e \n \nAt this time, most terminally ill patients are not permanently hospitalized, \nbut are given outpatient treatment. Most conventional and anthroposophical \ncurative treatments are reduced, and the provision of anthroposophical \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n27  Cp. http://apps.swissdrg.org/manual40/drgs/54771e6ce4b0887aa13fd25c?locale  \n=de, June 4, 2018.   | 213 \n \n medical treatment shifts away from oncological practices to relieving anthro-\nposophical medical, nursing, and therapeutic practices. \nSome of the body-oriented practices stay the same throughout all stages, \nbut others are reduced,28 and some vary over time and are attributed with \ndifferent meanings, such as body wash care. No matter whether body-ori-ented practices lost importance or were continued, all options were usually rationalized by referring to anthroposophical concepts. \nIn reducing body-oriented practices, the argument was mostly based on \nthe belief that too much touching prevents patients from \u201cletting go\u201d and ac-cordingly from dying. This is expressed in the following quote from a rhyth-\nmic massage therapist:  \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve often experienced that patients who always loved rhythmic massage and who \nwanted to have it every day got to the point where every single touch was too much. And they say: No, I don\u2019t want that anymore. And mostly, this happens right before \nthey really cross the threshold. Maybe because everything that is forced on the p hys-\nical body from the outside reconnects them to it. That there is this feeling of letting \ngo of their physical body.\u201d ( Heike, rhythmic massage therapist, 8 June 2015)\n29 \n \nThe remaining body-oriented practices were often explicitly rationalized us-\ning anthroposophical concepts, again with the importance of \u201cletting go\u201d. \nThe conception of letting go is found in Girke (2012: 1053), one of the very \nfew accounts of end-of-life care written from an anthroposophical point of view. In this work, \u201cletting go\u201d is strongly linked to an alternative religious conception of the human being, as Girke refers to the fourfold articulation of \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n28  According to the observations of L\u00fcddeckens during her fieldwork in a conven-\ntional medical palliative care unit, the reduction  in body -oriented practices is not \nspecific  to the anthroposophic al setting : in conventional palliative care wards \nbody- oriented p ractices, such as hygienic measures, also lose importance.  \n29  Original wording : \u201cIch hab noch oft erlebt, dass [...] Klienten, die es (rhythmic \nmassage, BZ) immer geLIEBT haben und die JEden Tag gerne das wollten, dass es einen Punkt gibt, wo (.) jenste Ber\u00fchrung wie ihnen zu viel ist.

For example:  \n \n\u201cIn death, the I, the astral and the etheric body detach from the physical organization. \n[\u2026] A [\u2026] manner of crossing a threshold between life and death concerns the con-\nsciousness and hence the nerve -sense system. Patients grow increasingly tired, which \nis associated with the separati on of the fourfold body throughout the dying process.\u201d \n(Girke 2012: 1054, 1058)30 \n \nThis anthroposophical perception of \u201cletting go\u201d, first of the patients\u2019 physi-\ncal body at the time of death, then of their etheric body during the following \n72 hours, and finally after this time of their astral body, was also found in the hospital in this case study:  \n \n\u201cIn anthroposophy, there is the crossing of a threshold and afterwards the (transcend-\nent) bodies let go of each other. [...] And after three days all that remai ns is the [...] \ncorpse, right? And all the other bodies step by step let go of this physicality.\u201d (Lothar, \nphysician, 30 April 2015)31 \n \nOne example of this rationalization of a body-oriented practice is the convic-\ntion that certain directed ways of touching support patients in \u201cletting go:\u201d  \n \nWe often perform the so -called pentagram embrocation. They really address the hu-\nman being as a whole, in his or her individuality. And they strongly lead the person \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n30  Original wording : \u201cIm Tod verlassen das Ich, der astralische und der \u00c4therleib \ndie physische Organisation. \u201d (Girke 2012 : 1054) \u201cEine [...] Form des \u00dcberschrei-\ntens der Schwelle betrifft das Bewusstsein und das Nerven -Sinnes -System.

[\u2026] I t calms and supports letting go.\u201d (Manuela, nurse, 22 May 2015)33 \n \nIn this view, the process of \u201cletting go\u201d is facilitated by nurses acting calmly \nand silently, and deliberately touching, thus performing body care in a certain way. \nFrom an anthroposophical perspective, one aspect of the person will \ntranscend death.  This aspect is referred to most often as the soul, the spiritual dimension, or the I, as anthroposophists would say, and just as frequently it \nis linked to the idea of reincarnation. The notion of \u201cletting go\u201d is also found \nin conventional medical palliative care contexts as one of its own core se-mantics. However, here it is merely a matter of the patient\u2019s need to let go of life: \u201cAs death nears, many people feel a lessening of their desire to live longer.\u201d\n34 In the anthroposophical context, in contrast, \u201cletting go\u201d is clearly \nlinked to conceptions of human beings and the afterlife.  \nAt this stage, discursive practices that actively involve the patients are \nreduced, whereas discursive practices among the health professionals them-selves increase slightly, rationalizing the body-oriented practices, as we will see in the following examples. An important discursive practice is the nurs-ing case discussions, which are held weekly, last thirty minutes, and occur \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n32  \u201cWir [...] machen dann m anchmal auch die sogenannten [...] Pentagramm -Einrei-\nbungen.

Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland216 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n under the premise that internal and oncology nurses are physically copresent. \nAdditionally, the performance of this social practice builds on formal guide-lines aimed primarily at the rationalization of action by producing a theoret-ical description of the fourfold articulation of the body. At the same time, \nthese guidelines offer instructions for action by referring to the nurses\u2019 expe-\nriences of work and providing a list with features of each element of the four-fold body that guides them in their observations and their treatment of the patients. In preparation for the discussion of each case, one of the nurses is asked to fill in a table with her observations. The performance of the nursing case discussion is the anthroposophical nursing expert\u2019s responsibility, \nwhereas the presenting nurse varies each time. In Zeugin\u2019s observations, the \ndiscussion unfolds as follows. While all the nurses sit in the nurses\u2019 station, one nurse describes a patient who is being somewhat \u201cproblematic\u201d by using a guideline table of the fourfold bodies as a template for her presentation. In this table, the four bodies are adapted to the medical setting: the physical body is linked to visible, easily determinable aspects such as age, gender, and \nsymptoms; the etheric body carries information about respiration, body heat, \nnutrition, and expulsion, as well as creativity, habits, and everyday rhythms; the astral body is to be found in the patient\u2019s experience and communication of pain and mood, as well as thinking, feeling, and wanting; and the last body, the ego or \u201cI\u201d of the human being, is exemplified as a patient\u2019s profession, all sorts of biographical information, and indications of self-awareness, e.g., \nregarding the finiteness of his or her being. After this presentation, the other \nnurses add their own observations. Finally, possible nursing interventions are discussed by making use of a conception of anthroposophical nursing called the \u201ctwelve gestures of care\u201d in nursing.\n35 The twelve gestures, such as \nH\u00fcllen/or \u201cgrounding\u201d and Harmonisieren or \u201charmonizing,\u201d are different objectives that can be achieved by several different nursing practices. In the \ncase of a female who refused to eat in accordance with the results of her \nmeasuring each food item with a pendulum, the interventions included the following: sending in the (anthroposophist) nutritionist to discuss a balanc ed \ndiet; the affection and love of nurses spending time with her; and a footbath \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n35  This conception was developed by Rolf Heine on the basis of Stein er\u2019s belief in \nthe twelve \u201csenses\u201d ( cp. www.vfap.de/anthroposophische -pflege , July 4, 2018 ). \nThe last sense, the \u201cIch -Sinn,\u201d is based on the ego of the fourfold body concept; \ncp. von Dach 2008.   | 217 \n \n in water containing rosemary in order to \u201cground her\u201d because she seems too \n\u201cspiritually minded\u201d: \u201cShe is so spiritually minded. [\u2026] She aspires to over-come her trauma so as to not have to go through it again in her next incarna-tion\u201d (Nadja, nurse, 18 May 2015).\n36 \nAnother discursive practice is the inter-professional biographical work37 \ncase discussion. Biographical work constitutes a crucial part of anthropo-sophic medicine, as of end-of-life care. According to the biographical coun-sellor, she first conducts a conversation with a patient to learn about his or her life story. This conversation follows the pattern of seven-year cycles as-cribed to Rudolf Steiner. This pattern is again used throughout the biograph-\nical work-case discussion, as in the case of a 55- year-old woman with leu-\nkaemia. In this case, biographical work discussions brought together the at-\ntending physician, the key nurse, a physiotherapist, and a social worker, as well as representatives of all anthroposophical therapies. To begin with, they shared their initial impressions of the patient\u2019s current state. The physician said that she had recently delivered some computer tomography results and \nthat the patient didn\u2019t behave normally: \u201cShe hugged me. I don\u2019t like that, \nbut I didn\u2019t say anything. I think she is really longing for closeness\u201d (Elisa-beth, physician, 22 April 2015). The nurse adds that the patient seems very sensitive: \u201cShe reacted strongly to physical contact when I applied a rhyth-mic embrocation; it really exposed her emotions so strongly that I had to give her some tranquilizer\u201d (Nora, nurse, 22 April 2015). Afterwards, the bio-\ngraphical counsellor retold the woman\u2019s life story in accordance with the \npattern of seven-year cycles. Finally, the health professionals discussed what they had been listening to and concluded that the patient clearly lacked a basic sense of trust in her first seven years and that she had always cared more for others than for herself. From this the physician deduced the follow-ing need for action: \u201cAnthroposophically speaking, her higher self needs \nshelter, warmth and protection. [\u2026] I\u2019d recommend some nice warm poul-\ntices\u201d (Elisabeth, physician, 22 April 2015). \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n36  Original wording : \u201cSie ist so vergeistigt. [\u2026] Sie strebt an, ihr Trauma zu bew\u00e4l-\ntigen, damit sie das los ist und das nicht noch einmal machen muss, wenn sie \ninkarniert wird. \u201d \n37  \u201cBiographical work \u201d is an anthroposophic al extension of conventional psychol-\nogy complemented by the anthroposophic al theory of reincarnation and anthro-\nposophical  anthropology ; cp. Ritchie 2001 : 78ff.; Burkhard 2002.  Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland218 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n In both examples, body-practices involving the patient, such as a footbath \nand poultices, are the consequence of a discursive practice among health-\ncare professionals.38  \n \n4.2  Final Stage  \n \nOn the physical plane, the body starts shutting down and curative medical treatments become completely irrelevant. Even though the physicians are still engaged in both conventional and anthroposophical medical care, they \nwithdraw from the sickbed, leaving nurses to be more present. Once a cure \nis definitely no longer an option and discursive abilities decline, body-ori-ented practices gain more and more momentum , such as rhythmic massage. \nAccording to Margarethe Hauschka (1978), who was an assistant to \nWegman, the founder of rhythmic massage, this form of massage combines Swedish massage techniques with anthroposophical spiritual science. An-\nthroposophical anthropology and the conception of the threefold nature of \nthe human organism (nerve-sense system, metabolic-limb system, rhythmic system) are the main official rationalizations of this formalized set of prac-tices (cp. Hauschka 1978: 92\u2013100; see also above). Rhythmic massage, as its name suggests, is primarily aimed at the rhythmic system. \n \nWhereas different practices of rhythmic massage are performed at sev-\neral stages, the so-called embrocation is of great significance when it comes \nto patients who are very close to death.39 In her fieldwork, Zeugin found that \nthe pentagram embrocation is embedded in a wider scope of action. The fol-lowing account is based on her own experience of a rhythmic massage ther-apist carrying out pentagram embrocation on her for illustrative purposes. While sitting on the massage table, the therapist explained that pentagram \nembrocation requires a subsequent rest of about twenty minutes to produce \nits effect fully. She further explained that this effect consists in bringing all parts of the body back together and making the patient \u201cwhole\u201d again. The massage therapist fetched a piece of paper and, while drawing a pentagram, she continued her explanation as follows. The embrocation stems from \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n38  In the second case , however, the discussion among the healthcare professionals \nwas preceded by a biographical con versation with the patient.  \n39  Cp. v on Dach (2001) , Pflege an der Grenze des Seins, pp. 36 f.; also Layer 2006 : \n110- 116.  | 219 \n \n Leonardo, but thanks to anthroposophy this picture was assigned to the \netheric body, where the energy flow is positioned. As rhythmic massage op-erates at this level, blocked energy can be set free by indicating five essential points. According to what she had said in a previous interview, she aims to \nbring all the bodies together by pointing to these five positions on the physi-\ncal body in the correct sequence. After the treatment, she started a conversa-tion that led from the illnesses of the etheric body to the Tibetan Book of the Dead.  \nWith regard to this therapeutic practice, a conventional medical rational-\nization of action is missing altogether: there is no reference to the relief of \npain or any other distressing symptom, as required by the definition of palli-\native care, but it is primarily aimed at the patient letting go of her body and life in order to prepare for the afterlife.\n40 The link to the \u201cTibetan Book of \nthe Dead\u201d, a book that is widely popular for its content about support for th e \nsouls in the process of dying and their transition to the afterlife, even strengthened this aim. \nThis rationalization of action, i.e. letting go of the body and preparation \nfor an afterlife, is part of the discursive knowledge of all health professionals in the hospital of Zeugin's fieldwork.\n41 It comes into effect in the communi-\ncation with the particular patient, provided that the latter can still be ad-dressed and is conscious. Otherwise this body-oriented practice can be per-formed without any use of language. \n \n4.3  Terminal Stage  \n Due to the increasing loss of agency that develops in the terminal stage, an-throposophical physicians and therapists noticeably back away from the \ndeath bed, leaving it mainly to the nurses to provide all sorts of primary and \nend-of- life care. Nurses now become more autonomous and independent \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n40  See the \u201cTherapeutic Rational \u201d of massages with regard to the findings in the \nstudy of Ritchie: \u201c Through achieving balance in physic al functions, the therapist \nis able to influence and connect with the other higher  levels to promote greater \nbalance and connection between them.

Often, they perform self-\ndirected \u201clittle somethings\u201d, as one of the nurses explained:  \n \n\u201cFor me, the anthroposophical aspects just go wit h caring for the terminally ill. [\u2026] \nNot pampering them, but to giv e them a little treat \u2014in another way.\u201d (Larissa, nurse, \n26 March 2015)42 \n \nA prevalent and thus almost institutionalized instance of little somethings is the social practice of installing a rose-quartz lamp in patients\u2019 rooms. The lamps are not installed until the patient\u2019s death is foreseeable, yet from then \nonward they are lit permanently. While some nurses simply highlight the \npractice\u2019s aesthetic value, others argue that it supports the patient in letting go by providing a nice, warm, quiet ambience. \nFurthermore, nurses increasingly relocate their doings and sayings to-\nwards a set of practices that are often referred to as \u201cbeing with\u201d when the dying process progresses.\n43 Practices of \u201cbeing with\u201d are carried out so as to \nstill be doing something, even though medically nothing can be done any-more. \u201cBeing with\u201d comprises a multitude of practices, such as sitting at the patient\u2019s bedside, decorating his or her room, singing a song, narrating a story, holding the dying person\u2019s hand, and so on. Even family members are instructed just \u201cto be with\u201d their dying relatives in order\u2014 at least this is how \nthe saying goes\u2014to facilitate the process of letting go and thus promote dy-\ning. Hence, \u201cbeing with\u201d is strongly linked to conceptions of a good death, \nthe human being, and the afterlife in the form of the metaphor of letting go. \nDuring the terminal stage, practices and their rationalizations are even \nmore detached: the latter are not discursively communicated in contact with the patients, but only in interprofessional conversations or in exchanges with the researcher.  \n  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n42  Original wording : \u201cUnd f\u00fcr mich gh\u00f6rt das Anthroposophische d\u00e4nn eifach au \ndezue.

Zeugin /Walthert 2016.   | 221 \n \n 4.4  After Death  \n \nOnce a patient has died, there is still work for the physicians and nurses to \ndo until the state funeral office takes over. After a physician has issued a \ndeath certificate, the nurses are in charge of most post-mortem care practices, that is, going through the formalities, dealing with family members, and burning incense in the patient\u2019s room. It is common practice to let the de-ceased patients rest for some hours before preparing them for the laying out. Usually one nurse prepares the deceased without the bereaved being present \nand performs individual actions like closing the deceased\u2019s eyes and washing \nand clothing him or her quietly without moving the body unnecessarily. The latter aspect accords with two differing rationalizations of action, one saying that things are done like this out of sheer respect, the other that the souls need to let go of their bodies and thus need quiet.\n44 \nThe deceased are laid out in the in-house mortuary for three days. This \ntemporal determination is in line with Rudolf Steiner\u2019s conception of a pan-orama of the past life that follows death and lasts around two to three days. Whereas the physical body leaves the person at the time of death, the etheric body splits off during this subsequent period (Steiner 2001: 140).  \n \n\u201cThere is a period of rest, and in it, the bodies [\u2026] let go of their physicality. I believe \nwe overestimate ourselves if we beli eve we have a great impact on this process of \nletting go. It is connected, is connected to the person\u2019s biography, right? [\u2026] Well, I \nbelieve there is this frame, and we do not strictly lay out the deceased\u2019s body for three \ndays, but if possible.\u201d ( Lothar,  physician, 30 April 2015)45 \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n44  Both kinds of rationalizations can be found in conventional palliative care con-texts as well. However, in most cases , the deceased are prepared for their \u201cdepa r-\nture\u201d within short time of their death and incense is only burnt if a staff member \nchooses to do so as an individual . \n45  Original wording : \u201cEs gibt eine bestimmte Ruhephase, (.) in der (.) diese Leib-\nlichkeit (.) sich [...] l\u00f6sen kann.

However, whereas he considers this action as supporting the process of letting go, to him it is \nnot necessarily a precondition.\n46 This stance is in line with actual practice in \nthe hospital, which is also influenced by economic and other practical con-\nsiderations resulting from its designation as a public hospital: whereas laying out the body for three days is the usual practice, the duration may be reduced, or it may not take place at all when there are more deceased than rooms for laying out, or when the deceased or his relatives do not approve of it. How-\never, if possible the practice is performed in its original form.  \nIn addition, all health professionals are invited to participate in a collec-\ntive farewell ritual that is primarily targeted at the health professionals them-\nselves, though the deceased\u2019s family is invited too. The deceased is laid out in the middle of the small room, specifically reserved for this purpose. The room is decorated with candles and flowers, and the attendees surround the \ncoffin. The actual farewell ritual starts with a gong being sounded, and two \ntunes are chosen and performed by the health professionals.\n47 After the sing-\ning, the physician provides the deceased\u2019s biography, focusing on the de-scription and interpretation of his or her dying process and the health profes-sionals\u2019 share in it. Depending on the physician\u2019s personal assessment of the religiousness of the deceased, he may say the Lord\u2019s Prayer. The ending of \nthe ceremony is again marked by the same songs. This stage, where the med-\nical staff are still involved, is marked by religious ritualistic practices and other discursive practices, all of them in line with anthroposophical rational-izations. \nDuring the successive stages of anthroposophical end-of-life care, from \nthe late stage till the terminal stage, body-oriented practices in relation to \ndiscursive practices in contact with the patient gain momentum. However, \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n46  He pointed out that the separation of the four bodies also takes place when people \ndie a painful death and cannot be laid out, for example , when they are buried alive \nin an earthquake.  \n47  The first canon, \u201cDona Nobis Pacem \u201d (\u201cGive us peace \u201d), originates from the last \nwords of the Roman Catholic mass of Agnus Dei; the second tune, \u201cHarmonie der \nSterne \u201d (\u201cHarmony of the stars \u201d), by the German songwriter Werner Gneist, ex-\nplicitly concerns God, cre ation , and the meaning of life.   | 223 \n \n death seems to be the turning point, where body-oriented practices with re-\ngard to the deceased patient are reduced decisively, while discursive prac-tices with anthroposophical rationalizations among the healthcare profes-sionals become central. At this stage, the difference between anthroposophic \ncare as including care for the deceased and conventional medical care which \nends when the patient has passed away is most obvious. \n  \n5  R ELIGIOUS RATIONALIZA TION IN  \nEND -OF-LIFE CARE   \n As the description above indicates, it is a distinctive feature of anthropo-sophic medicine that it provides religious rationalizations that enable healthcare professionals to maintain their agency even if medical rationali-\nzations do not support further actions. \nIn conventional palliative care, less and less action is carried out over the \ncourse of the dying process.\n48 This is due to the fact that many conventional \nmedical practices are no longer of effect and communication becomes more \ndifficult, with patients losing their communication skills or their conscious-ness. However, in the case of the anthroposophical medical care in our case \nstudy, health professionals continue providing care by focusing their action \non more body-oriented practices, as we have seen above. \nWhile some more communication-oriented medical practices, such as \npsychotherapeutic interventions (\u201cbiographical work\u201d), end completely, oth-ers vary over time and become more body-oriented: eurythmy therapy,\n49 for \nexample, becomes more passive and has fewer communicative instructions \nas death approaches, as patients are not required to engage in physical activ-\nities by themselves anymore; rather, the eurythmy therapist conducts the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n48  Cp. Zeugin/ Walthert (2016) for an account of the relocation of action against the \nbackdrop of hospice end -of-life care.  \n49  Eurythmy is an anthroposophic al expressive art and movement therapy. \u201cThe \ntherapeutic rationale \u201d of eurythmy therapy appears in the findings of Ritchie as \nfollows: \u201c As with all treatments, the overall therapeutic rationale and subsequent \nprocesses are very much dependent on the individual patient and relate to a key \nprinciple of developing the potenti al of the person \u201d (2001: 76). Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland224 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n physical activities for them either by moving the patient\u2019s body parts or by \ntaking over the exercise completely and performing it herself. \nBy means of such non-discursive practices, the health professionals re-\nclaim agency, which seems to decline increasingly in the face of death. Even \nwhen it appears that nothing can be done anymore because the patient is go-\ning to die anyway, this allows health professionals to still do something for their patients and not just stand by idly. \nA typical rationalization of eurhythmy therapy is as follows: \u201cUncon-\nsciously experienced states of restlessness decrease and give way to a peace-ful state of mind. All these are important means in order to commit oneself \nto the next steps and the new spiritual space connected to death.\n\u201d50  \nEmphasis on these body-oriented practices is backed up by way of ra-\ntionalization based on an anthroposophical understanding of the dying pro-\ncess. With regard to the various activities in the different stages mentioned above, the healthcare professionals often refer to explanations pertaining to anthroposophical concepts such as the pattern of the seven-year cycles, the \nfourfold body, and the departure and reincarnation of the soul. \nIn these explanations, particular emphasis is placed on the notion of \u201clet-\nting go\u201d: Throughout the dying process, people have to let go not only of \ntheir lives, but of their bodies too. This notion is used to rationalize the body care, rhythmic massage, the \u201clittle somethings\u201d such as the rose quartz lamp, and even the effort to avoid moving the body immediately after death. This \nkind of religious rationalization enables health professionals to continue \nproviding care without focusing their actions on healing and without restrict-ing their focus on the physical existence of their patients. Instead, the idea of easing the separation of the bodies and the soul\u2019s transition into the afterlife gains importance. As already noted, this relates to a specific conception of human beings and the afterlife, as well as showing that the health profession-\nals in the anthroposophical hospital feel accountable for this kind of religious \nor spiritual care. It is this rationalization of action that distinguishes the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n50  http://www.sterben. ch/Heileurythmie.81.0.html, February 7, 2018.

Therefore, in this setting, where religion and \nmedicine intersect, reference to the religious dimension provides a funda-\nmental basis for how therapeutic practices are rationalized. \nThese examples illustrate the ways in which actors in anthroposophic \nend-of- life care, unlike those in conventional medicine, act according to the \nrules not only of the medical field but also of the alternative religious field of anthroposophy, showing how they gain agency by means of this double \norientation. \nThe body-oriented practices, like the poultices and the footbath in the \nexamples given above, are in most cases conducted because of instructions \nfrom the interprofessional nursing case and biographical work discussions. In most cases, the nurses did not rationalize these practices with anthropo-sophical concepts in contact with the patients. The first patient will probably \nnever know that she was given a footbath so as to \u201cbe grounded\u201d as a sup-\nportive measure with regard to her future reincarnation, any more than the second patient will know that the poultices will protect her \u201chigher self\u201d. In the stages in which the discursive practices are reduced there is consequently less communication about religion. However, religion is practiced by means of footbaths, poultices, the ways of performing body care, and so on. \n \n \n6  POWER STRU GGLES  \n According to Bourdieu, fields are internally structured by actors\u2019 struggles \nfor power.\n51 The valid set of rules of acting and of the distribution of power \nare the main bones of contention between leading actors who hold a monop-\noly of power and novices or oppressed actors who are trying to gain power (Bourdieu 2014: 107). In the case of end-of- life care in our case study, the \nrules of both conventional and anthroposophic medicine are at stake. There are practices based on conventional medical dispositions and others based on \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n51  For a short but concise explanation of Bourdieu s conceptualization of field, (sym-\nbolic) power , and forms of capital as manifest in habitus, material goods , and \ninstitutionalized forms, see Rageth this volume.  \u2019Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland226 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n anthroposophical dispositions and situations where struggles over the valid-\nity of different sets of rules occur. The actors involved embody a conven-tional medical habitus and an anthroposophical habitus to different degrees. Moreover, they have different degrees of symbolic power with regard to their \nanthroposophical expertise and institutional status. \nThus, the question of how, under these specific circumstances, the re-\nspective power struggles can be understood arises .\n52 Most of the actors\u2019 \nstruggles over power have to do with the fact that the actors orient themselves \nto the set of rules of more than one social field. While all actors play by the main set of rules of anthroposophical end-of-life care, they relate differently \nto conventional medicine and anthroposophy respectively. Even though in \nour case the anthroposophical medical treatment is provided by physicians, nurses, and therapists alike, a nurse who mainly refers to the conventional medical set of rules is likely to perform fewer anthroposophical medical prac-tices and to rationalize them in a less anthroposophical manner than a nurse who relates more to anthroposophy, such as the anthroposophical nursing \nexpert. \nAll nurses are trained in conventional medical nursing, yet, apart from \nthe in-house training, they have hardly any education in anthroposophical \nnursing. Accordingly, they are most likely to relate to the set of rules for conventional medicine in cases where the two fields are in conflict. \nIn contrast to the nurses, the physicians all have a general interest in \nCAM, and more than half of those who engage in end-of- life care have de-\ngrees in anthroposophic medicine in addition to their conventional medical education. The nurses and physicians who have this kind of double training occupy powerful positions within their own occupational groups, as well as throughout the hospital. For example, all attending physicians on the hospital management board are trained in anthroposophic medicine and are well-\nknown practitioners of it. Therapists, finally, are greatly involved in acting \non anthroposophical principles, as they have all been trained by an anthropo-sophical institution and are also likely to relate to anthroposophy, \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n52  As Bourdieu explains : \u201cThe struggles which take place within the field are about \nthe monopoly of the legitimate authority (specific authority) which is character-\nistic of the field in question, which means,  ultimately, the conservation of the \nstructure of the distribution of the specific capital \u201d (1995: 73).  | 227 \n \n irrespective of their professional engagement in the medical setting.53 Physi-\ncians, therapists, and the anthroposophical nursing expert, socialized within \nthe anthroposophical field, consequently tend to act in a respective habitus and prefer anthroposophical practices in cases of conflict. \nThe continuing power struggle of the actors involved in the practice of \nanthroposophical end-of- life care may be illustrated by attempts made by the \nanthroposophical nursing expert to control the doings and sayings of nurses in caring for the terminally ill and dying. By means of the nursing case dis-cussions, the anthroposophical nursing expert tried to impose a collective nursing habitus by directing it towards the anthroposophical set of rules. That \nshe was allowed to do this reflects the fact that she was accorded greater \npower than the regular nurses. This further demonstrates that the hospital\u2019s management and the supporting foundation\u2014leading actors\u2014who have not assigned a conventional medical nurse to administer further training are up-holding the anthroposophical set of rules in doing so. \nHowever, the nursing expert\u2019s influence on the nurses remains limited in \nso far as in most cases the nurses do not transfer the anthroposophical dispo-sitions taught in the actual case discussions to other cases. Furthermore, it must be noted that the practice of the nurses is informed by anthroposophical dispositions only when they consider it not to be in conflict with conventional medical practice, despite the instructions of the anthroposophical nursing ex-pert. This way of acting is in line with Bourdieu, who argues that the inten-\ntional communication and teaching of any habitus is exceptional and bound \nto fail (1997: 165\u2013169). The reasons for this are twofold. First, the incorpo-ration of objective structures involves a lengthy process of implicit learning, which for most nurses took place in the realm of conventional nursing, not in anthroposophical care. Secondly, those forms of habitus are the most ef-fective that are not informed by intention. Due to their socialization within \nconventional nursing, the nurses implicitly acquired learning about certain \nnorms that led to certain dispositions with regard to practices. In contrast to this implicit learning, the intentional teaching of the nursing expert is less influential in conflict situations, as the crucial example below will demon-strate.  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n53  A last group of actors are the terminally ill and dying patients themselves. Due to \nthe article\u2019s terms of reference, however, they will not  be dealt  with specifically \nhere.  Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland228 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n The practice of administering pain-killers and sedatives at the end of life \nposes a problem for anthroposophical end-of- life care. While many nurses \nopenly argued in favor of this practice, anthroposophical physicians tended \nto be reluctant to follow it, while the hospital management did not participate \nin any explicit discourse on the matter. One important rationalization for the \nphysicians\u2019 reluctance is the emphasis on the patient having a clear mind so as to have an opportunity for transformation and inner growth and to be able to extract experience until the very end, which is gainful for the afterlife.\n54 \nTherefore, as patients should be able to experience this transitional period consciously, anthroposophical medical care tries to avoid the use of sedating \npainkillers: \u201cThe aim is to pass away with the least required pain medication \nand a mind as conscious as possible\u201d (Lothar, physician, 30 April 2015).\n55 In \nthis context, it important to realize tha t the anthroposophical physicians \nshared the anthroposophical view that dying is not something to be prevented at all costs and that death is not dreadful. On the contrary, the time of death appears as a significant and wonderful moment in an anthroposophical view \n(Steiner 1980: 327\u2013328). Another rationalization articulated in the hospital \nwhere Zeugin's fieldwork was conducted consisted in the conviction that the \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n54  This rationalization , expressed  by the physicians in our case study , is in accord-\nance with anthroposophic  medical theory. Cp. Floriani 2016: 99 \u2013100; Girke 2012 : \n1062\u2013 1064, Gl\u00f6ckler 2008 : 471\u2013 472; Karschuck 2018: 136 \u2013144. \n55  Original wording: \u201cAlso das Ziel ist schon, [...] mit m\u00f6glichst wenig (.) \nSCHMERzmittel bei m\u00f6glichst grossem Bewusstsein diesen Schritt zu gehen.\u201d \nThe same physician explained further that many patients appreciated a state of \npainlessness: \u201cIt is as if their  pain is receding and their spiritual life gains free-\ndom\u201d (Lothar, physician, 30.4.2015); original wording: \u201cDer Schmerz tritt wie in den HINtergrund [Ja] und damit ist mein Geistesleben eigentlich freier\u201d . The goal \nto administer as few painkillers as poss ible is in accordance with von Dach 2001 : \n34\u201337. Floriani (2016) refers to Bott (1996 ) here: \u201c According to the anthropo-\nsophic approach, humans are on a path of spiritual evolution, wherein disease can play a central role in their terrestrial fates as part of a process of transformation and inner cures, with particular transformative power during the process of dying. In other words, disease is unde rstood as means of transformati on and spiritual \ndevelopment \u201d (ibid: 99\u2013100). For anthroposophical concepts , cp. Girke 2010 ; \n2012: 426, 1052\u2013 3.   | 229 \n \n dying need fewer painkillers in order to ease their pain, as they are already \nletting go of their bodies during the dying process.56 \nNurses, on the other hand, mostly preferred to administer pain-killers and \nsedatives and used conventional medical rationalizations in doing so, con-\ncentrating on the physical needs and psychological conditions of their pa-\ntients. By emphasizing their greater presence at the dying patients\u2019 sick-beds, they claimed to know their patients\u2019 wishes and needs, leading them to argue for the benefits of the conventional medical treatment of administering pain-killers and sedatives.  \nThe anthroposophical physicians were powerful actors within this an-\nthroposophical hospital because they acquired more symbolic power than other health professionals: they were officially in charge of implementing anthroposophy in the hospital, and they had both conventional and anthropo-sophical medical degrees and titles that equipped them with institutionalized cultural capital (cp. Bourdieu 1986). The nurses, by contrast, had less insti-tutionalized capital and symbolic power than the physicians who administer \nand supervise their actions. From their positions of symbolic power, the latter \ntried to control the practice of anthroposophical end-of-life care by rational-izing it in an anthroposophical manner.  \nHowever, although the nurses possess less symbolic power than the an-\nthoposophic al physicians, in many cases they prevailed. A close look at the \nactual practice indicates that although, at a rough guess, the administration \nof pain-killers and sedatives is still less common in this anthroposophical \nhospital than in conventional medical health facilities, it is still more com-mon than anthroposophic medical actors intend. Their symbolic power ulti-mately seems less than originally anticipated. Thus, when it comes to the practice of administering pain-killers and sedatives within the practice of an-throposophical end-of-life care, it is the anthroposophic al physicians in this \ncase who are the \u201coppressed actors,\u201d most probably because they orient themselves towards the alternative religious field instead of the conventional medical (or economic) field.  \nThe reasons for this finding are threefold. First, the nurses tried to act in \nconflicting situations in accordance with their own habitus, which was the conventional medical one. Secondly, they were closer to the patients at the \ncrucial time during the terminal stage once the physicians had more or less \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n56  Cp. Girke 2012 : 1061.   Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland230 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n backed away from the death bed. Thirdly, the hospital management ulti-\nmately turns the scales, even when it does not adopt a position on this issue discursively. Rather, as representatives of the hospital, its members are held responsible for its management and viability. In their doings and sayings, \nmoreover, conventional medical and economic rationalizations go hand in \nhand: being governed by the public health sector\u2019s standards and the eco-nomic habitus according to which time is money, they quite inadvertently prefer the administration of pain-killers and sedatives because it is less time-consuming than any anthroposophical end-of-life care practice and also ac-cords with the prevailing rules and regulations. \n  \n7  CONCLUSION  \n \nAnthroposophical end-of-life care belongs to both fields: from an emic per-\nspective anthroposophic medicine complements conventional medicine with \nspiritual knowledge, while from an etic perspective it pursues medical as well as spiritual and religious goals. This study, based on fieldwork in an anthro-posophical hospital, has provided three main insights about social practices in the intersection between the religious and the medical fields.  \nFirst,  in the course of anthroposophical end-of- life care, body-oriented \npractices that are rationalized by anthroposophical religious concepts gain momentum in relation to discursive practices in contact with the patients. After death, discursive practices among healthcare professionals gain in im-portance, while body-oriented practices with regard to the deceased lose in importance.  \nSecondly, by rationalizing their actions in a religious (anthroposophical) \nway amongst themselves, healthcare professionals not only explain their ac-tions, they also regain agency in the face of a terminal illness backed up by the institution. Body-oriented practices with anthroposophical rationaliza-tions therefore serve as a resource not only for patients but for staff members too, enabling the latter to support their patients even when, from a conven-tional medical point of view, nothing can be done anymore. From an anthro-\nposophical perspective, not only does the physical body have to be taken care \nof but other non-empirical bodies also have to be taken into account. One of the main references in this regard is the notion that patients need to let go of their various bodies throughout the dying process and beyond death and are  | 231 \n \n in need of support. Other rationalizations are the support of the souls\u2019 prep-\naration for the afterlife by taking care of the transcendent bodies and trans-cendent aspects of the dying patients. \nIt is important to note that, in the later stages of end-of-life care, anthro-\nposophical rationalizations occur in inter-professional communication, or in communication with the researcher, and only rarely in communication with the patients. Nevertheless, even though religion might not be a topic of staff-patient conversations, it is still practiced in the form of massages, baths, poul-tices, so-called \u201clittle somethings,\u201d and further body-oriented practices. \nThirdly, the examples in this study have shed light on the social context \nwithin which anthroposophical end-of-life care is carried out. The healthcare professionals are constantly contending with each other over the distribution of power and the appropriate set of rules to follow. Yet, anthroposophical end-of- life care -providers are not only contending with each other over their \nrespective social positions within a particular social field, they are also strug-gling over the different fields of (conventional) medicine and (alternative) \nreligion. It is the anthroposophical foundation of anthroposophical end-of-\nlife care that causes its actors to become involved in additional work and expense, as they not only act in accordance with the conventional medical field, but also orient themselves towards anthroposophy\u2019s own set of rules. Whereas this mostly occurs without problems, the need to play by two dif-ferent set of rules at the same time makes the practice of anthroposophical \nend-of-life care liable to conflict.\n57 \nAs we have seen, those physicians and nurses who are also trained in \nanthroposophic medicine generally have a higher social status. This does not \nmean, however, that they are more powerful in practice. As indicated by the practice of administering pain-killers and sedatives, the actions of nurses are determined rather by the habitus they have acquired in their conventional \nmedical training than by the influence of the anthroposophically trained nurs-\ning expert or physicians, notwithstanding her or their higher social position.  \nGiven that the hospital in question is an anthroposophical institution, one \nmight have expected that in cases of conflict medical treatment would be in \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n57  This is all the more the case when i t comes to discursive practices, such as an \nopen discussion about administr ating painkillers and sedatives, because dis-\ncourses require greater explanation and  thus more easily uncover conflicting is-\nsues and demands for autonomy.  Anthroposophical End-Of-Life Care in Switzerland232 | Barbara Zeugin , Dorothea L\u00fcddeckens, Monika Schrimpf  \n line with anthroposophical principles. In that case, in the example of pain-\nkillers and sedatives at the end of life, the position of the anthroposophical physicians would prevail. This is especially the case since anthroposophical physicians have more symbolic power than nurses because of their institu-\ntional position and their anthroposophical expertise. However, Zeugin s \nfieldwork revealed that in many cases the nurses successfully negotiated with the physicians in charge in favor of giving pain-killers and sedatives. Hence, often the nurses  position was implemented at the bedside. \nWe argue that there are three explanations for this:  a) Nurses are closer to the patients in terms of time, body care, and emo-\ntional contact during the last stages of life. This might be even more the case in anthroposophical end-of-life care because more body-oriented care prac-tices are performed in this period, as we have outlined above. \nb) Nurses tend to act according to their conventional medical habitus in \ncases of conflict between anthroposophical and conventional medical prac-tices and their respective rationalizations.  \nc) The hospital\u2019s management, including the most influential physicians, \nwho are anthroposophically oriented, has to keep the financial conditions of the hospital in mind. However, the financial challenges are rooted partly in the hospital\u2019s specialization in anthroposophic medicine, which goes along with additional remedies and technical facilities, as well as the greater ex-penditure of time involved in care. Examples are the applying of a poultice \nor a rhythmic embrocation instead of administering pain-killers and sedatives \nat the end of life.  \nThus, the anthroposophical hospital in question stands between the de-\nmands of the public health sector, its patients\u2019 needs and demands, the care-givers\u2019 attendance, and the anthroposophical orientation of its supporting foundation. All these interests mingle when it comes to anthroposophical \nend-of-life care, as they are apparently not located within the boundaries of \nany one social field. \n  \nBIBLIOGRAPHY  \n Arman, Maria/Ranheim, Albertine/Rehnsfeldt, Arne/Wode, Kathrin (2008): \n\u201cAnthroposophic health care\u2014different and home-like\u201d, in: Scandina-vian Journal of Caring Sciences 22/3, pp. 357\u2013366. \u2019\n\u2019 | 233 \n \n Bopp, Annette/Heine, Rolf (2008): Anthroposophische Pflege.

In this paper, the psychological \nschool of \u201cTranspersonal Psychology\u201d (TP) and specifically the work of the psychia-\ntrist and LSD researc her Stanislav Grof is introduced in order to illuminate the inter-\nferences between psychological or therapeutic discourses and religious discourses. Of particular interest are psychological approaches to Near -Death Experiences (NDE) \nand the way in which the y become productive of religious imaginary. In this way, this \npaper will outline the boundaries between science and religion, or rather the fluidity \nof such boundaries, using the example of a specific discourse as manifested in schol-\narly approaches to Near -Death Experiences in Transpersonal Psychology.  \n \n \n1  INTRODUCTION  \n Of all the scientific disciplines that have dealt with the topic of near- death \nexperiences (NDEs), psychology and psychiatry have played a special role. The first scientific studies of the topic in the twentieth century were both 242 | Stephanie Gripentrog   \n written by psychiatrists.1 At the same time, psychological explanations of \nNear -Death Experiences (NDE)2 form only one group of many, as yet frag-\nmentary attempts to explain them scientifically. The aim of this article is to \nexamine the  relationship of a very specific and contested psychological \nschool\u2014\u201cTranspersonal Psychology \u201d (TP) \u2014to religion, as exemplified by \nits approach to NDEs. \nGiven the proximity of NDE research to religion, as well as its dissemi-\nnation in society in general, the topic is a complex one. Anyone who wants to examine the approaches of psychology and psychiatry to NDEs from the perspective of the academic Study of Religion will therefore have to limit the \nstudy to just a few aspects. Accordingly, this article is structured as follows. \nI begin with an examination of the concept of experience as a key idea in \nthe psychology of religion, which will be exemplified by a brief analysis of \nthe work of William James in this area. The writings of this \u201cclassical\u201d author are more than one hundred years old, but they are still one of the key refer-ence points for more recent branches of psychology that deal with NDEs. In \naddition, James\u2019s concept of religious experience can still be seen as ground-\nbreaking in contemporary discussions of this topic. \nThe subsequent section introduces the concept of Transpersonal Psychol-\nogy, which is considered marginal within academic psychology and has given rise to controversies regarding whether it even is a legitimate part of it. Nonetheless, it is above all here where the issues of peak and border ex-\nperiences in general and of NDEs in particular have been argued to be ther-\napeutically fruitful and have become the vehicle for a new form of dealing with death, which, for good reasons, can be called religious. Special attention will therefore be paid to the interference between psychological or therapeu-tic discourses and religious discourses, using the work of the psychiatrist and LSD researcher Stanislav Grof as an example to illustrate this in detail. \nThe analysis will be completed by some reflections on the extent to which \nthe phenomenon of NDEs can also be described as a new and very specific \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1  Elisabeth K\u00fcbler -Ross and Raymond Moody were instrumental in shaping early \nresearch on NDE, as well as the term itself.  \n2  For contemporary psychiatric and psychological research, cp . Khanna/Greyson \n2014: 1605 \u20131615; Britton/Bootzin 2004: 254 \u2013258; Wren- Lewis 2004: 90 \u201392. For \nan example of an approach from medical anthropology , cp. Corazza 2008.    Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion  | 243 \n form of contemporary religiosity, as well as on the role that TP and psycho-\ntherapy play in this context. \nThe treatment of the issue in this article is therefore twofold: on the one \nhand, the topic is presented from the perspective of the psychology of reli-\ngion; on the other hand, discourses of TP about NDEs as a religious  phenom-\nenon are analyzed from the perspective of the academic Study of Religion. \n \n \n2  ON THE CONCEPT OF EX PERIENCE  \n \nThe concept of NDEs has constantly been questioned since the beginning of research on the topic. Reasons for this include the fact that a lot of people actuall y report features of an NDE without having been close to death at all \n(van Lommel 2001: 2039\u20132045). Thus, the term loses its differentia specifica  \nin relation to other extraordinary experiences, most notably so-called out-of-\nbody experiences, on which a lot of research is currently being conducted \nand which are frequently, though not always, reported as part of an NDE (Blanke et al. 2016: 323\u2013347). At the same time, recent neurological research also shows that out-of-body experiences and NDEs \u201cmay share important functional and brain mechanisms, but clearly point towards distinct mecha-nisms as well\u201d (ibid: 333). \nSince Moody\u2019s study (1975), which listed fifteen different aspects (alt-\nhough none of them had featured fully in any of the 150 cases he analyzed), various attempts have been made to develop a phenomenology of the most important characteristics of an NDE (Blanke et al. 2016: 331). Further prob-lems stand in the way of a definition, especially cultural and regional varia-tions in recorded experiences\n3 and the fact that they are only accessible \nthrough the medium of language or imagery. \nWhat is more important for the purposes of this paper is the observation \nthat the notion of NDEs, whether clear or meaningful or not, serves as a fun-damental concept not only in scientific research, but also in the respective social discourse and practices, regardless of any possible inconsistencies with regard to its meaning. Here, Mieke Bal\u2019s reflections on concepts are \nhelpful: \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n3  For further literature see,  for example , the study by Hubert Knoblauch (1999) \ncomparing the NDEs of East and West Germans . 244 | Stephanie Gripentrog   \n \u201cMostly, they are considered abstract represe ntations of an object. But, like all repre-\nsentations, they are neither simple nor adequate in themselves. They distort, unfix, \nand inflect the object. [...] In fact, concepts are, or rather do, much more. If well \nthought through, they offer miniature theories, and in that guise, help in the analysis \nof objects, situations, states, and other theories. [...] They travel \u2014between disciplines, \nbetween individual scholars, between historical periods, and between geographically \ndispersed academic communities. Betw een disciplines, their meaning, reach, and op-\nerational value differ.\u201d (Bal 2009: 11 \u201312) \n \nThus, the concept of NDEs should be understood as one that moves between \ndifferent disciplines and that facilitates their interdisciplinary dialogue, pre-\ncisely because it is more than a simple word, though also less than an elabo-rate theory (ibid: 15). \nThe debates on the general concept of experience in both the psychology \nof religion and the Study of Religion have been similarly complex, especially because it has been so crucial to both disciplines. The related debate already \nstarted when the psychology of religion began to emerge as an empirical sci-\nence in the United States around 1900. William James, one of its key repre-sentatives, dealt with it in detail in his much-read work, The  Varieties of Re-\nligious Experience . At that time, the spiritualist movement was in full blos-\nsom, with attempts being made to contact the dead in the hereafter by means of spiritualist mediums in s\u00e9ances where occultist practices such as table-\nturning were highly popular. \nFrequently at this time, renowned psychologists and psychiatrists were \nalso present at the s\u00e9ance tables, trying to find alternative explanations for \nthe observed phenomena and, in the process, triggering highly controversial discussions about the status and role of psychology and psychiatry as scien-tific disciplines.\n4 Thus, psychology and psychiatry were already involved in \nthe search for an alternative, scientific approach to the so-called \u201cbeyond\u201d long before modern research on NDEs started. James was among those psy-chologists whose theories were heavily based on analysis of such extraordi-nary phenomena, and his work, The Varieties of Religious Experience , is full \nof examples of this kind. \nHowever, one key element in his reflections is the question of the actual \nobject of research in the psychology of religion and the ontological status of \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n4  For further literature see Treitel 2004  or also Gripentrog  2016.   Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion  | 245 \n the object of religious experience itself. Discussing this question in detail, he \npoints out that it is not the task of science to provide evidence regarding questions of religious truth, let alone the ontological status of objects of reli-gious experience. Rather, science must limit itself to the description of the \nexperiences of those who \u201capprehend themselves to stand in relation to what-\never they may consider the divine\u201d (James 1902: 32). What is of special in-terest to him, then, is the intensity of this experience, which those affected describe as an increased perception of reality, a reality \u201cwhich no adverse argument, however unanswerable by you in words, can expel from your be-lief\u201d (ibid: 72). Thus, he writes: \n \n\u201cAll our attitudes, moral, practical or emotional, as well as religious, are due to the \n\u201cobjects\u201d of our consciousness, the things which we believe to exist, whether really \nor idea lly, along with ourselves. Such objects may be present to our senses, or they \nmay only be present to our thought. In either case, they elicit from us a reaction ; and \nthe reaction due to things of thought is notoriously in many cases as strong as that due \nto sensible presences. It may be even stronger. \u201d (ibid: 53)   \n \nHence, James is not concerned with deciding whether a \u201creal\u201d object corre-sponds to such an experience or, if so, what kind of object. Rather, answering this question seems wholly irrelevant to the value of such an experience. In-stead, both real and ideal objects are simply objects of consciousness that, as \nsuch, \u201ccoexist\u201d within us. James, writing as a philosopher here, anticipated \nan important insight of contemporary brain research at this point, which has confirmed that the same brain areas are active in imagining as in visually perceiving a real object (Traut 2015: 33). For the brain, it seems to make no difference if something is just imagined or actually experienced. \nThus, for James and his question about the ontological status of the object \nof religious experience, this means that it does not really matter whether the experience is real or to what extent. In the first of his twenty lectures that make up Varieties , he discusses the closeness of religious experiences to \npathological ones, a topic that has also been discussed with regard to NDEs. In doing so, he states explicitly that there is no real possibility of making a clear distinction between them. In particular, \u201c\u2018geniuses\u2019 in the religious \nline\u201d frequently show, as James puts it, \u201csymptoms of nervous instability\u201d \nand are therefore often \u201csubject to abnormal psychical visitations\u201d (James 1902: 8). At the same time, this might be precisely the reason for their special 246 | Stephanie Gripentrog   \n religious meaning, because \u201coften [\u2026] these pathological features in their \ncareer have helped to give them their religious authority and influence\u201d (ibid: 8). The physiological and possibly even pathological causes of such experi-ences are therefore not relevant to James compared to their consequences for \nthe life of the person having them (ibid: 51). \nAt any rate, from James\u2019s point of view, the emotional reactions triggered \nby such \u201cobjects of consciousness\u201d can be extremely intense. He writes: \n \n\u201cThey are as convincing to those who have them as any direct sensible experiences \ncan be, and they are, as a rule, much more convincing than results established by mere \nlogic ever are. [\u2026] if you do have them, and have them at all strongly, the probability \nis that you cannot help regardin g them as genuine perceptions of truth, as revelations \nof a kind of reality which no adverse argument, however unanswerable by you in words, can expel from your belief.\u201d (ibid: 72)  \n \nThe subjective power of the persuasion of such experiences seems to be over-\nwhelming and can scarcely be questioned anymore. What James describes \nhere can easily be matched with numerous reports of NDEs, and it also high-lights an aspect that is repeatedly discussed in current research: the claim of those concerned that such experiences were, so to speak, \u201cmore real than real\u201d. In their 2013 neuroscientific study, Thonnard et al. (2013) state that the clarity of memories of NDEs often exceeds the actual experience of them: \n \n\u201cA recent study compared NDE memories to real and imagine d memories, including \nnon- NDE coma memories. It was found that NDE memories had richer content than \nall other types of memories, including better clarity and more self -referential and emo-\ntional information, suggesting that memories of NDEs are more akin to  flashbulb \nmemories and hallucinatory experiences than imagined events. These characteristics \nseem related to the content of the memory per se, rather than medical factors or actual \ncloseness to death, and help understand why such experiences are often perceived as \u2018super real,\u2019 even more so than real recent events.\u201d   \n(Thonnard et al. as cited in Blanke  et al. 2016: 334)  \n \nBut how can a scientific description deal with this kind of recourse to expe-\nrience\u2014an experience that claims to be even \u201cmore real than real\u201d? Despite \nthe continuing popularity of James\u2019s approach, the conceptualization of reli-gion based on the concept of experience has found no lasting success. Even  Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion  | 247 \n though it was established as a key term in the first half of the twentieth cen-\ntury, especially in the discipline of the phenomenology of religion, it was more or less abolished as \u201ctoo religious\u201d in the course of the reorientation of the academic Study of Religion as a cultural science in the second half of that \ncentury (Gladigow 1988: 6\u201337). \nIn the case of both religious experiences and NDEs, the question also \narises under what conditions such \u201cexperiences\u201d can be scientifically de-\nscribed at all. The German sociologist and scholar of the Study of Religion Volkhard Krech has therefore proposed a different approach following his research on conversion, one that highlights the aspect of communication in-\nstead of experience. In his view, one implication of adopting a communica-tive paradigm is that religious experience should not be understood (at leas t \nnot exclusively) as a consciousness-like structure that is inaccessible to com-\nmunication and thus to the sociological perspective, but instead as something that is constituted by communication and therefore is to be understood as a social fact (Krech 2005: 358). \nSuch experiences may be conceived, described, or even made visible \nthrough imaging procedures, as they are never directly  accessible to research. \nThe possibility of scientific, intersubjective access thus ends with the ex-\npressed (mostly linguistically), mediated experience. Looked at in this fash-\nion, new, interdisciplinary approaches become relevant that deal, for exam-ple, with questions of the narrative format of an NDE or the relationship be-\ntween narrative and experience in their mutual reciproci ty. \nBut what are recent psychological studies on NDEs dealing with if not \nwith the question of experience? Here, questions about the relationship be-\ntween mental health and the occurrence of NDEs have become very promi-nent. In his research, Kenneth Ring, for example, asked whether people re-porting an NDE differed in any way from the normal population in terms of \ntheir mental health. They were found to be no less healthy than the control \ngroup, but still differed from them in certain other respects (cp. Ring 1980; Greyson 1999: 7\u201319). This involved, for example, an increased susceptibility to hypnosis, the ability to remember dreams better and the ability to use im-agination (cp. Irwin 1985). There also seemed to be an accumulation of trau-matic childhood experiences among this group, with feelings of alienation \nfrom the environment as a consequence (cp. Ring 1992).  \nPrevious psychological research on NDEs has primarily dealt with the \nquestion of how such experiences can be explained, suggesting that NDEs 248 | Stephanie Gripentrog   \n could be a mental defense mechanism initiated by confrontation with immi-\nnent death (Vaitl 2012: 157). \nAnother explanation that goes in a similar direction sees memories of the \nbirthing process at work during the tunnel experience (Gabbard/Twemlow \n1991: 41\u201347). Grof's approach is similar  but will be discussed later in detail. \nDepersonalization theory also invokes a defence mechanism as an explana-\ntion; due to an acute situation of crisis, the organism is put into a state of alarm, which causes dissociation of the crisis situation. This prevents the in-dividual from being forced to live through its full drama (Vaitl 2012: 157). \nHowever, Dieter Vaitl, summing up the various approaches to psycho-\nlogical explanation, points out that there is still no explanation of the discrep-ancy between physiological restriction and the complexity of experience (2012: 156). Thus, important questions regarding explanations for these phe-nomena remain unanswered. \nThe following analysis will be less concerned with making a further at-\ntempt to provide such clarifications than with describing a very specific psy-\nchological and psychiatric approach to the topic. The notion of TP that is \ninvoked here is characterized by its comprehensive claim to be able to ex-plain the occurrence of such experiences in their entirety, while at the same time being largely excluded from academic psychology as unscientific. It is, therefore, in no way representative of the history of psychological and psy-chiatric engagement with the topic of NDEs, though historically it is still \nlocated at the inception of NDE research. \n  \n3  ON \u201c TRANSPERSONAL PSYCHOLOGY \u201d \n \nSo-called \u201cTranspersonal Psychology\u201d represents a special case within mod-\nern academic psychological research (Walach et al. 2005: 405\u2013415). As a psychological movement founded in the late 1960s, it mainly defined itself through its organ of publication, the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology , \nand its related society, the Transpersonal Association. However, it can \nhardly be characterized as a homogeneous movement, nor even as a school. \nInstead, its origins can best be described as heterogeneous (ibid: 405). Dif-\nferent authors influenced its emergence, conceiving TP in very different ways. These include especially Antony Sutich, who wrote the constitutive article of the discipline in the first volume of the Journal  in 1969, Stanislav  Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion  | 249 \n Grof, who became known to the public mainly through his research on LSD, \nAbraham Maslow, the creator of the so-called hierarchy of needs, and above all the autodidact Ken Wilber, who began to develop a system of TP in the mid-1970s. \nBoth Sutich and Maslow characterized TP as the \u201cfourth force\u201d coming \nat the end of an upward development, with behaviorism as the first force, psychoanalysis as the second and humanistic psychology as the third. As such, they understood it as completing and absorbing the previous stages of \npsychological theorizing and therapy. For Maslow, this implied an explicit reference to transcendence, which was also to be part of his new psycholog-\nical anthropology and its corresponding therapy. He wrote: \u201cWithout the \ntranspersonal, we get sick, violent and nihilistic, or else hopeless and apa-thetic.\u201d (Maslow 1968: iii\u2013iv ) \nFor Maslow, the starting point of this approach was an explicitly anti-\nmaterialist anthropology. He did not orient himself to the average or the men-tally ill, but to the concept of a healthy, even above-average human, who has \nfully developed his or her potential, a process he called \u201cself-realization\u201d. In \nhis opinion, only very few people have ever achieved this level. Maslow said in a lecture in 1962: \n \n\u201cWhen I started to explore the psychology of health, I picked out the finest, healthiest \npeople, the best specimens of mankind I could find, and studied them to see what they \nwere like. [\u2026] I found that these indivi duals tended to report having had something \nlike mystic experiences, moments of great awe, moments of the most intense happi-\nness or even rapture, ecstasy or bliss.\u201d  (1962: 9)  \n \nThese remarks of Maslow\u2019s remind the reader strongly of William James\u2019s \nsuggestion to deal not with the experiences of the average religious human \nbeing, but with the most outstanding, extraordinary cases instead. The reason \nfor this, according to James, is that the essence of religion and religious ex-perience can best be studied with reference to extreme cases  (1902: 8). Sim-\nilarly, it recalls Maslow\u2019s specific conceptualization of the concept of expe-rience through which TP acquires its profile in relation to other branches of psychology and psychotherapy. Again, the reference to William James is ob-\nvious. Maslow calls such experiences\u2014these moments of great awe, intens e \nhappiness, ecstasy, and bliss\u2014peak experiences  (Maslow 1964). 250 | Stephanie Gripentrog   \n But what role do NDEs play in this regard? Their relationship to the ap-\nproach described above will be explained below, using the example of an-\nother important representative of TP, Stanislav Grof. \n \n \n4  STANISLAV GROF\u2019S RESEARCH ON LSD AND ITS \nRELATIONSHIP TO NEAR -DEATH EXPERIENCES  \n \nIn 1943, the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann discovered the substance LSD \nand, at first through self-experiment, experienced its enormous effect on the human psyche (Hofmann 1979). The Czech psychiatrist and psychotherapist Stanislav Grof was one of the first to receive samples of the new substance from Basel. One of his main questions was about the therapeutic potential of LSD, as it was initially considered to be a means of generating model psy-\nchoses that could be explored and then possibly cured (Grof 1980). Very \nsoon, Grof also started to be interested in the potential significance of the \nsubstance for the dying. Thus, in 1974 he took over the leadership of the so-called Spring Grove Program  at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Centre, \nUSA,\n5 from Walter Pahnke, who himself had already become well known \nfor his so-called Good Friday Experiment  (Pahnke 1966: 85\u2013106). Origi-\nnally, the program had been dedicated to the effects of LSD on schizophren-ics and alcoholics, but in 1966, the research was thematically reoriented, in-itiated through an employee of the Research Department who had fallen se-verely ill with cancer and decided to test the effects of LSD in view of her approaching death. \nThis was the third attempt worldwide to treat terminally ill cancer pa-\ntients with LSD and it was scientifically documented. Its impressive results (Pahnke et al. 1970: 1856\u20131863) initiated a new research project on the ef-fects of LSD on such patients. For two decades, the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center and its research facility became the site of intense research on LSD. The very first pilot study produced astonishing results,\n6 which the \nauthors themselves directly related to Maslow\u2019s concept of peak experiences : \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n5  More on the history of this program cp. Yensen /Dryer 1995 : 73\u2013101. \n6  Cp. Richards et al . 1972: 121\u2013149.  Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion  | 251 \n \u201cIt has been our clinical impression that the most dramatic therapeutic changes fol-\nlowed sessions in which the patient experienced an intense ps ychedelic peak experi-\nence, the phenomenological description of which corresponded to the categories of (1) unity, (2) transcendence of time and space, (3) objectivity and reality, (4) sense of \nsacredness, (5) deeply felt positive mood and (6) ineffability [\u2026] Profound experi-\nences of this kind were described by approximately 25% of the patients in this study. \nThese patients were often those who seemed most completely free of a fear of death following their sessions.\u201d (Richards et al. 1972: 142)  \n \nThe assumptions based on this research were that LSD, combined with good \ntherapeutic support for cancer patients close to death, could help to relieve \nthem of anxiety and associated symptoms. As the passage quoted above makes clear, the aspect of the peak experience  was decisive right from the \nstart. The authors describe it using terms such as unity, transcendence of space and time, objectivity and reality, a sense of holiness, deeply positive moods, and ineffability; aspects that can all also be found in phenomenolog-\nical descriptions of NDEs. \nThese similarities become even more obvious in The Human Encounter \nwith Death, which Grof published together with Joan Halifax in 1977. This work was published only two years after Moody's Life after Life , (cp. 1975) \nand Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross, in her foreword to Grof and Halifax\u2019s volume, explicitly pointed out the close connection between the two pieces of re-\nsearch  (cp. Grof/Halifax 1977). Also, the two authors themselves repeatedly \nreferred to Moody\u2019s work (cp. Grof/Halifax 1977). The reports they collected \nand presented in their volume on the experiences of patients treated with LSD include out-of-body experiences as well as various forms of life review, en-counters with the dead, and even a light identified as \u201cdivine.\u201d\n7 Some of the \npatients who had both an LSD experience and an NDE confirmed the striking \nsimilarities between them: \n \n\u201cDuring  the operation  Ted had two cardiac arrests  resulting  in clinical  death  and was \nresuscitated  on both occasions.  [...] At the same  time, however , he was involved  in a \nnumber  of unusual  experiences.  [...] The initial darkness  was replaced  by brilliant  \nlight,  and he was able to approach  it and fuse with it. The feelings  he described  on \nexperiencing  the light  were  those  of sacredness  and deep  peace.  [...] Before  we left \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n7  For further similarities, cp. Bryant  2003: 143\u2013 144. 252 | Stephanie Gripentrog   \n him that day, he emphasized  how glad he was that he had had three  LSD  sessions.  He \nfound the experience of actual dying extremely  similar  to his psychedelic  experiences  \nand considered  the latter  excellent  training  and preparation.  \u2018Without the sessions  I \nwould  have  been scared  by what  was happening,  but knowing  these  states,  I was not \nafraid  at all.\u2019\u201d (Grof/Halifax  1977:  181\u2013182) \n \nDespite these remarkable parallels, Grof and Halifax also pointed out that \nthere is an important difference, at least from the accounts in Moody\u2019s work: the descriptions of his cases lacked mythological elements, or, as Grof and Halifax put it, the \u201ccartoon sky\u201d of LSD experiences, with all its multiform \nexpressions of archetypal images of deities and demons. \nBut how can these parallels be explained? According to Grof and Hali-\nfax: \n \n\u201cObservations from psychedelic research, as well as data from history, comparative \nreligion and anthropology, seem to indicate that we all harbo ur functional matrices in \nour unconscious minds that contain an authentic encounter with death. Activation of these unconscious structures by psychoactive drugs, or by nondrug factors and tech-niques, results in a dramatic experience of death that, in terms of its intensity, is in-distinguishable from actual dying.\u201d (ibid: 9)  \n \nIt is this explanation that will be discussed in more detail below. In the course \nof his more than fifty years of research, Grof developed a new and very spe-\ncific model of the human psyche, which he also uses to explain NDEs. Fur-thermore, his approach ultimately embodies the comprehensive claim to put psychology and psychotherapy on a completely new basis and, at the same time, to initiate a scientific paradigm shift (Grof 2012: 137\u2013163). He writes:  \n \n\u201cIn the last five decade s, various avenues of modern consciousness research have re-\nvealed a rich  array of \u2018anomalous\u2019 phenomena \u2014experiences and observations that \nhave undermined some of the generally accepted assertions of modern psychiatry, \npsychology, and psychotherapy concerni ng the nature and dimensions of the human \npsyche, the origins of emotional and psychosomatic disorders, and effective therapeu-tic mechanisms. Many of these observations are so radical that they question the basic \nmetaphysical assumptions of materialistic s cience concerning the nature of reality and \nof human beings and the relationship between consciousness and matter.\u201d (ibid: 138)  \n  Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion  | 253 \n The consequences of this for the roles of psychology, psychiatry, and psy-\nchotherapy in the \u201creligious field\u201d will be discussed in section five. \nAt this point, it is appropriate to explain the matrices mentioned by Grof \nin more detail. He has constantly elaborated this model to this day, which is \nan essential result of his work, taking into account the experiences of numer-\nous clients, comparisons between whom revealed nothing less than the need for a new cartography of the psyche (cp. Grof 1975). Due to his research on extraordinary states of consciousness, he has extended the traditional view of the psyche into two further major areas (see Fig. 1). \n \n Fig. 1. Sketch of Grof\u2019s cartography of the human psyche. \nSource: Illustration by Stephanie Gripentrog based on Grof (1975).  \n \nBeyond content from the postnatal biographical level (from birth to adult-hood), people in exceptional states of consciousness can gain access to the \narea of birth (experiences in the womb and during birth = perinatal domain) \nand the so-called transpersonal domain. He compares the experiences of these domains with those of mystics and shamans, as well as with C.G. Jung\u2019s concept of the collective unconscious. Two aspects are of further im-portance to him: the so-called COEX systems, and Basic Perinatal Matrices . \nCOEX systems are systems of condensed experience : \n  \n254 | Stephanie Gripentrog   \n \u201cA typical COEX system consists of many layers of unc onscious material that share \nsimilar emotions or physical sensations; the contributions to a COEX system come \nfrom different levels of the psyche.  \nMore superficial and easier available layers contain memories of emotional or physi-\ncal traumas from infancy,  childhood, and later life. On a deeper level, each COEX \nsystem is typically connected to a certain aspect of the memory of birth, a specific \nBPM; the choice of this matrix depends on the nature of the emotional and physical feelings involved. [\u2026] The deep est roots of COEX systems underlying emotional and \npsychosomatic disorders reach into the transpersonal domain of the psyche.\u201d (Grof 2012: 150)  \n \nFurthermore, Grof noted that these systems tend to be associated with certain \naspects of the birth process, which he then summarized as Basic Perinatal \nMatrices  (see Figure 2). \n \nFig. 2. Basic Perinatal Matrices \nSource: Grof 1994: 31. \n \nAs such, they also provide the pattern for different forms of transpersonal experience. Grof distinguishes four different Basic Perinatal Matrices , as \nshown in Fig. 2. These are listed below in a simplified and shortened table according to Grof (see Table 1). \n \n  \n Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion  | 255 \n Table 1. \nMatrix I: \nUnity with ma-ternal organism Matrix II: \nFirst stage of the birth pro-cess when the uterus con-tracts, but t he \ncervix is not yet open Matrix III: \nStruggle to be born after the uterine cervix di-lates Matrix IV: \nSeparation from the mother \nRelated memories from life after birth \nHappy memories \nof infancy or childhood, atten-tion from the mother, ro-\nmances, swim-\nming in the sea Situations that \nwere associ-ated with dan-ger to life, ac-cidents, inju-\nries, surgeries, \nsevere psycho-logical trauma Fights, adven-\ntures, intoxicating experiences, vic-tim of seduction or rape Escape from \ndangerous sit-uations, over-coming diffi-cult obs tacles \nby own efforts \n \nRelated phenomena from LSD sessions \nUndisturbed in-\ntra-uterine life: \nOceanic ecstasy, \noneness with the \ncosmos, paradise visions Disturbances of the intra-uterine life: \nFeeling of being devoured, disgust, visions of demons and evil m eta-\nphysical forces Devouring \nmaelstrom, vi-olent physical \nand mental \nsuffering, feel-ing of an un-bearable hope-less situation, hell vision, \nfeelings of  \nfutility and  absurdity of  human exist-ence Intensification of \nsuffering to cos-mic dimensions, \nsimultaneous sen-\nsation of pleasure and pain, sado-masochistic or-gies, participation in bloody battles, \nexperiences of \ndeath and rebirth, religious blood sacrifice motifs, intense body reac-tions Sudden release \nof a strong pressure, vi-\nsions of gigan-\ntic halls, radi-ant light and beautiful col-ours, feelings of rebirth and \nsalvation, in-\ntensification of \n \nsensory im-\npressions \nSource: Table by Stephanie Gripentrog based on  Grof (1994: 30 \u201331). 256 | Stephanie Gripentrog   \n This sketch suggests that experiences made in extraordinary states of con-\nsciousness are not chaotic but follow very specific patterns and can come from all three different levels of consciousness. Thus, experiences from the recent or distant past, as well as experiences around birth and in the last re-\nsort, also from areas that Grof calls \u201ctranspersonal,\u201d are possible. Through a \nstrong and qualitatively similar emotional quality or physical sensation, t hese \nvery diverse contents are linked together, and it is through this mechanism that the transitions from one content of experience to the next can be ex-plained. In addition, the respective experiences can be assigned to the four Basic Perinatal Matrices , which structure the experience thematically. But \nhow does the access work? And what are the reasons for particular experi-ences and their timing? For this too, Grof has an explanation that is particu-larly relevant therapeutically. He writes: \n \n\u201cThe techniques that can directly activate the unconscious seem to reinforce selec-\ntively the most relevant emotional material and facilitate its emergence into con-\nsciousness. They thus provide a kind of inner radar that scans the system and detects the material with the strongest charge and emotional significance.\u201d  (1988: 4)  \n \nThis means that it is not the therapist who decides which topic to work on, \nbut rather that the topic with the \u201cstrongest emotional charge\u201d will naturally come to the surface. As such, it can then work as a door to deeper levels of \nconsciousness. Grof explains this structure by means of a clinical example: \n \n\u201cA person suffering from psych ogenic asthma might discover in serial breathwork \nsessions a powerful COEX system underlying this disorder. The biographical part of \nthis constellation might consist of a memory of near drowning at the age of seven, memories of being repeatedly strangled b y an older brother between the ages of three \nand four, and a memory of severe choking during whooping cough or diphtheria at the age of two. The perinatal contribution to this COEX could be, for example, suffo-cation experienced during birth because of stra ngulation by the umbilical cord twisted \naround the neck. A typical transpersonal root of this breathing disorder would be an experience of being hanged or strangled in what seems to be a previous lifetime.\u201d  \n(Grof 2012: 150)  \n \nIn repeating an experience under the controlled conditions of a psychedelic \nsession, Grof believes that the negative impact of the experience can be  Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion  | 257 \n discharged and thereby neutralized. The therapeutic use of this mechanism \nwill be discussed in more detail below. \nIn his research with LSD, Grof thus observed that those who had experi-\nenced autobiographical content in their psychedelic sessions were increas-\ningly confronted with other complexes at deeper levels, such as mortality, \nphysical pain, emotional agony, aging and, finally, death. The most im-portant element of this process is that on each occasion the images are per-ceived as extremely realistic and completely comparable to the real process of dying (Grof/Grof: 1980: 25). The relationship to the topic of NDEs be-comes clear at this point. Grof expresses this explicitly at the end of his study \nEncounter with Death . He writes: \n \n\u201cIndividuals  who experience the encounter  with death  in psychedelic  sessions fre-\nquently report  that it feels  extremely  authentic  and convincing,  to the point  of being \nindistinguishable  from  actual  dying.  Many  descriptions  of changes  of consciousness  \nin persons  facing  situations  of vital emergency  or experiencing  clinical  death exist  in \nautobiographical  accounts,  novels,  and poetry,  but this area has been surprisingly  ne-\nglected  by psychiatrists  and psychologists.  There  are only a few studies in which  this \ninteresting  field has been  systematically  explored.  We will briefly summarize  the \nwork  that has been done,  illustrate  it with subjective  accounts  of survivors,  and relate \nit to our observations  from  psychedelic research .\u201d (Grof/Halifax 1977: 131)  \n \nAt this point, it becomes clear how Grof thinks of the relationship between \nLSD experiences and NDEs: they are caused by the same mechanisms of the human psyche that become active when the normal state is ruptured by some-thing or intentionally changed. This can happen through the use of drugs, as well as in situations of extreme threat to life or through certain techniques, such as the holotropic breathwork that Grof developed with his wife after \nLSD was banned. This also shows that Grof does not see the drug as causing  \nthe experience, but as making it visible  and accessible . The possible paths to \nsuch experiences are many and in his writings, Grof draws manifold com-\nparisons to induce extraordinary states of consciousness. Later, in their 1980 publication Beyond Death, Stanislav Grof and his wife Christina write : \n  \n\u201cThere are striking parallels between Moody's observations and descriptions from es-\nchatological literature, particularly the Bardo states in the Tibetan Book of the Dead. \nSimilar if not identical elements occur in psychedelic sessions when the subjects 258 | Stephanie Gripentrog   \n experience deep confrontation with death in the context of the death \u2014rebirth process. \nAs we shall see in a later sectio n, there are also correspondences with spontaneously \noccurring states experienced by some schizophrenic patients.\u201d  (Grof/Grof 1980: 13)  \n \nHere, Grof and Grof compare various aspects directly with each other, de-\nscribing them as \u201csimilar\u201d or \u201cidentical:\u201d Moody\u2019s research results on NDEs and his descriptions of their eschatological character; Buddhist ways of con-frontation with death, as in the context of the Tibetan Book of the Dead; and episodes in the experiences of schizophrenics. The images that appear in this context correspond to the cartographies of extraordinary states of conscious-\nness that every human being can potentially experience, as mentioned earlier. \nAt this point, the question of the ontological status of the objects of such experiences becomes of particular interest. In the spirit of James, Grof writes that they are experienced as being on a special level of reality. And, like James, Grof concludes: \n \n\u201cModern studies of holotropic states [...] have shown that Heaven, Paradise, and Hell \nare ontolo gically real; they represent distinct and important states of consciousness \nthat all human beings can under certain circumstances experience during their life-time. Celestial, paradisean, and infernal visions are a standard part of the experiential spectrum  of psychedelic inner journeys, near -death states, mystical experiences, as \nwell as shamanic initiatory crises and other types of \u2018spiritual emergencies\u2019.\u201d (Grof \n2012: 157)  \n \nThus, heaven and hell are real, but in the sense of specific states of conscious-ness, not as external places. However, unlike James, Grof moves one step further. While James, at least in his writings on religious experience, does not go beyond the subjective certainty of others, only observing and describ-\ning from the outside (which is all too clearly expressed in his formulation \n\u201cwho apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may con-\nsider the divine\u201d (James 1902: 32)), Grof ascribes priority to consciousness \nover matter when he says: \n \n\u201cMaterialistic science has not been a ble to produce any convincing evidence that con-\nsciousness is a product of the neurophysiological processes in the brain. It has been \nable to maintain its present position only by ignoring, misinterpreting, and even ridi-culing a vast body of observations in dicating that consciousness can exist and function  Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion  | 259 \n independently of the body and of the physical senses. This evidence comes from par-\napsychology, anthropology, LSD research, experiential psychotherapy, thanatology, and the study of spontaneously occurring holotropic states of consciousness. All these \ndisciplines have amassed impressive data demonstrating clearly that human con-\nsciousness is capable of doing many things that the brain (as understood by main-\nstream science) could not possibly do and that it is a primary and further irreducible \naspect of existence.\u201d  (Grof 2012: 145 \u2013146) \n \nConsciousness itself thus becomes the primary factor of existence. In adopt-\ning this proposition, Grof can be aligned with authors of more recent research \non NDEs, such as Pim van Lommel (2010) and Eben Alexander, (2012) who \nalso assume the possibility of a body-independent consciousness and con-sider this to be the only plausible explanation of the NDE phenomenon. But it is not only these three authors who share this approach. Rather, their argu-mentation is part of a much broader movement within contemporary religi-osity, on which I shall elaborate in the next section. \n  \n5  ON THE THERAPEUTIC R ELEVANCE OF  \nNEAR- DEATH EXPERIENCES \n \nAs a trained psychoanalyst, Grof's interest in LSD had initially been predom-inantly therapeutic. He and other researchers in the field hoped that the use of the drug in a therapeutic setting under controlled conditions would provide a cure for schizophrenia and alcoholism. His research with cancer patients and, resulting from it, with depressive patients also demonstrated the drug\u2019s \nhigh degree of effectiveness in helping people cope with the fact of approach-ing death: \n \n\u201cAccording  to our observations,  those  individuals  who have  experienced  death and \nrebirth  in their sessions  show  specific  changes  in their perception of themselves  and \nof the world,  in their hierarchies  of values,  general  behavior,  and overall  world -views.  \nThose  who prior  to these  experiences  had various  forms  and degrees  of emotional  and \npsychosomatic  discomfort  usually  feel greatly  relieved.  Depression  dissolves,  anxiety  \nand tension  are reduced,  guilt  feelings  are lifted, and self-image  as well as self-ac-\nceptance improve  considerably.  Individuals  talk about  experiencing  themselves  as 260 | Stephanie Gripentrog   \n reborn  and purified;  a deep sense  of being in tune with nature  and the universe  replaces  \ntheir  previous  feelings  of alienation .\u201d (Grof/Halifax 1977: 210)  \n \nOn the basis of these findings, later, when LSD was banned, Stanislav and \nChristina Grof developed the technique of holotropic breathwork as a substi-\ntute and introduced it as a new form of therapy. Grof sees in this a modern form of transitional ritual, using the same vocabulary as the French ethnolo-gist Arnold van Gennep: separation\u2014liminality \u2014incorporation,\n8 and he as-\ncribes great therapeutic relevance to it. In all cultures, Grof and Grof write in Beyond Death, there are certain rituals that have this function: \n \n\u201cHowever, repeated encounters with annihilation followed by a sense of redefinition \nhave another important function: they prepare the individual for eventual biological death by establishing a deep, almost cellular awareness that periods of destruction are those of transition rather than termination.\u201d (1980: 23)  \n \nAccording to Grof, these rituals, for instance therapeutic sessions, prepare \npeople to deal with death. Thus, in such sessions, the area of the sensory barrier is first crossed, followed by experiences of biographical content. Af-ter that, one enters the domain in which experiences of death and rebirth are made. Those who engage in holotropic breathing will sooner or later be con-fronted with this area. In all cases, it is important not only to observe, but to \nlive through  experiences of problematic content again, including in the phys-\nical sense, because that is what causes the therapeutic effect. Ultimately, this \nalso applies to one\u2019s own death, which is already a structural part of the car-tography of the psyche as a potential experience. \nThis is why Grof and Halifax say: \u201c It is hard to imagine a more useful \nway to combine medicine, psychology, and religion than psychedelic therapy \nwith dying individuals.\u201d (1977: 24) However, the technique of holotropic \nbreathwork is relevant not only for the sick or those in need of therapy. With the discovery of these structures in human consciousness, Grof claims noth-ing less than to have found the decisive key to the actual constitution of re-ality, the understanding of religious history, as well as of mental illnesses and the transformation of psychotherapeutic treatments, which he then \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n8  Cp. v an Gennep  (1909) . Grof and Grof refer to van Gennep in  Beyond Death  \n(1980: 22).  Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion  | 261 \n qualifies as \u201ctechnologies of the sacred\u201d. (Grof 2012: 139) Grof\u2019s  claim is \nthus all-encompassing, and he sees in his psychology the \u201cpsychology of the \nfuture\u201d (cp. 2000). \nSince 1987, when Grof founded Grof Transpersonal Training as a \u201cpsy-\ncho-spiritual practice,\u201d he and his team have been training people in this ther-apeutic technique. The courses (cp. www.holotropic.com, 04 July, 2018) they teach consist of seven six-day modules, which the trainees have to at-tend. Each of the modules to be visited has a thematic motto, of which four are compulsory: \u201cThe Power Within,\u201d \u201cMusic and Transcendence,\u201d \u201cThe Holotropic Paradigm,\u201d and \u201cSpiritual Emergency\u201d (Grof 2017: 4). In addi-\ntion, ten actual experiences with holotropic breathwork during workshops \nled by certified leaders and another ten individual sessions are mandatory. On the basis of this, the trainees must assist at least four times in the relevant workshops. Whoever has gained two more years of experience with holo-tropic breathwork and attended the final two-week intensive course receives a certificate. Even then, certain obligations remain to be met regularly to en-\nsure the quality of the work in the long term, on pain of losing one\u2019s certifi-\ncate (Ibid: 6). Grof makes it very clear in the letter accompanying the training \napplication forms that the technology itself is easy to learn, but that as a leader or companion you must have special competences that require long-term learning: \n \n\u201cTo be able to effectively facilitate Holotropic sessions for others, we often have to \ngo through a very profound personal transformation that has emotional, psychologi-cal, philosophical, and spiritual dimensions. As you train to be Holotropic Breathwork facilitators, we as k you to work toward the capacity to remain unperturbed while \nproviding support for people in all possible forms of non -ordinary states of conscious-\nness, toward the ability to follow them wherever they have to go in their experiences, \nand toward maintainin g trust in the intrinsic healing forces in them.\u201d (Ibid: 16)  \n \nIn addition to the American organization (cp. www.holotropic.com, July 4, \n2018), a separate network, the \u201cEuropean Association for Holotropic Breath-work,\u201d was founded. The organization\u2019s website describes the therapy as a \u201cpowerful technique for self-healing and self-exploration allowing for \ngreater self-understanding, expansion of self-identity and access to the roots 262 | Stephanie Gripentrog   \n of emotional and psychosomatic challenges one might face.\u201d9 The countries \nin which training is currently available are Australia, Austria, Brazil, the \nCzech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. Apart from \nthis certified training, the technique of holotropic breathwork is also offered \nindependently. One example is Sylvester Walch (cp. 2012), who was trained by Grof but developed the method further independently of him and has pub-lished a lot on the subject. \nA website associated with the Grof Transpersonal Training  website \nstates that there are currently five hundred people worldwide who are certi-\nfied in the technique of holotropic breathwork.\n10 It is unclear how accurate \nthis information is\u2014statistical surveys on the actual dissemination of the \npractice worldwide do not yet exist. However, random samples for Germany show that there are people in the alternative medicine sector\n11 who not only \noffer holotropic breathwork as a form of treatment but also train others in it. \nIn fact, LSD has itself recently moved back into the focus not only of \nsocial and therapeutic interest, but also of scientific interest. This is currently shown by various research projects on LSD and related substances such as psilocybin,\n12 which again not only highlight its extraordinary effect on the \nhuman brain, (Nutt et al. 2016: 4853\u20134858) but also its therapeutic relevance. It may therefore be assumed that this research topic is undergoing a renais-sance. Organizations such as the Multidisciplinary Association for Psyche-\ndelic Studies  (www.maps.org, May 8, 2018), founded in 1986 as a non-profit \norganization and based on donations, have supported this renaissance for many years and taken it further. Moreover, events like the World Psychedelic \nForum in Basle (March 21\u201324, 2008), the conference Horizons: Perspectives \non Psychedelics (Oct 6 \u20138, 2017) in New York and the International \nTranspersonal Conference 2017 (Sept 28\u2013Oct 1, 2017) in Prague clearly \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n9 http://www.holotropic -association.eu/breathwork/what -is-holotropic- breathwork, \nMay 8, 2018.  \n10  Cp. http://www.grof -holotropic -breathwork.de/verwandt.html , May 8, 2018 . \n11 A probably incomplete  list of therapists in Germany can be found at: \nhttps://www.therapeuten.de/therapien/holotropes_atmen.htm#anbieter , May 8, \n2018. \n12  On the latest research, including the effect s of LSD on cancer patients , cp. Grif-\nfiths et al. 2016:  1181 \u20131197.   Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion  | 263 \n demonstrate the public presence of the topic. What kind of impact these ini-\ntiatives may have on the future of the rapidly developing branch of palliative care remains to be seen. \nFinally, with regard to the therapeutic dimension, there is an overlap be-\ntween research on LSD and NDEs.\n13 Not only do LSD experiences and NDEs \nshow striking similarities phenomenologically, in the field of TP they also seem to have similar psychological consequences for those affected, as re-peatedly reported in the form of the loss of fear of death or of a changed view of oneself and the world.\n14 In the form of the technique of holotropic breath-\nwork, the experience of dying, death, and rebirth also has a place today on \nthe German therapy and counselling scene, although exact data are currently \nstill lacking. In addition, Grof\u2019s early research on terminally ill cancer pa-tients also demonstrates its claim of potential relevance for end-of-life care. \n  \n6  TRANSPERESONAL PSYCH OLOGY BETWEEN \nSCIENCE AND RELIGION  \n What is special about the question of the relationship between psychol-ogy/psychiatry in the case of TP and NDEs is that Transpersonal Psychology \nseems to play a twofold role. On the one hand, it is a means to establish an \nallegedly scientific perspective on the topic of NDEs. On the other hand, psychology\u2014in the form of TP, for example\u2014itself becomes entangled with the religious field through certain therapeutic practices and the exploitation of patterns of scientific plausibility to religious ends. This is probably why \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n13  Roland Griffiths, who conducted research on the effects of LSD on cancer patients  \n(see above: Griffiths  et al. 2016 ), set up a new project in 2 015, collecting data \nabout people who had an NDE or some other non -ordinary experience that fun-\ndamentally altered their beliefs or under standing about death and dying, the re-\nsults of which are not yet published  (cp. http://www.drpennysartori.com/NDE%  \n20death%20flyer.pdf , May 08, 2018) . In an earlier interview from 2006, Griffiths \nalso pointed out the parallels between his r esearch on psilocybin and NDEs ( cp. \nhttps://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Press_releases/2006/GriffithspsilocybinQ , \nMay 08, 2018).  \n14  Such results have, for instance, been reported in a  recent study on NDEs and their \nrelation to spiritual well-being (Khanna/Greyson 2014: 1605 \u20131615).  264 | Stephanie Gripentrog   \n the inventor of LSD, Albert Hofmann, said in an interview that psychiatrists \nare the \u201ccurative priests\u201d of contemporary society.15 And Stanislav Grof too \nspeaks of the \u201cre-enchantment\u201d of psychology in one of his recent publica-tions in which he looks back at the last fifty years of consciousness research \n(cp. 2012). It therefore seems logical to read this case as a typical example \nof what Wouter Hanegraaff has described as \u201cNew Age religiosity\u201d and the \u201cpsychologization of religion and sacralization of psychology\u201d (Hanegraaff 1998: 514). \nWhat TP offers from the alternative and complementary medical/thera-\npeutic area in particular, to which Grof can be ascribed, generates an increas-\ning resonance on the customer side. Thus, regardless of how they might be \nassessed scientifically, they obviously play a role in some parts of society that should not be underestimated. \nAt any rate, this movement can best be characterized as programmatically \ntransboundary, and as such it may seem more attractive than ever to many people, precisely because  it claims to be both scientific and religious. More-\nover, it stands apart from the institutionally established forms of religion and offers a radically individualized form of access to the beyond which requires no mediator. Grof writes as follows about this with reference to C.G. Jung: \n \n\u201cAs he saw it in his later years, the psyche is not a product of the brain and is not \ncontained in the skull; it is the creative and generative principle of the cosmos ( anima \nmundi ). It permeates all of existence and the individual psyche of each of us is teased \nout of this unfathomable cosmic matrix. The boundaries between the anima mundi  \nand the individual psyche are not absolute; they are permeable and can be transcended in holotropic states.\u201d (2012: 154)  \n \nNot only does this type of psychology represent a clear rejection of the ma-\nterialistic paradigm in science, it also claims to open up a path for the con-\nnection of the individual psyche with the anima mundi  and the process of \nman becoming one with the cosmos. \n \n  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n15  Cp. http://www.bpv.ch/blog/albert -hofmann -interview/ , May 08, 2018.   Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion  | 265 \n 7  CONCLUSION  \n \nThe aim of this paper has been to analyze a striking development in the con-\ntemporary religious landscape, namely the \u201creligionization\u201d of scientific dis-\ncourse as manifest in research on Near-Death Experiences in Transpersonal Psychology as a specific, marginal part of psychology and psychiatry. This development has been analyzed by focusing on one of its most important representatives, the psychiatrist Stanislav Grof. Overall, four concluding ob-servations can be made. \nFirst, the distinction between science and religion is once again im-\npugned and re-negotiated in the field of Transpersonal Psychology. As such, these cases are a good example of what Burkhard Gladigow, in his highly quoted text on European religious history, has described as the \u201cvertical transfer\u201d of results of the humanities and natural sciences into the realm of \u201creligion\u201d (1995: 21).  In the case of both holotropic breathwork as well as \npsychological approaches to Near-Death Experiences (NDE), research that claims to be scientific  becomes productive of religious imaginary. \nSecondly, even though TP may be a contested branch of psychology, \nthere have been noticeable changes within \u201corthodox\u201d psychology in dealing with religion and spirituality as well. This observation helps to further con-textualize the case at hand. In Germany, for example, a re-evaluation of top-\nics related to religion and spirituality can be observed in the fields of psy-\nchology and psychiatry. This development has already been called \u201cthe spir-itual turn.\u201d  \u201cHaving been tabooed [\u2026] and polemically devalued [\u2026], recent \npublications on religious psychology have registered a remarkable change of direction [\u2026]\u201d (Utsch 2002: 68). For example, a survey of more than nine \nhundred German psychotherapists in 2011 revealed \u201c[\u2026] that spirituality and \nreligiosity seem to be relevant to the majority of psychological psychothera-\npists in Germany\u201d (Utsch 2002: 69). More than half of them said \u201c[\u2026] that their personal spiritual or religious orientation strongly (8 per cent), fairly (21 per cent) or moderately (27 per cent) affects their psychotherapeutic ac-tivity\u201d (Ibid: 69). Thus, quite independently of the special case of TP or of specific client and patient demands, a notable trend to integrate spirituality \nor religiosity can be observed in the broader fields of psychology, psychiatry, \nand psychotherapy. \nThirdly, this whole development can be situated in the wider context of \nresearch on the \u201ctherapeutization of society,\u201d (cp. Anhorn/Balzereit 2016; 266 | Stephanie Gripentrog   \n Maasen et al. 2011). Therapeutization means, according to Anhorn and \nBalzereit, the diffusion, spreading, and generalization of highly individual-ized and self-referential methods and techniques of everyday life and prob-lem solving, accelerated under the conditions of the neo-liberal social for-\nmation (2016: XVII). This description of the diffusion of therapeutic meth-\nods cannot be discussed in detail here. Such a diffusion will, however, not remain without influence on religion. From a theoretical point of view, one aspect seems particularly interesting, namely the religious productivity  of \ntherapy itself. In this way, therapeutic approaches, same as for instance holo-tropic breathwork, are at times deliberately designed to induce transpersonal \nexperiences that can be effective in healing. Detached from a definite, clearly \nidentifiable religious tradition, these specific forms of therapy can become an extraordinarily powerful medium for religion. The \u201cre-sacralization\u201d of psychology, the orientation of mainstream psychology and psychotherapy towards religious and spiritual questions, and finally the \u201ctherapeutization\u201d of society are therefore important factors in contemporary western religious \nhistory. \nFinally, the aspect of somatization is crucial in current re-configurations \nof religion(s). In an anthology on the \u201csomatization of the religious\u201d pub-\nlished in 2015, Gritt Klinkhammer and Eva Tolksdorf point out that religion and spirituality have become enormously important in the research- based \nand application-oriented secular health sector in recent years, alongside an \nincrease in the supply of and demand for religious and spiritualist-oriented \ntherapies in the alternative and complementary medical field, in religious and spiritual communities, and in the esoteric field. Within the current state of research, questions of the effect this development may have had on new un-derstandings of \u201cbody\u201d, \u201creligion\u201d, and \u201chealth\u201d, on potentially novel ways of religious (self-)organization and communitarization, as well as on for-\nmations of religious authenticity and authority remain unanswered \n(Klinkhammer/Tolksdorf 2015: 3\u20134). \nThe topic of NDEs seems to be a paradigmatic case here, in which dying, \neven if \u201conly\u201d perceived psychologically, is always a physical event. From the point of view of therapists such as Grof, who deliberately induced such processes, they are always both psychological and physical events at the \nsame time. This method is characterized by the fact that a psychic experience \nalways implies a physical one, and that it is only by involving both that heal-ing becomes possible. As mentioned in the passage from Klinkhammer and  Mapping the Boundaries between Science and Religion  | 267 \n Tolksdorf quoted above, this further implies a specific view of religious au-\nthenticity and authority: authenticity is constituted by the individual experi-ence of the clients, and therapists are solely companions of a process that is basically autonomous. Developments such as these change the social config-\nuration of the field. This is why Klinkhammer and Tolksdorf predict that the \nnew processes of somatization in the religious field will re-establish charis-matic communitarization, as well as retroactively affect traditional forms of religion(s). This understanding could generate in-depth questions about new processes of religious authorization by means of \u201cthe body\u201d and \u201chealing\u201d and new communitarization dynamics in the face of a charismatic healing \nrelationship. The practice of healing is by no means limited to the religious \nvirtuosi, as there is a definite tendency to duplication and individuation. These developments therefore raise questions about changes in the under-standing of roles, the relationship between religious clients and healers, and the dynamics of the healing process  (ibid: 7\u20138). \nIn the case of both holotropic breathwork and NDEs, the individual ex-\nperience is itself meant to cause  the healing. These are therefore exactly the \ntendencies towards duplication and individuation that Klinkhammer and Tolksdorf speak of. What is new here, above all, is the connection with the aspect of healing, which is both physical and psychical at the same time and is put back into the hands of the clients themselves as a process of self-heal-ing. Therapists are solely companions in these processes or temporary teach-\ners in therapeutic techniques, which are never limited to them as \u201cvirtuosi \u201d. \nWhat kinds of new communities are emerging from these constellations? \nHow are they changing the religious field?\n16 What widespread effects are \nsuch developments exerting in view of the \u201ctherapeutization of society\u201d and \nthe \u201cspiritual turn\u201d in psychology and psychotherapy? Research is just about to start at this point. \n \n \nBIBLIOGRAPHY  \n Alexander, Eben (2012): Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon\u2019s Journey into \nthe Afterlife, New York: Simon & Schuster. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n16  Related to this is the question of the influence of NDEs on current \u201c spiritual \nworldviews\u201d ( cp.
