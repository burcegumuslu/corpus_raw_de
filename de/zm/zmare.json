{"title": "A Proposal for a System of Classification for Anthroposophic Meditation", "author": "Sparby; Terje", "url": "https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000503893", "hostname": "doi.org", "description": "Abstract. Background: The investigation of the specific connections between different techniques of meditation and their respective effects depends upon a classification of the meditative activity involved. Universal systems of classification need to be developed based both on traditional sources and contemporary science. In this article, a system of classification for anthroposophical meditation is proposed. Methods: The system was developed from a close textual analysis of meditation instructions given by Rudolf Steiner. The system of classification arising from the investigation was compared to three other classificatory systems that have recently been suggested. Results: The analysis resulted in a system of classification with two main branches: (1) the shared features of anthroposophical meditation and (2) the different aspects of specific anthroposophical meditations. The first branch contains the following sub-categories: understanding, internal conditions, external conditions, sequence, timeframe and dealing with hindrances. The second branch contains: source, aim, activity, sequence and timeframe. Other systems of classification tend to leave out the dimension of the meditative activity. Conclusion: The proposed classification system can be used as a starting point for further refinements of the classification of anthroposophic meditation, but it can also be used as a standard for future studies of the connections between different meditations and their effects.", "sitename": "Karger Publishers", "date": "2020-04-27", "id": null, "license": null, "body": null, "comments": "", "commentsbody": null, "raw_text": null, "text": "Abstract\nBackground: The investigation of the specific connections between different techniques of meditation and their respective effects depends upon a classification of the meditative activity involved.
