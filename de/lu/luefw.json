He is thus considered the founder of active immunisation. By administering weakened or dead pathogens, or fragments thereof, the [immune system](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/immune-system/) of the vaccinated individual is stimulated to form [antibodies](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/antibodies/). Conversely, passive immunisation involves the administration of previously prepared [antibodies](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/antibodies/). These \u201cpost-exposition-prophylaxes\u201d are given to patients, for example, after they have been bitten by animals suspected of being infected with rabies.\nMost vaccines are injected into a muscle. Usually, the\n[antigens](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/antigens/) that are supposed to elicit the immune response are administered directly. Vector and mRNA vaccines, on the other hand, contain the genetic blueprint for the antigen, which is produced by the body cells that have absorbed the vaccines. The basis for the activation of the [immune system](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/immune-system/) are specialised immune cells - the antigen-presenting cells. These sit in the tissue and, once they have recognised foreign structures, migrate to the lymph nodes - the control centres of the [immune system](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/immune-system/). After [vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/), the antigen-presenting cells trigger an alarm in the [immune system](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/immune-system/). They release various signalling substances and place fragments of the antigen on their surface. In this way, they show the B and [T cells](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/t-cells/) who the invader is that needs to be fought off.\nThese cell types form the two arms of the acquired\n[immune system](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/immune-system/), the cellular arm with [T cells](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/t-cells/) and the humoral arm with [B cells](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/b-cells/). A subpopulation of the T-cells is specialised in seeking out and destroying virus-infected body cells so that the virus cannot reproduce further. [B cells](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/b-cells/) produce [antibodies](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/antibodies/) against antigen that was given by [vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/). These spread throughout the body with the blood and render invading pathogens harmless. By activating both [T cells](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/t-cells/) and [B cells](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/b-cells/), vaccinations promise good and lasting protection against disease.\nSome time after\n[vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/), the reaction subsides. However, vaccinated people retain [antibodies](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/antibodies/) in their blood for a long time, as well as some T and [B cells](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/b-cells/) that remember and can react quickly when they are really infected with the pathogen. [B cells](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/b-cells/) then turn back into highly productive factories for [antibodies](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/antibodies/) when an alarm signal is given. [T cells](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/t-cells/) are activated to seek out infected cells.\nThe direct link between\n[vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/) and disease control can be observed very well in Germany.\u201cOral [vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/) is sweet \u2013 infantile paralysis is terrible\u201d \u2013 this slogan was used in the Federal Republic of Germany as an advertisement for poliomyelitis oral [vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/). As proof of its great success, the number of those infected in Germany decreased, according to data from the Paul Ehrlich Institute, from more than 5,600 in 1961 to less than 300 in the first year after the introduction of the [vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/). Nowadays, Germany, as well as the rest of Europe, is considered to be [polio](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/polio/)-free and the [vaccine](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccine/) is one component of a combination immunisation.\nIn 2014, only Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pakistan remain\n[polio](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/polio/)- [endemic](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/endemic/). Where infantile [polio](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/polio/) has not yet been conquered, it continues to be administered in liquid form. Consequently, no new needle is required for each individual to be vaccinated, nor are specifically-trained medical personnel necessary. This is ideal in regions of the world in which the nearest hospital can be a few hundred kilometres away.\nThis is also the case for a kind of\n[vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/) which is currently being developed by researchers at the HZI: The [vaccine](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccine/) is in this case administered as a nasal spray. This means the immune reaction can take place directly in the nasal [mucous membrane](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/mucous-membrane/), where many pathogens would also enter into the body later on. This form of [vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/) needs no painful \u201cprick\u201d of the needle, which is feared by many and can even cause them to shirk vaccinations altogether. This [vaccine](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccine/) fatigue is problematic, as only a high number of vaccinated individuals among the population leads to a so-called \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Pathogens can hardly be disseminated further, thus there is also protection for those who weren\u2019t able to be vaccinated and for those whose vaccinations failed, e.g. individuals with pre-existing diseases or immune-defects, or children prior to [vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/).\nFor\n[measles](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/measles/), Germany has introduced a mandatory [vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/) for some groups of people in 2020. It applies to children from the age of one when they enter kindergarten or school and to employees of social or medical institutions (e.g. educators, teachers, medical staff).\nAn annually recurring\n[vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/) is that against [influenza](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/influenza/). The [influenza](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/influenza/) virus that triggers this disease is able to change its surface structures very quickly. This makes it difficult for our [immune system](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/immune-system/) to recognise and eliminate new variants of these viruses. New virus variants, against which we have no immunity, emerge about every two to three years. The [vaccine](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccine/) must therefore be adapted to the new variants every year. After [vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/), it takes about 14 days for the [vaccine](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccine/) protection to build up. The [STIKO ](https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/infections/Vaccination/Vaccination_node.html;jsessionid=645F8E7002BEF0539D1DEFDCA185D3D1.internet051)(Standing Committee on Vaccination at the Robert Koch Institute) recommends the annual flu [vaccination](/en/info-centre/glossary/entry/vaccination/) for all people over 60 years of age, for people with chronic illnesses that make it more likely that they will contract the flu or that its course may be more severe, as well as for medical and nursing staff.\n(bma, Ulrike Schneewei\u00df)\nFurther Information:\n[Information regarding the Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr gesundheitliche Aufkl\u00e4rung (BZgA) on the topic of vaccinations](http://www.impfen-info.de/) [Recommendations by the St\u00e4ndige Impfkommission (STIKO) at the Robert Koch Institute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb7TVW77ZCs) [The operation of vaccination described by \"Technology, Entertainment, Design\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb7TVW77ZCs) [Interview of the \u201c](http://www.helmholtz.de/gesundheit/jetzt-ist-der-beste-zeitpunkt-fuer-die-impfung-4826/) [Helmholtz Gemeinschaft\u201d with G\u00e9rard Krause regarding vaccinations](http://www.helmholtz.de/gesundheit/jetzt-ist-der-beste-zeitpunkt-fuer-die-impfung-4826/)\nAudio Podcast\n- Ein neuer Impfstoff gegen Tuberkulose \u2013 die Infektion Nr. 1 in der WeltAlle 15 Sekunden stirbt ein Mensch an Tuberkulose.
