Such information may be found in manuscript and printed scores, mechanical or electrical recording devices, music and dance treatises, books and letters, media accounts and visual documentation of concert settings, instrument designs and TEMPERAMENTS, and so on. A temporal art, live music can only manifest itself in ever-varied performances, yet it \u201cremains unchanged behind this relativity\u201d (Rosen). The relationship between the absolute and the relative aspects of music constitutes the basic concern of performance practice. Depending on the resolution of this relationship, two orientations have evolved. The first asserts the inherent value of the past, seen as a repository of the composer\u2019s intentions, and hence the source of presumably immutable truths about proper musical performance. By contrast, the second orientation affirms the all-important contribution of the present, seen not necessarily as a corrupting factor but rather as a re-creative one without whose impulse music would ossify into a lifeless repetition of the past. The three major topics of performance practice\u2014notation, perception, and instruments\u2014will be treated from the often conflicting perspectives of the two orientations, and exemplified by findings of contemporary research.\nBased on a combination of research methods and traditions, this three-part study presents a survey of the present state of knowledge about the production and ownership of deluxe manuscripts in the late-medieval Netherlands. Part One is based on the analysis of a corpus of about 3,700 extant illustrated manuscripts produced between 1400 and 1550 in the (northern and southern) Low Countries. The composition of this corpus made it possible to glean general information about many aspects of manuscripts production, such as chronological and geographical distribution, the various kinds of texts, dimensions, the languages used, and the relationship with the production of printed books. Substantial consideration is given to the methodological problem of the extent to which we can state that what we are discussing is also a faithful reflection of what was originally produced. The cautious conclusion is that surviving illustrated manuscripts might represent 20% of all those originally made. Compared to estimates for the survival of other objects this is an extremely high proportion. Part Two revolves around the leading owners of illustrated manuscripts in the Netherlands \u2013 the ducal family and the noble elite. The libraries of the Burgundian dukes and those of the foremost noble families are analysed by means of inventories and surviving manuscripts. In the wake of the great bibliophile duke Philip the Good we see the appearance among members of the noble elite born between 1420 and 1435 of a sort of fashion in book ownership. The many deluxe manuscripts they commissioned were typically \u2018Burgundian\u2019 in both outward aspect and content. In this respect they differ from the books owned by the lower court functionaries \u2013 the parvenus \u2013 who often sprang from burgher stock. We see how, by the building of a certain sort of library, a small elite demonstrated a group identity. This can be interpreted in the light of the \u2018Burgundianizing\u2019 of the Netherlands: under Philip the Good and Charles the Bold the noble elites of the various principalities were gradually transformed into a supra-regional group. Cultural expressions such as the acquisition of magnificent manuscripts played a role in this process. Part Three draw conclusions from the two former parts and enlarge the discussion. The (book owning) people as well as the manuscripts are part of society and both play their part in political, religious, social, economic and cultural life of the later medieval Low Countries. As an appendix to this book, a database containing information on some 3700 illustrated Netherlandish manuscripts (1400-1550) is published on the web: http://www.cn-telma.fr/luxury-bound/\n2007\nDas Motiv einer Gemeinschaft mit den Engeln im Gottesdienst l\u00e4sst sich in fr\u00fchj\u00fcdischen und neutestamentlichen Texten finden. Michael R. Jost untersucht erstmals alle Belege aus Qumran und dem Neuen Testament exegetisch und diskutiert sie im Kontext traditionsgeschichtlicher Entwicklungen ausgehend von alttestamentlichen Aspekten bis hin zu rabbinischen und fr\u00fchchristlichen Perspektiven. Besondere Ber\u00fccksichtigung erfahren die liturgischen Texte, deren Wirkung auch in performativer Perspektive untersucht wird, womit nach der im Gottesdienst erfahrenen Gemeinschaft gefragt wird. Damit bietet der Autor neue Einsichten sowohl f\u00fcr die Qumran Forschung in der Analyse der liturgischen Gemeinschaft des ya\u1e25ad, als auch f\u00fcr die neutestamentliche Forschung und das urchristliche Gottesdienstverst\u00e4ndnis. Communion with Angels in Earthly Worship. Studies on Qumran and New Testament Texts. The motif of liturgical communion with angels appears in early Jewish and New Testament texts. Michael R. Jost offers the first exegetical analysis of all relevant passages from the Dead Sea Scrolls and the New Testament and places them within traditio-historical developments from the Hebrew Bible to rabbinical and patristic texts. By giving special consideration to the respective performances of liturgical texts, the author reconstructs each groups\u2019 experience of angelic communion. In his analysis of the liturgical communion of the ya\u1e25ad, Jost presents new insights not only for Qumran research but also for New Testament scholarship and the understanding of the early Christian communities and communal liturgies.\n2015\nDie vom Menschen verursachte globale Naturkrise fordert die Frage nach dem Verh\u00e4ltnis von Mensch und Natur seit l\u00e4ngerem heraus. Zur Debatte steht auch der revisionsbed\u00fcrftige Einfluss biblischer Dogmen (\u201eMacht euch die Erde untertan\u201c) auf naturvergessene Lebens orientierungen und Verhaltensweisen. Die wechselseitige \u00dcbersetzungsarbeit dieses Buches verbindet heutige Naturethik mit einer Neulekt\u00fcre der Sch\u00f6pfungserz\u00e4hlung von Genesis 1 und er\u00f6ffnet einen Dialog zwischen bibelbezogener Fr\u00f6mmigkeit und s\u00e4kularer Naturethik, der auch in religionsphilosophischer Hinsicht wesentlich \u00fcber das traditionelle Gottesverst\u00e4ndnis hinausgeht. Der Br\u00fcckenschlag f\u00fchrt im Rahmen einer nachmetaphysischen Gott-Bezogenheit zu einem Neuverst\u00e4ndnis der Natur als Sch\u00f6pfung und des Menschen als kohabitatives Naturwesen, das trotz seiner Fragw\u00fcrdigkeit und Prekarit\u00e4t im stets erneuerungsbed\u00fcrftigen Sch\u00f6pfungsvertrauen f\u00e4hig ist, mit Lust und Freude seine fundamentale Verantwortung f\u00fcr die naturgegebenen und von ihm bedrohten Lebensgrundlagen achtsam und dankbar wahrzunehmen.\n2017\nMyth is one of the most powerful forms the human mind has developed to make sense of the world. This volume starts from Cassirer's idea of myth as symbolic form that follows a genuine kind of logic. It takes ancient Japanese mythologies as an example to explore this idea and take it beyond the notion, still held by Cassirer, of the primitivity of myth. Ancient Japanese mythologies select, grasp and order their objects in accordance with a discernible rational agenda, and they interact with each other and with other symbolic forms present at the time. Their analysis thus reveals important clues about the way mythology operates as a genuine form of \u00bbworldmaking\u00bb in concert and conflict with other modes of making sense.\n2008\nThis book examines the role of literate medicine in shaping women's access to medical learning and medical care in the high Middle Ages.

The analysis is set against the earlier political and ideological history of these languages, and the panorama of the emergence and political uses of other languages of the region. Reviews: 'Kamusella has produced a magisterial study, ambitious in its aims but supported by original research as well as offering a synthesis of specialized contributions in a number of languages. The concepts it uses and the conclusions it reaches about language and politics can be expected to provoke a more general discussion. It is likely to remain the standard work in its field for a generation.' - from the Foreword by Peter Burke, Emeritus Professor of Cultural History, University of Cambridge, UK 'Truly extraordinary is the author's detalied command of history, philology, and the national languages involved in this study. For those seeking information on language modernization in Central Europe or on case studies on the politics of language, this book is an excellent choice.' - Patrick Heinrich, International Journal of the Sociology of Language 'A magnificent history of language politics...Kamusella's book is an illustration of its own core argument: scholarship on language serves social purposes. Every EU official and NGO activist who deals with East Central Europe should have this book to hand, and every graduate seminar on nationalism in the region should begin with it. It provides countless sound judgements, and dispenses with a tremendous amount of nonsense.' - Timothy Snyder, Times Literary Supplement 'Apart from being an exceptional academic achievement, the monograph is also a very powerful political statement. It is one of the most impressive, in-depth arguments for the relevance of the study of Central Europe as a historical region... The book should certainly be received favourable by Anglophone students of Central and Eastern Europe, who would find this text a must-read in decades to come. In the English-speaking academic world, it is most likely to be used as an essential reference work that provides a broad - and yet in-depth - overview of the region's cultural, linguistic and historical landscape.' - Bal\u00e1zs Apor, AB Imperio 'This is a fine and invaluable study. We must be grateful to Kamusella for his meticulous scholarship and to Palgrave Macmillan for publishing a book with more pages than I have been allowed words to review it.' - Bernard Spolsky, Language Policy\n2013, Za kr\u00e1sn\u011bj\u0161\u00ed sv\u011bt: Tradicionalismus v architektu\u0159e 20. a 21. stolet\u00ed / Toward a More Beautiful World: Traditionalism in Architecture of the 20th and 21st Centuries\nTOWARD A MORE BEAUTIFUL WORLD (Brno: Barrister & Principal \u2013 VUTIUM 2013, 448 pp., 760 ill., an extensive English summary) uses innovative methodology to look at the traditionalist attitude in architecture and in the formation of architectural environment. In the five parts, the book (I) analyzes the professional debate around the history of architecture and the diversity of aesthetic preferences within this debate, (II) clarifies a theory that uses results of neuroscience to explain the attractiveness of traditional buildings, (III) based on this theory, sums up the history of twentieth- and twenty-first-century traditionalist architecture around the world and (IV) in the Czech Lands (the present Czech Republic), and (V) uses two specific examples to illustrate current variations in the relationship between heritage protection, musealization of art and the creation of an aesthetically valuable environment. The scope of the publication and its comprehensiveness make this book the first of its kind in the field of architectural history. The text is in Czech, nevertheless, international readers find all captions in English and an extensive English summary. The methodology of this book builds upon the architectural theory of the American scientist Nikos Salingaros, the impulses of world art studies, and the idea that there is a direct relationship between personal preference for a specific artistic morphology and the manner of its (art-historical) interpretation. The findings of brain science help specify the meaning of the words beauty and traditionalism. Even an untrained viewer can feel the contrast between traditional and modern architecture, while neighboring buildings in two different traditional styles (for example a baroque palace and a Gothic church) do not create the same impression of contrast or disharmony. The book explains the difference in aesthetic effect through Salingaros\u2019s term structural order. This concept understands traditional architecture as an architecture designed according to the principles of structural order and modernist architecture as an architecture, where structural order is weak or non-existent. The concept put forward in this book is that architectural traditionalism strives to express structural order, while architectural modernism, which exists simultaneously, does not aim for this kind of order, neither consciously nor intuitively. Art-historical conceptions are also referred to as either traditionalist or modernist, according to which approach to artistic creation they prefer. The struggle toward a more beautiful world is considered a leitmotif of traditionalism \u2013 hence the title of the book. The book\u2019s five parts and fifty chapters address themes such as: the aesthetic theory of empathy as elaborated by Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin and Geoffrey Scott; the scientific theory of architecture according to Christopher Alexander and Nikos Salingaros; American renaissance and the City Beautiful movement; city building according to artistic principles in the work of Camillo Sitte, Werner Hegemann and Gustavo Giovannoni; the Heimatschutz movement and Paul Schultze-Naumburg; the destruction and reconstruction of old cities and the Venice Charter; the New Tradition, New Urbanism and the vision of harmonious building according to Prince Charles. The chapters on the Czech Lands describe architectural works by Friedrich Ohmann, Jan Vejrych, Kamil Hilbert, Ladislav Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek and Du\u0161an Jurkovi\u010d and analyze texts by V\u00e1clav Wagner, B\u0159etislav \u0160torm, Josef Karel \u0158\u00edha, Ladislav \u017d\u00e1k and Ji\u0159\u00ed Kroha. These chapters also discuss cubism and socialist realism in Czech architecture, new development and heritage conservation during the communist era and after the regime change in 1989, and public interest in the fate of old buildings and in the appearance of towns, villages and landscapes.\n2013. Ed. by Adam G\u0142az, Marnie L. Moist and Elena Tribushinina. The book is concerned with Vantage Theory, a model of categorization proposed by the American linguist, anthropologist, and cognitive scientist, Robert E. MacLaury (1944-2004). It consists of three of his previously unpublished studies and five chapters by other authors. Vantage Theory (VT) views categorization as a process of vantage (point of view) construction by analogy to the way humans orient themselves in space-time. Originating in the domain of color, the theory was extended to cover other aspects of cognition and language. The chapters authored by MacLaury introduce the model, discuss the details of the analogy between space-time and categorization, and present four cases studies. The remaining chapters present an overview of the existing literature on VT, locate the model against the broader background of psychological and cognitive research, and propose its application to novel data. Adam G\u0142az, Assistant Professor at Marie Curie-Sk\u0142odowska University, Lublin, Poland, is interested in linguistic categorization and point of view in language and linguistics. Marnie L. Moist, Associate Professor of Psychology at Saint Francis University, USA, researches in teaching pedagogy, culture and categorization, and service-learning assessment. Elena Tribushinina, Assistant Professor at Utrecht Institute of Linguistics, the Netherlands, deals with cross-linguistic aspects of language acquisition and cognitive semantics. \u201cMastering and applying Vantage Theory takes careful reading and thought. It employs a notation system which has been designed to capture the relationships among the object of categorization and the mental vantages which define it. But the study is well worth it, and scholars in many areas will benefit from taking the time to understand the nuances of both the underlying premises of Vantage Theory and its notation. The papers in this volume help both the novice and those already acquainted with MacLaury's work with grasping the theory and finding their own areas of application. The broad range of topics makes it clear that it is a theory which can be applied in many arenas, at the least: anthropological, linguistic, literary, and cultural. As such, it should serve as an inspiration for the further exploration of mental vantages and their role in better understanding cognitive function and, in particular, categorization.\u201d - Margaret E.

Lutz Doering\u2019s new monograph seeks to redress this situation. The author pursues two major tasks: first, to provide a comprehensive discussion of Jewish letter writing in the Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman periods and, second, to assess the importance of ancient Jewish letter writing for the emergence and early development of Christian epistolography. Although individual groups of Jewish letters have been studied before, the present monograph is the first one to look at Jewish letters comprehensively across the languages in which they were written and/or handed down (chiefly Aramaic, Hebrew, and Greek). It operates with a broad concept of \"letter\u201d and deals with documentary as well as literary and embedded letters. The author highlights cross-linguistic developments, such as the influence of the Greek epistolary form on Aramaic and Hebrew letters or the non-idiomatic retention of Semitic \"peace\u201d greetings in some letters translated into Greek, which allowed for these greetings to be charged with new meaning. Doering argues that such processes were also important for early Christian epistolography. Thus, Paul engaged creatively with Jewish epistolary formulae. Frequent address of communities rather than individuals and the quasi-official setting of many Jewish letters would have provided relevant models when Paul developed his own epistolary praxis. In addition, the author shows that the concept of communication with the \"Diaspora\u201d, in both halakhic-administrative and prophetic-apocalyptic Jewish letters, is adapted by a number of early Christian letters, such as 1 Peter, James, Acts 15:23-29, and 1 Clement . Ancient Jewish and early Christian letters also share a concern with group identity and cohesion that is often supported by salvation-historical motifs. In sum, Lutz Doering addresses the previously under-researched text-pragmatic similarities between Jewish and Christian letters.\n2003\nContent of the thesis: The voluminous work, still available, consists of four parts. Part one is about the historiography during the \u201dreformations\u201c in the Holy Roman Empire. The focus of the historical work, especially of the still disputed medieval times, lies upon Belgium, Bavaria and Cologne. The second part follows the trail of humanistic historiography, in particular within the numerous local histories. Almost all Catholic regions in Central Europe published those antiquarian dominated works. A considerable part three reveals, how extensively and steadily court historiography developed at Habsburg Courts in particular, but as well in Bavaria. Finally, an analytic part four describes the particular problems of the generating and circulation of the historic knowledge for Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire: The Catholic res publica litteraria partially split itself among the boundaries of the orders of the Catholic Church where bitter feuds arose. Catholics often failed because of problems of loyalty: on the one side to the pope and on the other side to the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. This double loyalty made cooperation worse and strengthens the position of the Protestants, because those were able to perform as nonpartisan judges. Whereas the Protestants benefited from their command over most places of print and over modern publishing media like journals, Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire never succeeded in combining scientific and historiographic activities; sectional conflicts based on historical arguments had been too severe. Nevertheless, the writing of history by Catholics and in Catholic territories was very extensive up to the 18th century, as an attached list of publishing authors proof.\nThe book is divided into two main parts, preceded by an introduction which foregrounds the historiographical treatment of Vasari\u2019s frescos and his Ragionamenti in order to exemplify how 20th-century methodological theories and concepts concerning the question of allegory and hermeneutics are related to the analyses of Cinquecento written sources. Part One is dedicated to the creation, use and immediate reception of the new apartments in the Palazzo Vecchio. By drawing on a rich number of published and unpublished visual and written sources, I reconstruct and analyze the political context, the structures and pragmatic working steps of Vasari\u2019s workshop, the role of figures such as the so-called \"iconographical advisor\", the intended public and the immediate reception of the rooms. By doing so, I show how the planning was determined not by an initial invention of the \"program\", but by consecutive decisions, the preference of pictorial over conceptual solutions, improvisations, and sometimes even misunderstandings. While considering aspects such as the \"private\" and the \"public\" in settings such as the ducal Palazzo Vecchio, I argue that the frescos and ceiling paintings favor spontaneous discoveries and that they evoke interpretations based on visual analogies rather than forcing the beholder to recall historical and mythographic knowledge available only to learned men. However, this mode of \"light\" reading does not necessarily prevent the mediation of pro-medicean messages in the new rooms of the Palazzo Vecchio. This is, as I demonstrate, partly due to the artistic re-use of inventions and designs: pragmatic ways to quickly produce decorations on a monumental scale, but which at the same time create a recognizable visual repertoire and symbolic pattern to represent and glorify a patron. Part Two begins by reconsidering and revising the genesis, dating and authorship of the Ragionamenti, a text that is partially preserved in a manuscript and that was published only posthumously in 1588, fourteen years after Vasari\u2019s death. The following chapters systematically investigate how descriptions of artworks, similar to those in the Ragionamenti, became increasingly more frequent over the course of the second half of the Cinquecento and the early 17th century, and I analyze and differentiate the literary genres, traditions and rhetorical modes of these image-related texts in the early modern period. I argue that the way in which explanations for paintings and painted allegories are suggested in such texts recall verbal practices of the artistic discourse, and by doing so, they bear witness to either the application of hermeneutical methods for the interpretation of images, or to poetic contemplations \u2013 the latter being linked rather to aesthetic appreciation and ekphrastic traditions than to ancient and medieval concepts of allegorical readings. That an increasing number of descriptions of artworks were published in the decades leading up to the Baroque has two possible explanations, both of which have origins in ancient rhetorical writings: First, the understanding that learned, political, or other meanings of artworks can not only be transmitted, but above all be determined through texts. Second, that the fame of artworks and artists depends on written texts (an idea that Vasari, who started to draft his Ragionamenti in which he glorifies his own paintings several years before he wrote his autobiography, knew best). After all, as the final chapter and the conclusion of the book summarize, the Cinquecento established a vivid written discourse on the arts that even engendered the writing of paratexts to paratexts: descriptions of artworks that required responses, to which other publications \u2013 but also paintings \u2013 answered yet again. Such texts therefore did not simply promote artworks, but helped to create a new way to reflect upon images\u2019 meanings, and encouraged an artistic discourse \u2013 and by doing so, they shaped the way in which art and iconography has been perceived from the Cinquecento onwards.\nWinner \u2013 2021 Manfred Lautenschlaeger Award for Theological Promise.

The author departs from the classical theory that Leviticus 17\u201326 merely presume, with minor modifications, a concept of centralization articulated in Deuteronomy. She shows how Leviticus 17\u201326 use ritual legislation to make a new, and distinctive case as to why the Israelites must defer to a central sanctuary, standardized ritual processes, and a hegemonic priesthood. This discourse of centralization reflects the historical challenges that faced priests in Jerusalem during the Persian era: in particular, the need to compensate for the loss of a royal sponsor, to pool communal resources in order to meet socio-economic pressures, and to find new means of negotiating with the sanctuary at Mount Gerizim and with a growing diaspora.
