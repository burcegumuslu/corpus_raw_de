As scholar, curator, teacher, and excavator, he has made significant contributions to nearly every aspect of Egyptology and already claims a major legacy of students taught directly or indirectly through his nearly twenty books and over 130 articles. Hardly a member of the lay public interested in Egypt has not read and enjoyed his Literature of Ancient Egypt, An Anthology of Stories, Instructions, and Poetry (edited and translated with R.O. Faulkner and E.F. Wente) or learned from his Ancient Near East: A History (co-authored with W.W. Hallo). To know Kelly, as friends and acquaintances all address him, is to know a man profoundly interested in and knowledgeable about a wide variety of topics. He is a leading collector of modern and contemporary art, and has generously lent to many shows in those areas. He has served as trustee of institutions as diverse as the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts, the French Institute\u2013Alliance Fran\u00e7aise New York, and the Museum of Primitive Art. The International Association of Egyptologists, the American Research Center in Egypt, the American University in Cairo, and the American School of Classical Studies in Athens have all acknowledged his leadership abilities by electing him president, vicepresident, or chairman. Born in New York City on January 3, 1928, Kelly Simpson graduated from the Buckley School (New York) and Phillips Academy (Andover, Massachusetts) before attending Yale University. At Yale, he received his B.A. and M.A. in English. In search of a job afterwards, he was hired by W.C. Hayes and Ambrose Lansing in the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s Egyptian Department, where he served as Curatorial Assistant from 1948 to 1954. Within a year of accepting the job, he published his first Egyptological articles, on a Fourth Dynasty head and the Tell Basta treasure, the first two in a long list covering a tremendous breadth of material in the field. Taking classes at the Metropolitan while he worked there, Kelly pursued a Ph.D. in Egyptology under the tutelage of Ludlow Bull and wrote his dissertation on the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s excavation of the pyramid of Amenemhat I at Lisht. It was also during his years at the Metropolitan Museum that he participated in his first archaeolog-\n002 WKS Freed/Preface.5 Page xii Wednesday, November 13, 1996 10:00 AM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nical excavation (in Nimrud, Iraq, under the auspices of the British School of Archaeology) and served in the New York National Guard, retiring as First Lieutenant. Upon completion of his Ph.D. in 1954, Simpson received the prestigious Fulbright Fellowship and visited Egypt for the first time. In addition to touring museums and archaeological sites, he also excavated at the Bent Pyramid at Dahshur under the directorship of Ahmed Fakhry and at Mitrahineh with the University of Pennsylvania, where he worked with Rudolph Anthes. After two years in Egypt, he returned to the U.S. to Harvard University, accepting a position as Research Fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies. Recognizing a young scholar with stellar potential, Yale University offered William Kelly Simpson an assistant professorship in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Literatures in 1958. He was promoted to Associate Professor of Egyptology in 1963 and made full professor two years later, a position he still holds. It was thanks to Kelly Simpson that Yale University became involved in archaeological fieldwork in Egypt in 1960. Responding to the international call for help in rescuing the monuments of Nubia at the time of the building of the Aswan High Dam, Simpson led a joint team from the University of Pennsylvania and Yale to Toshka and Arminna for three seasons, excavating and recording New Kingdom Egyptianizing tombs and Late Meroitic cemeteries, which he published in 1963. The Pennsylvania\u2013Yale team then moved north to work on the Middle Kingdom remains at Abydos under the co-directorship of Simpson and his student, David O\u2019Connor, now Lila Acheson Wallace Professor of Ancient Egyptian Art at the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University. Simpson\u2019s 1974 volume that was inspired by this work, The Terrace of the Great God at Abydos, forms a basis for any scholarship done on stelae, administration, or social organization of the Middle Kingdom. It was also during his years at Yale that he completed three out of four landmark volumes on the Middle Kingdom hieratic texts from Naga ed-Deir known as Papyrus Reisner. To quote one of its many glowing reviews: The. . . volumes. . . are monuments of careful and painstaking scholarship which yield almost an embarrassment of material to broaden our paleographical and lexicographical knowledge of Middle Egyptian, as well as furnishing material for the administrative study of the Middle Kingdom. . . .1\n1 A.R.\nxii\nSchulman, JARCE 6 (1967), p. 175.\n002 WKS Freed/Preface.5 Page xiii Wednesday, November 13, 1996 10:00 AM\nPreface\nIn 1970, a year after completing a three-year tenure as Chairman of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Literatures at Yale, Kelly Simpson was offered the Curatorship of the Department of Egyptian and Ancient Near Eastern Art (now called the Department of Ancient Egyptian, Nubian, and Near Eastern Art) at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which he accepted in addition to his Yale professorship. For the next seventeen years, he split his time weekly between Boston and New Haven, and devoted full-time attention to each job. With the collection as his primary focus, he refurbished galleries and added fully 500 objects to the collection. Hiring students interested in Egyptology every summer, he saw to it that a younger generation was given the opportunity to work in the Department, its present curator and most of its present staff included. Recognizing the need to publish the tremendous legacy of Giza mastabas excavated by George A. Reisner, Simpson reopened the Museum of Fine Arts\u2019 excavations at Giza in 1970, after a nearly thirty-year hiatus, in order to complete the recording of the tombs and finalize their publication. He remains its principal project director. Also in 1970, the inaugural volume of the Giza Mastabas series, The Mastaba of Queen Mersyankh III, was published under the joint authorship of Simpson and Dows Dunham. As of 1996, a total of six volumes have been published in the series (four by Simpson) and an additional six are in preparation. In 1986 Kelly Simpson resigned the curatorship in Boston to devote his full attention to teaching and writing, which he does to this day. Upon his departure, the administration of the Museum of Fine Arts appointed him Consultative Curator in gratitude and recognition of his accomplishments at the museum and in the expectation and hope that he would continue to serve in an advisory capacity. To date, he is the only person in the museum\u2019s history to hold this title and distinction. These sixty-eight articles written by scholars from nine countries are offered in gratitude and tribute to a great man. The substantial task of administering, editing, and designing these volumes was admirably borne by Peter Der Manuelian, another scholar whose entry into the field of Egyptology was made possible by William Kelly Simpson. From the entire staff of the Department of Ancient Egyptian, Nubian, and Near Eastern Art, a resounding \u2122n\u221e, w\u2202\u00a3, snb (life, prosperity, health) to Kelly, with affection. Rita E.

Having participated in one of the University\u2019s excavations in Greece, I began attending the annual meetings of the Archaeological Institute of America. It was at one of these meetings that I first met Kelly Simpson. I was immediately impressed by the fact that he was both professor of Egyptology at Yale and Curator of Egyptian Art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In the fall of my senior year, as I pondered whether to pursue graduate studies or to gravitate towards law or business school, out of the blue I received a telephone call that was to change my life. Kelly Simpson was on the line, informing me that he had an assistant\u2019s opening in the Egyptian Department at the Museum and asking if I would be interested in discussing it with him. Needless to say, I was on the next plane, and thus began my lifelong love both of Egyptology and of the Museum of Fine Arts. I was, however, curious as to why he would consider me for the position rather than one of his graduate students or someone else far more qualified than I. In his characteristically candid way, he replied that this was a curatorial position and that, in his opinion, it would be more productive for the Museum to take on someone who had an interest in ancient art and archaeology and train him in Egyptian art than to bring in one of his graduate students\u2014all of whom at the time were philologists\u2014and try to get them to look at an object as a work of art. Ever since that first telephone call, Kelly has had a profound influence on my life as teacher, mentor, and friend. He was (and is) a demanding professor with a razor-sharp mind and quick wit, but at the same time he gives freely of his advice and wisdom. His interests extend far beyond his chosen field, both in art and in his love of the opera. Given the enormous impact he has had on students, colleagues, and friends alike, it is only fitting that so many of the leading scholars in the field have contributed to this book. Enjoy!

Allen\nO\nver the course of his Egyptological career, the name of William Kelly Simpson has become nearly synonymous with Middle Kingdom studies. Although his interests have included most aspects of ancient Egyptian civilization, Kelly\u2019s first love has always been the literature, art, and history of the Middle Kingdom. The list of his publications bears eloquent witness to just how much his scholarship has expanded and enriched our knowledge in these areas over the past forty years. It is my privilege to offer the present study\u2014 which covers an equivalent span of time in the formation of the Middle Kingdom\u2014in tribute to Kelly\u2019s scholarship, and with affection to an esteemed colleague and a treasured friend. The recent redating of the tomb of Meket-re (TT 280, fig. 1) to the early years of Amenemhat I has provided a new benchmark for the art 1 and history of the early Middle Kingdom. Given the service of Meketre under Mentuhotep II (see below), this new dating now provides evidence for an official career stretching from the last decades of Mentuhotep II (ca. 2030\u20132010 B.C. in the traditional chronology), through the reign of Mentuhotep III (ca. 2010\u20131998 B.C.) and the end of the Eleventh Dynasty, to the first years of Dynasty 12 (ca. 1991\u20131981 B.C.). The titles preserved in Meket-re\u2019s tomb are mr \u221etmt \u201cOverseer of the Seal\u201d and mr pr wr \u201cChief Steward.\u201d2 The former identifies him as\n1\nDorothea Arnold, \u201cAmenemhat I and the Early Twelfth Dynasty at Thebes,\u201d MMJ 26 (1991), pp. 21\u201332; J. Allen, \u201cThe Coffin Fragments of Meketra,\u201d MMJ 26 (1991), pp. 39\u201340. I am grateful to Dorothea Arnold for discussing the subject of the present paper with me and for offering numerous valuable comments. In Arnold, op. cit., p. 23 and p. 38 fig. 62, and Allen, op. cit., p. 39, the bookroll with two ties, which appears on a fragment from Meket-re\u2019s coffin, was cited as partial evidence for the date of the tomb.

The title of mr pr wr, which appears only in his tomb, was presumably conferred on him by Amenemhat I. Meket-re\u2019s predecessor as mr \u221etmt was probably Khety, the owner of TT 311 (MMA tomb no. 508), above Mentuhotep\u2019s temple in the north cliff of Deir el-Bahari (fig. 2). Khety appears with this title in two graffiti from the Wadi Shatt el-Rigala, where he is shown before the figure of Mentuhotep II.6 In a nearby group of graffiti commemorating other officials of Mentuhotep\u2019s court, Meket-re is identified only as mrr nb\u2260f 7 m\u00a3 mikwt-r\u2122 \u201cTruly beloved of his lord, Meket-re.\u201d These may date to Mentuhotep II\u2019s Year 39, but are probably a few years later (see below).\n3\nW.

He may also appear in the reliefs of Mentuhotep\u2019s mortuary temple, like Meket-re, although the evidence is not unequivocal.22 If so, he must have died while the temple was being decorated, since there is no evidence for more than one royal mr \u221etmt in office at any one time.

Allen, Some Theban Officials of the Early Middle Kingdom\nbecame mr \u221etmt sometime before the final decade of Mentuhotep II and was succeeded by Meket-re in the king\u2019s last years, before the decoration of the mortuary temple had been completed. In this respect, several monuments attributed to the Khety of TT 311 (hereafter distinguished, for convenience, as \u201cKhety I\u201d) should probably be assigned to other individuals. Winlock identified Khety I with the expedition-leader named in the Aswan graffito of Year 41, cited above.23 The identification is tempting, but the title mr \u221etmww makes 24 such an equation problematic, since it is apparently a variant of the more common title mr \u221etmt\u00a1w, of lower rank than mr \u221etmt.25 If the two men were identical, Khety could have become mr \u221etmt in Year 41 at the earliest. This in turn would date the burial of Mentuhotep\u2019s queens, and building phase C of his mortuary temple, also to Year 41 at the earliest. Though barely conceivable, the time span is probably too short to accommodate the architectural and historical events that occurred before the king\u2019s death in Year 51: building phases C and D of the royal mortuary temple,26 Khety\u2019s career and the construction of his own tomb, and Khety\u2019s death and the succession of Meket-re. At any rate, the likeliest interpretation of the Wadi Shatt el-Rigala graffiti indicates that Khety I was already mr \u221etmt at the time of Mentuhotep II\u2019s Sed-Festival, in Year 39 at the latest. At the other end of the scale, Khety I has also been identified with the owner of a statue from Karnak and a second offering-table that may come from the same place.27 The statue was inscribed for the \u221etmt(\u00a1)b\u00a1t\u00a1 smr w\u2122(t\u00a1) (\u00a1)t-n\u2020r mr \u221etmt m t\u00a3 r \u2202r\u2260f \u00a1m\u00a3\u221e \ufb02ty m\u00a3\u2122 \u221erw \u201cKing\u2019s 22\nFrs. 82 (...] \u221etmt \ufb02[t]y[...), 660 (... \u221etm]t \ufb02ty), 3078 (...] \u221etmt \ufb02ty).

Although the first title is attested for the mr \u221etmt Khety (see above), the fact that it is followed by a separate mr \u221etmt suggests that the individual in question is another Khety, or Khety followed by his predecessor.

They must then be posthumous donations to Khety\u2019s cult, or objects made for a later individual of the same name and titles, who evidently served under Amenemhat I and perhaps into the next reign, as a successor of Meket-re, probably following the service of the mr \u221etmt Intef, who was buried in Meket-re\u2019s complex and who may have succeeded him in office.36 In his rise from \u221etmt(\u00a1) in Mentuhotep II\u2019s Year 41 to mr \u221etmt before the king\u2019s death, Meket-re seems to have bypassed the intermediate 37 rank of mr \u221etmt\u00a1w \u201cOverseer of Sealbearers.\u201d In Year 41, this office was apparently held by the expedition-leader Khety (if the two titles mr \u221etmww and mr \u221etmt\u00a1w are the same), under whom Meket-re visited Aswan. In the Wadi Shatt el-Rigala graffiti of Mentuhotep II\u2019s courtiers, it is associated with a man named Meru, who appears in at least two inscriptions: as \u221etmt\u00a1-b\u00a1t(\u00a1) smr w\u2122t(\u00a1) mr \u221e\u00a3swt \u00a1\u00a3btt \u00a1w n\u2260f wrw m ksw r r(w)t pr-(n)swt mry-nb\u2260f mr \u221etmt\u00a1w mrw \u201cKing\u2019s Sealbearer, Unique Friend, Overseer of the Eastern Hill-country, to whom the great come bowing at the gate of the King\u2019s House, his lord\u2019s chosen, Overseer of Sealbearers Meru;\u201d38 and as simply mr \u221etmt\u00a1w mrw \u201cOverseer of Sealbearers Meru.\u201d39 Since there is no clear evidence for two royal mr \u221etmt\u00a1w serving at the same time, a third graffito in the same group should perhaps be assigned to the same individual: it names the m\u00a2-\u00a1b35 Winlock, BMMA 18 (1923), Part 2, pp. 14 fig. 4 and 17 fig. 7.

There is no direct evidence associating Meket-re with the office of mr \u221etmt\u00a1w. A fragment from his tomb has the partial inscription \u221etmt\u00a1w n (MMA 20.3.1002), but the context and reference are unknown. Winlock\u2019s reading of a Wadi Shatt el-Rigala graffito as mr \u221etmt\u00a1w mikwt (AJSL 57 (1940), p. 155 = Rise and Fall, p. 71) is questionable: see the copy in Petrie, Season, pl. 14 no. 409. It is not associated with those of Mentuhotep II\u2019s courtiers, and is evidently of a different individual; Meket-re\u2019s name is not otherwise attested without the r\u2122 element. A [...] \u221etmt mikt\u00a1 appears in the mortuary temple reliefs (fr. 5332; see n. 22), perhaps identical with the [\ufb02r\u00a1] \u2122 mr \u221etmt m[...], who also occurs in the mortuary temple (fr. 345), and with the \u221etmw mikwt attested in the Wadi Shatt el-Rigala (Winlock, AJSL 57 (1940), p. 155). 38 Petrie, Season, pl. 15 no. 459; Winlock, AJSL 57 (1940), pp. 148 fig. 10G, 150\u201351 = Rise and Fall, p. 68 and pl. 39G. 39 Petrie, Season, pl. 15 no. 478; Winlock, AJSL 57 (1940), p. 151 and n. 50 = Rise and Fall, p. 68 and n. 40.\n9\n01 ALLEN Page 10 Friday, July 23, 2004 9:54 AM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\n(n)sw m st\u2260f nb \u00a2z.n nb\u2260f m\u00a3\u2122 \u221etmt\u00a1-b\u00a1t(\u00a1) mr \u221etmt\u00a1w mry \u201cKing\u2019s trustee in all his places, whom his lord has truly favored, King\u2019s Sealbearer, Overseer of Sealbearers Mery.\u201d40 If there was in fact only a single mr \u221etmt\u00a1w in office at any one time, and if the title of the expedition-leader Khety in the Aswan graffito was in fact equivalent to mr \u221etmt\u00a1w, Meru\u2019s appearance with the same title in the Wadi Shatt el-Rigala graffiti dates these inscriptions to Year 41 or later. The two dates of \u201cYear 39\u201d scratched next to the graffiti depicting Mentuhotep II must then refer to the year of the event commemorated (the king\u2019s Sed-Festival?) and not to that of the inscriptions themselves\u2014if, in fact, they have any contemporary relevance at all. At any rate, Meru is firmly attested as mr \u221etmt\u00a1w in Year 46 of Mentuhotep II by a stela of his, which was probably erected in Abydos.41 The same title appears in the sarcophagus from his tomb (TT 240, MMA tomb no. 517), the easternmost in the row of early Middle Kingdom tombs in the north cliff of Deir el-Bahari (fig. 2).42 The date of Meru\u2019s death is unknown, but could be as late as the beginning of Dyn. 12 on the basis of his tomb\u2019s 43 architecture and the orthography of his sarcophagus. In that case, he will have been roughly the same age as Meket-re, under whom he apparently served for most of his professional career. As noted above, Meket-re\u2019s title of mr pr wr \u201cChief Steward\u201d was evidently conferred on him late in life by Amenemhat I, since it is not attested before the Twelfth Dynasty.

The graffito of a mr \u221etmt\u00a1w sbkw-\u00a2tp is not associated with those of Mentuhotep\u2019s court, and is probably later: Petrie, Season, pl. 17 no. 586; Winlock, AJSL 57 (1940), p. 153 and fig. 12 = Rise and Fall, p. 69 and pl. 38D. Meru\u2019s name is not otherwise attested in the spelling mry, but the variant mrw\u2260(\u00a1) ~ mr\u00a1\u2260\u00a1 is plausible: cf. Schenkel, Fm\u00e4S, \u00a7 18. An Aswan graffito of Year 41 that Winlock assigns to Meru (Petrie, Season, pl. 8 no. 243: AJSL 57 (1940), p. 152) belonged to a man named mrr-tty: cf. Schenkel, MHT, no. 358. Winlock apparently changed his mind about the attribution, since it is not repeated in Rise and Fall, p. 69. 41 Turin 1447: Schenkel, MHT, no. 387. A good photograph can be found in L.

Allen, Some Theban Officials of the Early Middle Kingdom\nto have been the Steward (mr pr) Henenu, a contemporary of Khety I. The tomb of Henenu (TT 313, MMA tomb no. 510) is similar in design to that of Khety, and lies to its east (fig. 2). His name (mr pr \u00a2nnw) occurs on linen from the tomb of Mentuhotep II\u2019s queen Miyet, in the king\u2019s mortuary complex, like that of Khety in the burials of Aashyt and Henhenet.44 Henenu\u2019s tomb, like Khety\u2019s, commemorated the titulary associated with the final phase of Mentuhotep\u2019s reign, both on its entrance doorway and in at least one of the two wall-stelae flanking the entrance.45 Besides his chief office, the fragments from Henenu\u2019s tomb record a number of his other titles, honorary and functional:46 \u221etmt(\u00a1)47 b\u00a1t\u00a1 smr w\u2122[t(\u00a1)] \u201cKing\u2019s Sealbearer, Unique Friend,\u201d \ufb02r\u00a1-tp\u00a1-[(n)sw] \u201cKing\u2019s Confidant,\u201d48 mr [\u2122b] w\u00a2mw \u00dfw n\u00dfmt \u201cOverseer of horn, hoof, feather, and scale,\u201d49 mr qb\u00a2 p\u00a3wt \u221enn[t] \u201cOverseer of fowl that swim, fly, and land,\u201d50 and mr nt[t] \u00a1w[tt] \u201cOverseer of what is and is not.\u201d The title mr pr occurs throughout Henenu\u2019s tomb, as well as on fragments from his sarcophagus.51 On Stela A it has the unique form [m]r pr \u2122\u00a3, perhaps also m[r pr \u2122\u00a3] m t\u00a3 r \u2202r\u2260f.52 Unlike the Twelfth Dynasty\u2019s mr pr wr, the adjective here probably does not qualify the title mr pr (\u201cGreat Steward\u201d) but is to be read with pr alone\u2014i.e., \u201cOverseer of the pr \u2122\u00a3.\u201d53 Hence, perhaps, the additional qualification m t\u00a3 r \u2202r\u2260f \u201cin the entire land.\u201d Given the scope of Henenu\u2019s stewardship, this is evidently a forerunner of the later title mr pr wr \u201cChief Steward,\u201d which Amenemhat I bestowed on his successor, Meket-re. The linen mark from Miyet\u2019s tomb indicates that Henenu, like Khety, came into office before the final phase of Mentuhotep II\u2019s reign. 44 MMA\n22.3.7, unpublished: MMA Theban Expedition Tomb Card 65, photograph MCC 133. 45 The doorway is unpublished: MMA Theban Expedition Journal 3, p. 142, photograph M7C 133.

Their common responsibility for property may account for the fact that both bear the title mr \u2122b w\u00a2mw n\u00dfmt \u00dfw \u201cOverseer of horn, hoof, scale, and feather\u201d apparently at the same time: in Khety\u2019s case, the title may denote the king\u2019s private livestock; in Henenu\u2019s, that of the state. The titulary of Mentuhotep II in Henenu\u2019s tomb shows that he survived with Khety into the king\u2019s final decade. Like Khety, he may have 55 been represented in the reliefs of Mentuhotep\u2019s mortuary temple. In construction and decoration (discussed below), Henenu\u2019s tomb is somewhat earlier than that of Khety. For this reason, Henenu is porbably not identical with the Steward Henu who led an expedition to the Wadi Hammamat in Year 8 of Mentuhotep III.56 Since no other stewards of comparable rank are known from the late Eleventh Dynasty,57 Henu seems to have been Henenu\u2019s successor as (Chief) Steward and Meketre\u2019s predecessor. His tomb is not known, but it could be one of the anonymous structures in the north cliff\u2014perhaps MMA 511, just west of Henenu\u2019s. Apart from Meket-re, Khety, and perhaps also Henenu, two other high officials are known to have been honored by the inclusion of their names and figures in the reliefs of Mentuhotep II\u2019s mortuary temple. The first of these, the vizier Bebi, occurs only once, as the last of a row of officials; the accompanying inscription (the only one preserved) reads: \u2020\u00a3(t\u00a1) z\u00a3b t\u00a3\u00a1t\u00a1 bb\u00a1 \u201cVizier, Dignitary of the Curtain, Bebi.\u201d58 The second, the vizier Dagi, is attested on several fragments, one of which names him as \u00a2\u00a3t(\u00a1) \u2122 mr nwt \u2020\u00a3(t\u00a1) z\u00a3b t\u00a3\u00a1t\u00a1 d\u00a3g[\u00a1] \u201cHigh Official, Overseer of the Pyramid Town, Vizier, Dignitary of the Curtain, Dagi.\u201d59 Since there is no evidence for two viziers in office at the same time during this period, 54 Petrie, Season, pl. 15 no. 487; Winlock, AJSL 57 (1940), pp. 149 and 148 fig. 10C = Rise and Fall, p. 67 and pl. 39C. 55 A [...] \u221enr[t] \u00a2nnw appears on one fragment (646), but a title with this element is not otherwise attested for the Steward Henenu. 56 Couyat and Montet, Hamm\u00e2m\u00e2t, no. 114.

Allen, Some Theban Officials of the Early Middle Kingdom\none or the other must have died during the decoration of the temple\u2014 60 most probably Bebi, who is not known elsewhere. Dagi appears with other members of Mentuhotep\u2019s court in the graffiti of the Wadi Shatt el-Rigala, as mr \u00a2wt 6 wrt d\u00a3g ms.n nmt(\u00a1) \u201cOverseer of the Great Enclosure of Six, Dagi, born of Nemti.\u201d61 This inscription commemorates Dagi\u2019s career at a stage where he had assumed at least partial responsibility for the office of vizier.62 Since Bebi\u2019s name does not appear in the graffiti, it is conceivable that he had died and that Dagi was in fact vizier in his own right. If so, Dagi\u2019s inscription dates the Wadi Shatt el-Rigala graffiti to a time when the decoration of Mentuhotep II\u2019s mortuary temple (phase D) had been started but not yet completed. Dagi is also attested as vizier in his tomb on the hill of Sheikh Abd el-Qurna, south of the causeway of Mentuhotep\u2019s mortuary temple (TT 103, fig. 1). The tomb was decorated in two stages, the second of which\u2014probably begun after Dagi\u2019s appointment as vizier\u2014involved 59 Fr. 471: Davies, Five Theban Tombs, p. 39; Cl\u00e8re and Vandier, TPPI, no. 28r5. The begin-\nning of the inscription is lost; the word nwt \u201ctown\u201d has a \u201cpyramid\u201d determinative. Dagi also appears in fr. 5352 ([...] z\u00a3b t\u00a3\u00a1t\u00a1 d\u00a3g) and probably also fr. 1097 ([...] t\u00a3 r \u2202r\u2260f d\u00a3g[\u00a1]). 60 Fr. 5352, cited in the preceding note, may join with another (fr. 1496), which would identify the official preceding Dagi as \u2020\u00a3(t\u00a1) z\u00a3b [t\u00a3\u00a1t\u00a1 ...]\u2014perhaps honoring Dagi\u2019s immediate predecessor, Bebi. Whether this indicates that the two viziers were in office simultaneously, however, is debatable. For the question, see E. Martin-Pardey, \u201cWesir, Wesirat,\u201d L\u00c4 6, cols. 1227\u201328, with additional references there. 61 Petrie, Season, pl. 15, 455+456; Winlock, AJSL 57 (1940), pp. 148 fig. 10D-E, 150 = Rise and Fall, pp. 57\u201368 and pl. 39D\u2013E. Winlock read the title as part of Meket-re\u2019s graffito, and the name as part of graffito E (Petrie 456). It is evident, however, from the facsimile (and photograph in H.E. Winlock, \u201cThe Egyptian Expedition, 1925\u20131927,\u201d BMMA 23 (1928) Section 2, p. 23 fig. 24) that Petrie\u2019s 455+456 = Winlock\u2019s D-E actually consists of three separate graffiti.

Ranke, Die \u00e4gyptischen Personennamen 1 (Gl\u00fcckstadt, 1935\u201377), p. 288, 27; the \u00a3-bird above and between the m\u00a3 and \u00a2 signs appears to belong to this inscription, inserted secondarily. Meket-re\u2019s graffito (the beginning of Winlock\u2019s D) was inscribed next, above that of Si-Mahes (E); its signs seem to have been adjusted around the superlinear \u00a3 of E. The two lines of Dagi\u2019s text were added last, to the left: the upper line is lower than Meket-re\u2019s, and the bottom line is higher than that of Si-Mahes. The spelling d\u00a3g also appears in the mortuary temple reliefs (fr. 5352: see note 59 above) and in Dagi\u2019s tomb (Davies, Five Theban Tombs, pl. 38, 1); the vizier Dagi is also depicted with a woman named nmt\u00a1 there (Davies, op. cit., p. 32 n. 8, p. 37, and pl. 34). 62 The title mr \u00a2wt 6 wrt is a common, and nearly exclusive, feature of the vizier\u2019s titulary: cf.

It could conceivably have been decorated for another Dagi, perhaps a son of the vizier, but there is no evidence for a burial other than Dagi\u2019s in the tomb.68 In this light, it is arguable that the sarcophagus was made for Dagi himself, just prior to his burial. The fact that it does not mention his highest title is disturbing, but not completely unparalleled: the sarcophagus of the 63 Davies, Five Theban Tombs, pp. 28\u201330; Dieter Arnold, Das Grab des Jnj-jtj.f, AV 4 (Mainz, 1971), p. 40; B.

Allen, Some Theban Officials of the Early Middle Kingdom\nvizier Mentuhotep, who served under Senwosret I, and the tomb chamber of Siese, vizier of Amenemhat II, also bear no evidence of their owners\u2019 service as vizier\u2014perhaps in deference to their successors\u2014 although at least the sarcophagus of Mentuhotep was made near the end of its owner\u2019s life.69 Though fraught with uncertainties, the bulk of evidence thus suggests that Dagi initially served as mr rwyt during the viziership of Bebi and was promoted to vizier after the latter\u2019s death sometime in the final decade of Mentuhotep II\u2019s reign. Among the titles preserved in his tomb are several comparable to those held by the Chief Steward Henu in Year 8 of Mentuhotep III: mr prw\u00a1-\u00a2\u2202 mr prw\u00a1 nbw mr \u00dfnwt\u00a1 \u201cOverseer of the Double Treasuries of Silver and Gold, Overseer of the Double Granary.\u201d70 If this is of any significance, it may serve to date Dagi\u2019s death to the same year, at the latest. At any rate, he cannot have survived beyond Year 2 of Mentuhotep IV, when Amenemhat is attested as vizier.71 Dagi\u2019s probable date of death, between Year 8 of Mentuhotep III, at the earliest, and Year 2 of Mentuhotep IV, at the latest, has further ramifications for the date of the vizier Ipi, the owner of TT 315 (MMA tomb no. 516). On the basis of his tomb\u2019s position, just west of Meru\u2019s in the row of tombs lining the north cliff of Deir el-Bahari, Ipi has generally been dated to the reign of Mentuhotep II. Unlike the other tomb-owners in this row, however, Ipi is not attested outside his tomb, and the tomb itself bears no evidence of an association with that king.72 The tomb\u2019s position alone makes it unlikely that Ipi preceded Bebi as vizier. This leaves only two periods within the late Eleventh Dynasty when Ipi could have been in office: a few years between Bebi and Dagi in the last decade of Mentuhotep II; or a maximum of six years between the death of Dagi and the accession of the vizier Amenemhat, assuming that the latter was appointed by Mentuhotep IV. The former is improbable, not only because the vizier Ipi does not appear in the reliefs of Mentuhotep\u2019s mortuary temple, unlike Bebi and Dagi,73 but also because the time involved would seem to be too short for the construction of his tomb. The latter 69\nSee Simpson, in Pyramid Studies, p. 60. Cf. Willems, Chests of Life, p. 112. The sarcophagus of Ipi, however, bears his vizieral titles (MMA Theban Expedition drawings AM 138 and 774): L.S. Bull, \u201cA New Vizier of the Eleventh Dynasty,\u201d JEA 10 (1924), p. 15.

More importantly, however, Ipi\u2019s tomb bears several features that point to a later date for its construction. Although most of the late Eleventh-Dynasty burials in the north cliff of Deir el-Bahari were accompanied by wood models, as was that of Meket-re, only the tombs of Ipi, Meru, and Meket-re contained separate chambers for such models, excavated in each case in the floor of the entrance corridor.74 This feature alone places Ipi\u2019s tomb in a group dating probably (Meru) or certainly (Meket-re) to the early Twelfth Dynasty. His tomb also has a number of other characteristics found otherwise only in the tomb of Meket-re. Both complexes contain a contemporary subsidiary tomb excavated in the upper righthand corner of the courtyard: that of Wah, Meket-re\u2019s storekeeper (mr st); and that of Meseh, in 75 the case of Ipi. In the same corner, each complex also exhibits a small crypt in which the owner\u2019s embalming materials were interred.76 This last peculiarity is linked to another significant characteristic of Ipi\u2019s burial: the presence of a canopic chest alongside the sarcophagus. Of all contemporary nonroyal Theban tombs, only that of Ipi and the coordinate burials of Meket-re and Intef exhibit this feature.77 The separate burial of the viscera in a canopic chest seems to be a northern practice, adopted in the south only after the reunification and for nonroyal burials in Thebes apparently only at the very end of the Eleventh Dynasty or 73 See Arnold, MMJ 26 (1991), p. 48 n. 195. An official identified only as [...]p\u00a1 appears among those honored in the reliefs of Mentuhotep II\u2019s mortuary temple (fr. 3346). 74 For\nplans of TT 315 (Ipi) and TT 280 (Meket-re), see Winlock, Excavations, pp. 54 fig. 6 and 18 fig. 2, respectively. The plan of TT 240 (Meru) is unpublished (MMA Theban Expedition drawing AM 4330). An antecedent exists in the burial of Mentuhotep II: Arnold, Tempel 1, pp. 45\u201346; 2, pp. 11\u201313. The feature is absent, however, from the tombs of Mentuhotep\u2019s queens, although that of Neferu (TT 319) has several small niches that could have been used to store models: Winlock, op. cit., p. 102 fig. 8. The use of a separate chamber thus appears to have been initially a feature of the royal burial, and adopted only much later for non-royal tombs. Arnold\u2019s impression that \u201cnearly all the large tombs in the northern cliff\u201d had model chambers (ibid., 1, p. 46 and n. 105) is mistaken. Of the \u201clarge tombs\u201d (nos. 508\u2013517), only that of Ipi (516 = TT 315), cited by Arnold, and Meru (517 = TT 240) have a distinct chamber like that of Meket-re. Nos. 508 (TT 311) 509, 512, 513 (TT 314), and 515 have none at all (MMA Theban Expedition drawings AM 759, 1285, 768, and 1287\u201388). No. 510 (TT 313, Henenu) has three, all apparently later excavations (MMA Theban Expedition drawings AM 766, 1295; Winlock, MMA Theban Expedition Journal 3, p. 146). No. 511 has a crude shaft with two chambers, sunk in the floor of its chapel (MMA Theban Expedition drawing 1283), probably associated with the six burials of early Twelfth-Dynasty coffins found in this tomb (MMA Theban Expedition Tomb Cards 1738\u201343). No. 514, a \u201cgallery\u201d tomb for multiple burials, has five subterranean chambers off its entrance corridor (MMA Theban Expedition drawing AM 1286). 75 Winlock, Excavations, pp. 29\u201330 and 55.

As with separate model chambers, the use of this feature appears first in the burial of Mentuhotep II (though perhaps only in jars, without a canopic chest) and only much later in the tombs of court officials. The distinctive architectural features that Ipi\u2019s tomb shares with that of Meket-re indicate that it was constructed, like the latter, at the beginning of Dyn. 12. If so, Ipi\u2019s service as vizier must be placed in the same period, presumably as the first vizier of Amenemhat I and successor of the vizier Amenemhat. Barring the discovery of another late Eleventh-Dynasty vizier, Dagi\u2019s tenure will then have stretched from the death of Bebi to the appointment of Amenemhat in the final years of Mentuhotep III or early in the reign of Mentuhotep IV. The careers of Dagi and the other officials discussed above, during the forty years from the last decades of Mentuhotep II to the first of Dyn. 12, are summarized in the table in fig. 3. This proposed chronology, and the attendant discussion above, involves of necessity some revision in the picture of the Theban necropolis and its development in the late Eleventh and early Twelfth Dynasties. The two ends of the process are anchored by the tombs of Khety (TT 311) and Meket-re (TT 280). Meket-re\u2019s appearance as mr \u221etmt in the mortuary temple reliefs of Mentuhotep II dates the death of Khety fairly securely to the last decade of Mentuhotep\u2019s reign, and Meket-re\u2019s own tomb has been dated to the early years of Amenemhat I, as noted above. 77\nFor Ipi, cf. Winlock, Excavations, p. 54 fig. 6; \u201cThe Egyptian Expedition, 1921\u20131922,\u201d BMMA 17 (1922), Part 2, p. 38 fig. 29. The chests of Meket-re and Intef are recorded in plan in MMA Theban Expedition drawing AM 645; Meket-re\u2019s was placed under the sarcophagus. All three are of stone. Winlock\u2019s published plan of Khety\u2019s tomb (Excavations, p. 69, fig. 7) shows a canopic chest beside the sarcophagus, but this is simply speculative. The original plan (MMA Theban Expedition drawing AM 723) records the box only as a reconstruction. No fragments of such a chest were actually found. The assumption that there was one is based on the general shape of the pit in which the sarcophagus was constructed. The photograph of this pit as found (M4C 113) shows only a crude excavation in one of its sides, with rough walls and an uneven floor, unsuited for the placement of a canopic chest. If it had any purpose at all, the feature is more probably a slot for the wood beams used to maneuver the large slabs of the sarcophagus. 78 Two\nwood heads, probably from canopic jars, were found in the tomb of Mentuhotep II: Arnold, Tempel 2, p. 49 and pl. 62a. The bodies of Mentuhotep\u2019s queens, however, were buried with viscera intact: Winlock, MMA Theban Expedition Tomb Card 22. Of the nonroyal examples collected by B.

It was decorated in two stages. The statue chamber at the end of its entrance corridor was originally plastered and painted, in a \u201clocal\u201d style analogous to\u2014but different from\u2014that found in the earlier tombs of Intef (TT 386) and Djar (TT 366).79 The walls of this chamber and those of the corridor were subsequently lined with limestone and carved in incised relief, in a style most comparable to that used in the earlier tomb of Mentuhotep\u2019s queen Neferu (TT 319); Khety\u2019s painted sarcophagus chamber is also similar in style to that of Neferu.80 The two stelae from the tomb, originally placed opposite each other on the walls of the corridor just inside the entrance, were decorated with the figure of Mentuhotep II in a fairly high raised relief similar to that of the final construction phase (D) in the king\u2019s own mortuary temple.81 Altogether, this combination of styles 79 Jaro\u00df-Deckert,\nJnj-jtj.f, p. 130 and pl. 10d.

Allen, Some Theban Officials of the Early Middle Kingdom\nplaces the decoration of Khety\u2019s tomb in a period contemporaneous with the last two decades of Mentuhotep II\u2014fully in accord with the historical evidence for Khety\u2019s career noted above. The tomb of Henenu (MMA 510 = TT 313) is the easternmost of the three largest tombs in the cliff north of the mortuary temple. Very little remains of its decoration. A fragment of incised relief from the entrance shows the figure of Henenu in a style somewhat less attenuated than that of Khety, with thicker arms and waist more like those found on the stela of Meru from Year 46.82 The low raised relief of Henenu\u2019s Stela A is also more advanced than that of Khety\u2019s stelae, and stylistically comparable to relief from the sanctuary of Mentuhotep II\u2019s mortuary temple; in concept and execution it appears to be somewhat earlier than the stela of Intef, son of Tjefi, which shows marked Memphite influence and is 83 perhaps the latest attributable to the reign of Mentuhotep II. Taken together, these features indicate that Henenu\u2019s tomb was decorated a few years after that of Khety. This is possible historically, since Khety and Henenu appear to be contemporaries. Other remains from the tomb, however, exhibit an earlier style. Henenu\u2019s Stela B, which was apparently placed opposite Stela A inside the vestibule of the tomb, was carved in a very high relief most closely paralleled in reliefs from the tomb of Neferu.84 The few remnants of his sarcophagus show that it was rather crudely painted on the interior with texts and object friezes; the latter include human figures, in the \u201cUpper Egyptian\u201d style exemplified elsewhere by coffins from Gebelein and 80\nR.

This evidence indicates that the decoration of Henenu\u2019s tomb was begun before that of Khety. The tombs of Khety and Henenu lie on either side of MMA 509, an unfinished tomb of the same type, whose owner is unknown. No decoration survives from this tomb, other than the cartouche of a king [...]\u00ccTP\u2014presumably Mentuhotep II\u2014inscribed on the wood door at its entrance.86 Its facade and entrance court are larger than those of either Khety or Henenu. The owners of these three tombs were clearly honored with the most favorable position in the row, closest to the king. Khety and Henenu appear to have been roughly of the same generation, although Henenu evidently survived somewhat longer. Between them, they shared responsibility for the management of the king\u2019s property, private (Khety) and state (Henenu). In view of the relationship and rank of these two tomb-owners, it seems probable that the unknown official buried in MMA 509 was of the same generation and equally high office\u2014 perhaps, therefore, the vizier Bebi, who apparently died during the final decoration of Mentuhotep II\u2019s mortuary temple. All three tombs lie east of the fieldstone wall that marked the eastern limit of the temple enclosure during its first two construction 87 phases (figs. 1\u20132). The courts of MMA 509 and 510 (Henenu) are aligned on an axis roughly parallel to this wall, suggesting that they were excavated during the same period. That of MMA 508 (Khety), however, is skewed some ten degrees to the east, even though it lies just to the east of the fieldstone wall. This indicates that it was laid out after the northeast corner of the \u201cshield-shaped\u201d enclosure wall, erected during construction phase C of the mortuary temple (figs. 1\u20132) was in place.88 If Khety\u2019s court had been built on the same orientation as MMA 509 and 510, the sightline up to the tomb\u2019s facade would have been partly 85 The fragments, which bear Henenu\u2019s title of mr pr, are unpublished: Winlock, MMA Theban Expedition Journal 3, pp. 147\u201350; photographs M7C 136\u201340.

The sarcophagus from Khety\u2019s tomb apparently had only horizontal dedicatory inscriptions around the exterior: Winlock, MMA Theban Expedition Journal 3, p. 86; drawing AM 713. 86 Winlock, BMMA 18 (1923), Part 2, p. 15 and fig. 5 (in situ); Hayes, Scepter 1, p. 257 and fig. 163 (MMA 23.3.174). A few fragments of raised relief found at the bottom of the cliff were identified as coming from MMA 509, but the attribution is uncertain: Winlock, MMA Theban Expedition Journal 3, p. 139; photograph M8C 221. 87 For the date of the wall, see Arnold, Tempel 1, p. 63; idem, Mentuhotep, pp. 8\u20139, 40. 88 For the date of the wall, see Arnold, Tempel 1, p. 65; idem, Mentuhotep, p. 41.\n20\n01 ALLEN Page 21 Friday, July 23, 2004 9:54 AM\nJames P. Allen, Some Theban Officials of the Early Middle Kingdom\n89 obscured by the northeast corner of this wall. Khety\u2019s tomb was therefore built later than MMA 509 and 510: if it had been the first tomb constructed in the row, it could easily have been located farther east, to better expose its court and facade to visitors coming from below. Before the construction of Khety\u2019s court, MMA 509 clearly had the most advantageous position with respect to the royal mortuary temple. This relationship, added to the evidence from the orientation of Khety\u2019s court, indicates that MMA 509 was the first tomb constructed in the north cliff. Its owner\u2014whether the vizier Bebi or some other high official\u2014evidently died before it was decorated. The tomb of Henenu may have been licensed either at the same time as MMA 509 or slightly later; in the first case, its position would indicate that Henenu\u2019s rank was in some respect junior to that of the anonymous owner of MMA 509. The insertion of Khety\u2019s tomb between MMA 509 and the mortuary temple could indicate that the owner of MMA 509 had died, but it may also reflect the close association with Mentuhotep that Khety presumably enjoyed as manager of the king\u2019s private estate. In this regard, the relationship of his tomb to the royal monument can be seen as antecedent to that between the later tombs of Meket-re and his storekeeper Wah. The tomb of Dagi (TT 103), Bebi\u2019s apparent successor, is not among those lining the north cliff; it lies instead to the south of the royal complex, on the north face of Sheikh Abd el-Qurna, directly opposite MMA\n89\nMMA 507, to the west of Khety\u2019s tomb, is almost certainly later, and therefore cannot have influenced the latter\u2019s position. This tomb, which consists of a number of \u201cgalleries\u201d off a central corridor, was the burial place of some sixty soldiers killed in battle: H.E. Winlock, The Slain Soldiers of Neb-\u00a2epet-Re\u2122 Mentu-\u00a2otpe, PMMA 16 (New York, 1945), pp. 1\u20136 and pl. 1. The grading of Khety\u2019s court buried a stairway of mudbrick whose axis, projected, points to the entrance of MMA 507 (ibid., p. 3 and pl. 1). Partly on the basis of this feature, Winlock dated the tomb to the reign of Mentuhotep II, and suggested that Khety\u2019s tomb was built later. The relationship of the stairway to the two tombs, however, is not certain. Winlock suggested that it could also have been built to facilitate the climb to Khety\u2019s tomb before the court was finished (ibid., p. 3); the problem cannot be settled without further excavation. More importantly, the prosopographic evidence from MMA 507 points convincingly to a Twelfth-Dynasty date. Linen recovered from the tomb bore private names clearly modelled after those of Amenemhat I and Senwosret I: s\u00a2tp-\u00a1b, \u221eprk\u00a3, and z-n-wsrt (ibid., pp. 28\u201330, nos. 17, 23, 29, 30, 33); cf.

Willems, \u201cThe Nomarchs of the Hare Nome and Early Middle Kingdom History,\u201d JEOL 28 (1983\u201384), pp. 98\u201399. Of the other large tombs to the west of Khety\u2019s, MMA 506 has a \u201cgallery\u201d substructure like MMA 507 (see Winlock, op. cit., pl. 1), and is evidently of the same date; it was largely empty when excavated: Winlock, MMA Theban Expedition Journal 3, p. 66. TT 310 = MMA 505 is discussed below.\n21\n01 ALLEN Page 22 Friday, July 23, 2004 9:54 AM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\n509 (fig. 1). Since the north cliff seems to have been originally designated for Mentuhotep\u2019s highest officials, this location may indicate that Dagi began the tomb before he became vizier. Evidence in favor of an earlier date exists in the tomb\u2019s plan, which is marked by a facade of pillars excavated from the bedrock and by a relatively short entrance corridor: the same features appear in tombs built prior to the latest phase of construction in the royal mortuary temple, such as that of the General Intef (TT 386).90 In Dagi\u2019s case, this plan was eventually altered: a limestone facing was applied to the walls of the statue chamber and entrance corridor, and extended out the door to the two central pillars, thus lengthening the corridor and placing the tomb\u2019s entrance directly at the end of the court rather than behind a row of pillars. The changes effectively converted the original plan to that of the higher-status tombs in the 91 north cliff, and were most likely initiated after Dagi\u2019s appointment as vizier. The decoration of Dagi\u2019s tomb consists of painting and relief, both generally exhibiting a style more advanced than that found in the tombs of Khety and Henenu.92 Of all the Theban tombs of this era, Dagi\u2019s is the first in which the paintings show the same degree of northern, \u201ccanonical\u201d influence as the relief, with figures more compactly proportioned than those of the post-unification Theban style.93 The carved decoration reflects even more strongly the influence of Memphite traditions.94 Although some fragments exhibit features reminiscent of earlier relief, such as that from Neferu\u2019s tomb,95 others are more evocative of later styles. The meticulous carving of interior details displayed in the feathers and uraei of a winged sundisk is characteristic of the art of Mentuhotep III.96 The relief of a row of seated men (usually identified as Dagi\u2019s sons) is lower and flatter than even the latest work from Mentuhotep II\u2019s mortuary temple, and more like that of the succeeding\n90\nArnold, Jnj-jtj.f, pp. 39\u201341.

As in the later relief of Meket-re, the figures appear almost as if they were pasted onto the stone rather than carved from it; the detailed painting of interior features that characterizes Meket-re\u2019s relief, however, is absent here.98 In its combination of earlier and later stylistic features, the decoration of Dagi\u2019s tomb undoubtedly belongs in the period between the death of Mentuhotep II and the beginning of Dyn. 12, and most probably in the reign of Mentuhotep III. This agrees with the historical evidence for Dagi\u2019s career as well as with the paleographic evidence from his sarcophagus, and makes it even more probable that his tenure as vizier extended from the final years of Mentuhotep II to the appointment of the vizier Amenemhat, perhaps as late as Year 2 of Mentuhotep IV. The probable length of Dagi\u2019s service as vizier makes it unlikely, in turn, that the vizier Ipi was in office before the first years of Amenemhat I\u2014a conclusion strengthened by the architectural features of Ipi\u2019s tomb, as noted above. In this light, however, the location of Ipi\u2019s tomb is seemingly anomalous: unlike the tomb of Meket-re, which dates from the same period, it was not constructed near the funerary monument of Amenemhat I,99 but lies instead among the tombs of Mentuhotep II\u2019s high officials, in the north cliff of Deir el-Bahari (fig. 2). Moreover, it is situated just west of the tomb of Meru, who began his career as mr \u221etmt\u00a1w under Mentuhotep II. From all indications, the two tombs (MMA 516\u2013517) were built at roughly the same time. Although they lie at the easternmost end of the cliff, both were clearly designed along the lines of the earlier tombs of Khety and Henenu to their west (MMA 508 and MMA 510), and display the same orientation as MMA 509\u2013510.100 Both have a plain facade equal in size to those of Khety and Henenu, and much the same interior plan,101 but neither was finished to the same extent.

The location of these intervening tombs, however, does not necessarily indicate that they were constructed before those of Ipi and Meru. The eastward turn of the cliff face in this region, reflected in the axes of all but MMA 511 (fig. 2), could well have been undesirable for the construction of tombs oriented to the mortuary temple of Mentuhotep II. Winlock notes that the rock in this area is badly faulted, and could also have been avoided for that reason (MMA Theban Expedition Journal 3, p. 158). 101 Arnold, Jnj-jtj.f, p. 45 and pl. 20.\n23\n01 ALLEN Page 24 Friday, July 23, 2004 9:54 AM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nsupplied with a rudimentary court; that of Meru exhibits only the excavated facade. Neither tomb was decorated. Meru\u2019s burial chamber is similar to that of Khety, lined with limestone and painted with texts; his sarcophagus, unlike Khety\u2019s, was painted on the interior with object friezes and texts.102 Ipi\u2019s tomb had only a sarcophagus and canopic chest, the former also decorated on the interior like Meru\u2019s.103 Despite their obvious similarity to the tombs of Khety and Henenu, however, the tombs of Ipi and Meru are separated from the latter not only by distance but also by the reigns of at least two kings (Mentuhotep III\u2013IV). As already noted, both are distinguished by features that date their construction to the first years of Dyn. 12, near the end of their owners\u2019 lives. Although Meru at least, if not Ipi as well, began his career in the final years of Mentuhotep II104 by the beginning of Dyn. 12 his association with this king may have become less important than another relationship to the mortuary temple\u2014the annual visit of Amun of Karnak \u201cin his first festivals of the summer, when he rises on the day of sailing to the Valley of nb-\u00a2pt-r\u2122.105 Of all the tombs in the north cliff, in fact, only MMA 508\u2013510 reflect a direct relationship with Mentuhotep II per se rather than with his mortuary temple. With the possible exception of MMA 511, the tombs east of Henenu\u2019s (MMA 510) may have been built where they are in order to allow their owners posthumously to partake in the benefits of Amun\u2019s annual visit to the temple. MMA 516 (Ipi) and 517 (Meru) may have been the first of these later tombs, to judge from their size and their location in the best area of the remaining cliff (see n. 100 above). Since they were built at about the same time, the precedence accorded Ipi\u2019s tomb probably reflects his higher official rank. In the sequence of early Middle Kingdom Theban tombs proposed here, the tomb of Meket-re is an apparent anomaly. If, as suggested 102\nThe burial chamber is unpublished: MMA Theban Expedition drawings AM 793\u201396; photographs M6C 32\u201337, M6C 223, M7C 203.

Thomas, ed., The American Discovery of Ancient Egypt (Los Angeles, forthcoming).\n24\n01 ALLEN Page 25 Friday, July 23, 2004 9:54 AM\nJames P. Allen, Some Theban Officials of the Early Middle Kingdom\nabove, it is contemporary with the tombs of Ipi and Meru, why are the latter two not located in the new royal valley south of the Assasif\u2014or conversely, why was Meket-re\u2019s tomb not built in the same row on the north cliff? Dieter Arnold\u2019s study of these tombs has suggested a possible answer.106 Some sixty meters to the west of Khety\u2019s tomb lies an unfinished tomb that was apparently never occupied (MMA 505 = TT 310). Although it was evidently planned along the lines of MMA 508\u2013510, with the same orientation to the temple of Mentuhotep II, its position is clearly less advantageous, and for that reason alone it is probably later in date.107 Its substructure is also different from those of the tombs to its east: where the latter have a sloping corridor leading from the back wall of the antechamber to the burial chamber, the burial chamber of MMA 505 is reached via a deep shaft in the floor of the antechamber. Among the Theban tombs of the early Middle Kingdom, the clearest analogue of this plan is to be found in the tomb of Meket-re. On that basis, Arnold has suggested that MMA 505 may have been originally intended for the burial of Meket-re but was abandoned before completion in favor of a site closer to the new mortuary temple of Amenemhat I.108 Apart from the architectural evidence, Arnold\u2019s theory has much to recommend it. The identification of MMA 505 as Meket-re\u2019s original tomb places it squarely in the sequence of tomb development already exemplified by the tombs of his contemporaries Ipi and Meru. Its plan indicates that it was begun after the latter two tombs\u2014like the tomb of Meru, therefore, only toward the end of its owner\u2019s life. This may account in part for its location on the cliff, though it also usurps the favored position of Meket-re\u2019s predecessor, Khety, closest to the temple. The latter may have been the more important factor, since Meket-re\u2019s new tomb near the mortuary temple of Amenemhat I has the same relationship to the royal monument. The fact that Meket-re was able to abandon MMA 509 and at least begin work on his final resting place in the south valley suggests that he lived somewhat longer into the Twelfth Dynasty than Ipi and Meru. In the dynastic system that we have adopted from Manetho, it is often too easy to forget that the lives of real people lie behind the historical change from one dynasty to another. The beginning of the Middle 106 Arnold,\nJnj-jtj.f, p. 45 and 41 n. 162. was Winlock\u2019s conclusion: MMA Theban Expedition Journal 3, p. 64. 108 Arnold dated MMA 505 to the reign of Mentuhotep II and TT 280 to that of his successor, Mentuhotep III (n. 106, above). The chronology has since been revised by the more recent study of Arnold, MMJ 26 (1991). 107 This\n25\n01 ALLEN Page 26 Friday, July 23, 2004 9:54 AM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nKingdom, from the third decade of Mentuhotep II to the first of Amenemhat I, encompassed only some forty years\u2014well within the lifetime of many officials, as the careers of Meket-re and Meru show. Of the high officials attested under Mentuhotep II, some, such as Bebi and Khety, probably did not outlive him. Others, however, seem to have belonged to a younger generation, whose political careers were only beginning in the final years of Mentuhotep II. These officials, including Meket-re, Dagi, and Meru, served through the end of Dyn. 11 and, in some cases, into the beginning of Dyn. 12. Such men, as much as the kings they served, were the founders of the Middle Kingdom.\nb\n26\n02 ALTENMULLER Page 27 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:31 PM\nGeburtsschrein und Geburtshaus\nHartwig Altenm\u00fcller\nD\nie Stiftung eines Geburtsschreins unter Amenemhet II.

Bettlauben erinnern. Sein oberer Wandabschlu\u00df wird, und dies ist ungew\u00f6hnlich im Alten Reich, durch einen Cheker-fries gebildet, der auch in den Abbildungen der Bettlauben zu beobachten ist. Die Zweiteilung des Bauwerks in einen vorderen und einen hinteren Raum wird auch durch die Wanddekoration angedeutet. Am Eingang werden der Grabherr und seine Frau bei der Entgegennahme von Kultger\u00e4t, Stoffen und K\u00e4sten (ibid., Taf. 96\u201399) und beim Empfang von Lebensmitteln (ibid., Taf. 78\u201382) gezeigt. Im hinteren Raumabschnitt sind in aufeinander folgenden Szenen das Herrichten des Bettes und der Gang zur Bettlaube (ibid., Taf. 91\u201395) dargestellt. Ebenfalls in den hinteren Raumabschnitt geh\u00f6ren die Szenen von Musik und Tanz vor einer Statue des Grabherrn (ibid., Tf. 83\u201387 + Tf. 97A). Alle diese Bilder geben einen Hinweis auf das reale Geschehen. Das abgebildete und gefeierte Ereignis ist das Zusammensein des Grabherrn mit seiner Frau mit dem Ziel von Zeugung und Geburt.

Interkolumien zwischen den S\u00e4ulen versperren den Blick auf den Kernbau und erinnern in ihrer Funktion an die Matten der Bettlauben des Alten Reiches. Die Mammisis sind f\u00fcr die Geburt des G\u00f6tterkindes bestimmt. Gute Gr\u00fcnde sprechen f\u00fcr die Annahme, da\u00df der Geburtsschrein (s\u00dfdt nt mst) in der Totenkultanlage von Amenemhet II. eines der Zwischenglieder in der baugeschichtlichen Entwicklungsreihe von den Bettlauben des Alten Reiches bis hin zu den Mammisis der Sp\u00e4tzeit ist. Es ist daher naheliegend, diesen Geburtsschrein des Mittleren Reiches sich wie die Bettlaube des Alten Reiches und das Mammi der Sp\u00e4tzeit als Zweiraumkonstruktion vorzustellen. Dadurch er\u00f6ffnen sich neue M\u00f6glichkeiten zur Erkl\u00e4rung der in den Geburtsschrein hinein gestifteten b\u00a3\u00a2yt und \u00a2\u00a3w-\u221etm genannten Gegenst\u00e4nde. Die b\u00a3\u00a2yt k\u00f6nnten 19 etwas, das \u201cvorne\u201d (m-b\u00a3\u00a2), d.h. im \u201cVorraum,\u201d ist, benennen und die 20 \u00a2\u00a3w-\u221etm-Art etwas, das sich \u201chinten\u201d (\u00a2\u00a3), d.h. im \u201cHauptraum,\u201d befindet. Trotz der m\u00f6glichen Verteilung der b\u00a3\u00a2yt und \u00a2\u00a3w-\u221etm genannten Gegenst\u00e4nde auf Vor- und Hauptraum eines Geburtsschreins des Mittleren Reiches bleibt zun\u00e4chst unklar, was genau die b\u00a3\u00a2yt und \u00a2\u00a3w-\u221etm sind. Zur n\u00e4heren Bestimmung mu\u00df daher das f\u00fcr beide W\u00f6rter verwendete gleichartige Determinativ herangezogen werden. Dieses zeigt einen querrechteckigen schmalen Gegenstand, dessen Bedeutung allerdings nur schwer zu erkennen ist. Aufgrund der Tatsache, da\u00df die W\u00e4nde der Bettlauben des Alten Reiches aus Vorh\u00e4ngen oder Matten bestehen, ist zu \u00fcberlegen, ob die als b\u00a3\u00a2yt und \u00a2\u00a3w-\u221etm bezeichneten Gegenst\u00e4nde Vorh\u00e4nge oder Matten des Vorraums und Hauptraums darstellen. Unwillk\u00fcrlich denkt man dann bei dem f\u00fcr beide W\u00f6rter verwendeten querrechteckigen Determinativ an einen Vorhangkasten, wie er im Alten Reich im Zusammenhang mit dem Bettbaldachin der K\u00f6nigin Hetepheres gefunden worden 21 ist. Dieser besitzt eine L\u00e4nge von 157,5 cm (= 3 Ellen), eine Tiefe von 21,5 cm und eine H\u00f6he von 18,5 cm, hat also l\u00e4ngliches Format und ist als Vorbild f\u00fcr das Determinativ zu den b\u00a3\u00a2yt und \u00a2\u00a3w-\u221etm-Gegenst\u00e4nden durchaus geeignet.

Wird darin die L\u00f6sung gesehen, k\u00f6nnten die mit dem Vorraum in Verbindung gebrachten b\u00a3\u00a2yt luftige und leichte Vorh\u00e4nge be22 zeichen , w\u00e4hrend die \u00a2\u00a3w-\u221etm genannten Vorh\u00e4nge des Hauptraums als geschlossene (\u221etm) Matten die Funktion von W\u00e4nden gehabt haben. Es wird sich weiter unten zeigen, da\u00df allem Anschein nach die \u00a2\u00a3w-\u221etm des Hauptraums Darstellungen aufnehmen konnten. Die Verteilung der angenommenen Vorh\u00e4nge (b\u00a3\u00a2yt) und Matten (\u00a2\u00a3w-\u221etm) auf Vor- und Hauptraum pa\u00dft sich der Struktur der in Skelettbauweise errichteten Holz-Matten-Konstruktion an. Jeweils 3 b\u00a3\u00a2yt waren auf den beiden Seiten des Vorraums angebracht, davon 2 auf der L\u00e4ngsseite und 1 an der Fassade und neben der T\u00fcr. Die 15 \u00a2\u00a3w-\u221etm des Hauptraums waren so verteilt, da\u00df sich je ein \u00a2\u00a3w-\u221etm neben der Eingangst\u00fcr, 3 \u00a2\u00a3w-\u221etm auf der R\u00fcckseite und jeweils 5 \u00a2\u00a3w-\u221etm an den L\u00e4ngsseiten des Hauptraums befanden (Abb. 3). Aus der Anordnung der 6 Vorh\u00e4nge (b\u00a3\u00a2yt) und 15 Matten (\u00a2\u00a3w-\u221etm) lassen sich dann auch die ungef\u00e4hren Ausma\u00dfe des Geb\u00e4udes errechnen. Sofern b\u00a3\u00a2yt und \u00a2\u00a3w\u221etm jeweils die Breite des Vorhangs der Hetepheres I. von 1,575 m (= 3 Ellen) gehabt haben, ergibt sich f\u00fcr den Geburtsschrein Amenemhets II. eine Gesamtl\u00e4nge von 7 Vorhangsbreiten (11,025 m; 21 Ellen) und eine Gesamtbreite von 3 Vorhangsbreiten (4,725 m; 9 Ellen). Die auf diese Weise errechneten Gr\u00f6\u00dfenverh\u00e4ltnisse stimmen fast exakt mit den Raumma\u00dfen des bei Mereruka als Nachbildung eines Geburtsraums an23 gesprochenen Raums A.10 \u00fcberein, der 11 m (= 21 Ellen) lang ist. Die Funktion des Geburtsschreins in der Kultanlage des Toten\u2013 tempels Obwohl der Geburtsschrein (s\u00dfdt nt mst) im Totentempel bisher nur inschriftlich f\u00fcr den Totentempel Amenemhets II. nachgewiesen werden kann, haben solche Institutionen mit Sicherheit bereits im AR 24 existiert. Diese haben in der Architektur der Totentempel des Alten Reiches allerdings keine sicher identifizierbaren Spuren hinterlassen. Dennoch ist es m\u00f6glich, ihr Bildprogramm zu bestimmen und die Dekoration zu rekonstruieren.\n22 B\u00a3\u00a2yt\nbezeichnet Schurze oder Perlengeh\u00e4nge: vgl.

Die eine Version ist mythenfrei und d\u00fcrfte den Sachverhalt so darstellen, wie er in den Privatgr\u00e4bern des Alten Reiches zu beobachten ist; die andere Version verlegt das Ereignis in die G\u00f6tterwelt und d\u00fcrfte das Geschehen in der gleichen Art wie im Zyklus von \u201cder Geburt des Gottk\u00f6nigs\u201d aus25 deuten. Dieser Bilderzyklus ist zwar erst seit dem Neuen Reich bekannt, geht aber nachweislich auf Vorlagen aus einer Zeit noch vor 26 der 4. Dynastie zur\u00fcck, so da\u00df er zeitlich in das Bildprogramm der Totentempel des Alten und Mittleren Reiches passen w\u00fcrde. Positiv f\u00fcr diesen zweiten Bildtyp spricht, da\u00df zwei der erhaltenen Exemplare des Neuen Reiches (Hatschepsut, Ramses II.) in einem k\u00f6niglichen 27 RamesTotentempel aufgezeichnet worden sind (Deir el Bahari, 28 seum ) und daher im gleichen funktionalen Zusammenhang stehen wie die anzunehmenden Exemplare des Alten und Mittleren Reiches. Eine f\u00fcr die Geburt des G\u00f6tterkindes redaktionell \u00fcberarbeitete und umgedeutete neue Fassung des Zyklus findet sich in den Mammisis des 29 sp\u00e4ten \u00c4gypten. Ein direkter Nachweis f\u00fcr die Ausschm\u00fcckung eines Geburtsschreins des Alten und Mittleren Reiches mit dem Bildzyklus der \u201cGeburt des Gottk\u00f6nigs\u201d kann bisher nicht gef\u00fchrt werden. Dennoch lassen sich f\u00fcr die Zusammengeh\u00f6rigkeit von Geburtsschrein und Bildzyklus wichtige Indizien anf\u00fchren. Der Zyklus besteht in den vollst\u00e4ndigen Exemplaren von Hatschepsut in Deir el Bahari und von Amenophis III. in Luxor aus 15 Bildern, die wegen ihrer auff\u00e4lligen Anzahl mit den 15 \u00a2\u00a3w24 Den deutlichsten Hinweis darauf geben die Titel der k\u00f6niglichen Frauen (Prinzessinnen,\nK\u00f6nigsgemahlinnen, K\u00f6nigsm\u00fctter), die mit dem Namen des Totentempels bei der Pyramide gebildet sind.

Dargestellt werden die Zeugung, die Geburt und die Annahme des sp\u00e4ter zum K\u00f6nig berufenen Kindes durch den Gott. Am Zyklus beteiligt sind der g\u00f6ttliche Vater, die K\u00f6nigsmutter und das Kind. Eine Abbildung des g\u00f6ttlichen Vaters findet sich in Sz. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11 und 14, ein Bild der K\u00f6nigsmutter in Sz. 1, 4, 7, 8, 9 und 12; das Kind wird in Sz. 6 vor der Geburt und in den Sz. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 nach der Geburt gezeigt. Verteilt man die Szenen in der Reihenfolge des Zyklus von Deir el Bahari von links nach rechts auf die 15 Felder des rekonstruierten Geburtsschreins gelangt das Geschehen vor der Geburt auf die linke Wand (Sz. 1, 2\u20136), die eigentliche Geburt (Sz. 7\u20139) auf die R\u00fcckwand\u2014dort unter Verschr\u00e4nkung der Sz. 7\u20139\u20138\u2014und das Geschehen nach der Geburt auf die linken Wand (Sz. 10\u201314, 15) (Abb. 4). Der 30 g\u00f6ttliche Vater geht in das Innere des Geburtsschreins hinein, die im Inneren des Schreins vorgestellte Mutter blickt nach au\u00dfen; das Kind wird mit Blick nach au\u00dfen dargestellt. Eine vergleichbare Disposition 31 findet sich in den Mammisis der Sp\u00e4tzeit. Durch eine derartige Verteilung der Szenen von der \u201cGeburt des Gottk\u00f6nigs\u201d auf die 15 Felder des Geburtsschreins gelangen die Szenen mit der auf einem Bett sitzenden K\u00f6nigsmutter stets in eine Mittelposition: In der Mitte der rechten Wand befindet sich das Bett f\u00fcr die Zeugung (Sz. 4), in der Mitte der gegen\u00fcberliegenden linken Wand das Bett f\u00fcr das Stillen des Kindes durch die K\u00f6nigin und die Ammen (Sz. 12) und in der Mitte der R\u00fcckwand wird die Geburt auf einem Bett dargestellt (Sz. 9). Die zentrale Wandposition der Szenen mit dem als L\u00f6wenbett gestalteten Bett l\u00e4\u00dft nur eine Erkl\u00e4rung zu: Hier liegt die g\u00f6tterweltliche Ausdeutung jener Szene vor, die in den Privatgr\u00e4bern des Alten Reiches 32 durch das Bett in der Bettlaube angezeigt ist. Auch bei der Verteilung der \u00fcbrigen Szenen ist eine sinnvolle Anordnung zu erkennen, die die Rekonstruktion des Bildprogramms des Geburtsschreins hervorragend unterst\u00fczt. Der g\u00f6ttliche Vater tritt in das Innere des Geburtsschreins ein, um die K\u00f6nigsmutter aufzusuchen, und 30\nDies gilt auch wohl auch f\u00fcr die Sz. 1 und die beiden Sz. 10\u201311, die in Deir el Bahari seitenverkehrt, d.h. gegen die Zyklusrichtung, dargestellt sind. 31 In Luxor steht der Bildzyklus auf der Westwand von Raum XIII (PM II2, 326\u2013327 (152)). Die Vorlage von Sz. 1, 2\u20136 war f\u00fcr eine rechte Wand, die von Sz. 7\u20139 f\u00fcr eine R\u00fcckwand und die von Sz. 10\u201314, 15\u2014weil seitenverkehrt\u2014f\u00fcr eine linke Wand bestimmt.

Die Bedeutung der Geburtsh\u00e4user in den Totentempeln und Zusammenfassung Die bis hierher gef\u00fchrten Untersuchungen haben gezeigt, da\u00df unter dem Namen Geburtsschrein (s\u00dfdt nt mst) im Mittleren Reich eine Einrichtung belegt ist, die mit der Bettlaube der Privatgr\u00e4ber des Alten Reiches verglichen werden kann. Auf die Existenz solcher Einrichtungen in den k\u00f6niglichen Totentempeln verweisen die seit der 6. Dynastie bis zum Beginn des Mittleren Reiches mit dem Namen des Pyramidenbezirks gebildeten Titel der Frauen des K\u00f6nigshauses. Bauliche Formen des Geburtsschreins sind im Alten und Mittleren Reich allerdings bisher noch nicht mit Sicherheit nachgewiesen. Die urspr\u00fcngliche Bedeutung der Geburtsschreine erschlie\u00dft sich aus dem Zyklus der \u201cGeburt des Gottk\u00f6nigs.\u201d Das mit diesem Ereignis verbundene Ritual dient dem Nachweis der G\u00f6ttlichkeit des regierenden K\u00f6nigs. Ort der Handlung ist der Totentempel, vermutlich weil dort die G\u00f6ttlichkeit des K\u00f6nigs fr\u00fchzeitig und am deutlichsten nach au\u00dfen hin dargestellt werden kann. Die ersten Festfeiern werden eng mit der Thronbesteigung des K\u00f6nigs verbunden gewesen sein. Denn erst mit der Kr\u00f6nung erf\u00fcllt sich die in die Vergangenheit zur\u00fcck zu datierende Folge der Ereignisse, in deren Verlauf das Kind durch den Gott gezeugt, als Sohn angenommen und als Herrscher bestimmt worden ist. Die Darstellung dieses Mythos in Form eines Rituals ist f\u00fcr das Alte Reich zwar ungew\u00f6hnlich, hat aber im Dramatischen Ramesseumpapy35 rus ihre Parallele. Die flachbildlichen Darstellungen von privaten Geburtsschreinen sind in den Gr\u00e4bern von hohen Beamten des Alten Reiches seit der 4. Dynastie belegt. Ihre dreidimensionale Umsetzung in Stein findet sich in einigen Mastabas der 6. Dynastie.

Simpson, whose work is so closely connected with problems of the art and architecture of the Old and Middle Kingdom.1 Since 1842, remains of monolithic papyrus bundle, palm capital and Hathor(-Sistrum) columns have been uncovered in temples of Ramesses II and kings of the Third Intermediate and Late Period in the Faiyum and Delta. These columns certainly originated in older buildings, and are generally believed to have been removed from Old and Middle Kingdom Memphite pyramid temples.2 Unfortunately very few columns have been adequately measured or recorded and several of them have remained unpublished. The major examples are listed below (cf. fig. 1). Palm capital columns During the Old and Middle Kingdom there was a preference for granite columns, while between the Eighteenth and Twenty-first Dynasties new granite columns were rarely made, leading to the conclusion that most of the columns described below have an early date.3 Palm capital columns are not known from Middle Kingdom temples but do appear in three pyramid temples of the Fifth Dynasty (Sahura, Djedkara and Unas) and a temple of Niuserra, suggesting that all reused granite palm capital columns originated from the Old Kingdom. Tanis 1I\nwish to thank Adela Oppenheim for her comments. P. Uphill, The Temples of Per Ramesses (Warminster, 1984), was the first to collect and systematically study the question of older building material in the various Delta sites. His data base is of great importance and quoted below as Uphill, no.

Parts of probably four monolithic columns are preserved with nine fronds (without barbs). Their style and perfect execution indicate that they date to the Old Kingdom and were usurped by Ramesses II with additional inscriptions by Merenptah. Possibly they alternated with papyrus bundle columns of limestone. Since the limestone columns are attested by only two fragments the date of their manufacture cannot be determined. 2) Court of the temple of Anta (fig. 1[4]) In the precinct of the temple of Anta six granite palm capital columns were found, which probably formed a kiosk.5 Some capitals have fronds with barbs, while others do not include these details. The abaci were round, a highly unusual feature in Egyptian architecture that is also found on the columns from the East Temple (see below). The columns are dated by their style and perfect execution to the Old Kingdom and were usurped by Ramesses II. The total height was 6.70 m (including abacus), the width of the abacus 1.04 m. Two broken and incomplete columns are now in the Egyptian Museum Cairo, while one column is in the Louvre.6 3) East Temple Ten more granite palm capital columns with barbed fronds were found by Mariette in the so-called East Temple, usurped by Ramesses II and reused by Osorkon II. The abaci were from different blocks and inserted into the square sockets of the capitals. The round abaci and similar dimensions suggest that the columns have the same origin as those in the temple of Anta. The columns had a height of 7.0 m, an upper diameter of 0.817 m, and a lower diameter of 0.955 m.7 4 W.M.\nFlinders Petrie, Tanis 1 (London, 1885), p. 14; idem, Tanis 2 (London, 1888), pp. 10, 27\u201328, pl. 5; Pierre Montet, Les nouvelles fouilles de Tanis (1929\u20131932) (Paris, 1933), pp. 63\u201369, pls. 28, 31; idem, Le lac sacr\u00e9 de Tanis (Paris, 1966), pp. 21\u201331; Uphill, T. 43\u201346; Tanis, l\u2019\u00f4r des pharaons, exhibition catalogue (Paris, 1987), fig. on p. 29. 5 Montet, Nouvelles Fouilles, pp. 95\u2013101, pls. 45\u201347 [upper], inscriptions pls. 48\u201353; Studies Presented to F.Ll.

The excavation reports of Edouard Naville and Labib Habachi indicate that this area contained fragments of at least four monolithic, granite palm capital columns from the Old Kingdom.8 They were reinscribed by Ramesses II and Osorkon II.9 Petrie gives their dimensions as 6.34 m high (including the abacus, but without the base of about 0.15 cm) with a 99 cm wide abacus and a diameter of 95 cm at the foot.10 One column is now in the British Museum (1065).11 Smaller versions of the same type of column were found in the Hall of the Sed-Festival Gate but they were not documented.12 2) Temple of Mihos In the small temple of Mihos was found a group of seven granite palm capital columns (and two papyrus bundle columns), inscribed by Osorkon II. One fragment is of quartzite. Habachi assumed that because of their small size and poor quality, these columns might have been produced for Osorkon II. Habachi estimated their height to have been about 4.25 m.13 Herakleopolis Magna (Ihnasya el-Medina) (fig. 1[3]) In 1892(?) Naville excavated parts of the Herishef temple at Herakleopolis magna, uncovering a group of at least six palm capital columns. The matching bases of the columns, which formed a pronaos of two rows of eight columns, were excavated in 1904 by Petrie.14 The columns were monolithic, granite palm capital columns usurped by Ramesses II from an older building and later reinscribed by Merenptah; they were found in association with blocks of the Old Kingdom as well as Middle Kingdom blocks of Senwosret II. and III.

Gamal El-Din Mokhtar suggests (from field observations?) that the twenty-four columns of the hypostyle hall behind the pronaos were also palm capital columns, allowing for a total of forty columns. From the lower diameter of the hypostyle hall columns (1.2\u2013 1.3 m) one can estimate a height of at least 7\u20138 m, which is considerably higher than the pronaos columns. The central aisle of the hypostyle hall was not higher than the side aisles. Complete columns of the pronaos are now in the British Museum (1123)15 and in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (91.259).16 Incomplete columns are in the Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide, The Manchester Museum, the Bolton Museum and Art Gallery (United Kingdom), and in the University of Pennsylvania Museum, Philadelphia (636).17 Cairo Several Cairo mosques include reused pharaonic palm capital columns of granite, which were probably removed from the ruins at Heliopolis and Memphis, and perhaps include some from Memphite pyramid temples of the Old Kingdom. The following examples are mentioned in literature:18 a) The Mosque of Amir Altunbuga al-Maridani (739\u201340/1339\u201340) includes columns taken from the Rashida Mosque outside Old Cairo (founded 393/1003). The Maqsura has eight granite columns, two of which are complete palm columns; four have palm column shafts only and were topped with Corinthian and late Egyptian composite capitals. Three more palm column shafts are visible at the court front of the Qibla-Riwaq.19\n15 Budge,\nGuide, Sculpture, pp. 164\u201365 [599].

Traces of the name of Niuserra on one of the columns confirm their Fifth Dynasty origin. b) A few granite fragments from the East Temple can be reconstructed to form a 90 cm high capital with an upper shaft diameter of 73 cm. The capital had bundles of secondary buds and seems to originate from the Middle Kingdom.25 Bubastis 1) The Main Temple of Bastet (fig. 1[1]) The above-mentioned hypostyle hall or colonnaded court behind the Sed-festival gate of Osorkon II also contained fragments of at least four monolithic, granite papyrus bundle columns, found together with parts of granite architraves (some now in the British Museum), usurped by Ramesses II from Senwosret III.26 None of the columns was completely preserved, but from the size of the only published capital one can estimate an original height of about 7\u20138 m (including the abacus).

The upper parts of the columns and capitals were missing, but Habachi estimated their original height to have been about 7.20 m. Two column shafts are now in the garden of the Egyptian Museum, Cairo. Herakleopolis Magna (Ihnasya el-Medina) In front of the gateway of an unidentified temple at the Kom el-Ak\u00e2rib, four granite bundled papyrus columns are still standing. Originally inscribed by Queen Sobeknofrure, they were cut in half and reused probably by Ramesses II.31 The gateway itself contains about ten huge granite beams which may have the same origin as the columns. Two colossal statues were also found in the area; they were usurped by Ramesses II and are thought to have originated from the time of Senwosret III. The columns have never been measured. Hathor capital columns Hathor capital or Sistrum columns appear in temples of female gods of all periods. From the Eightenth Dynasty onward, the capital shows the face of Hathor on all four sides and is capped by a chapel. Examples with the Hathor faces on two opposite sides and without the chapel are believed to be of Middle Kingdom origin. Only the latter type will be considered here. Bubastis At least nine Hathor capital columns were recorded in the area of the hypostyle hall of the temple of Bastet at Bubastis.32 They are inscribed with the names of Ramesses II and/or Osorkon II. They were found in three sizes: a) Five or more, granite Hathor capitals of Osorkon II were 7 ft. high (= 2.13 m) and had Hathor faces on two opposite sides.

They were inscribed with the name of Osorkon II, and were said to be \u201csmaller and more simple.\u201d Labib Habachi, however, states that the head in Sydney had \u201calmost\u201d the same dimensions as those of the first group. One capital is now in Sydney, Australia. c) One complete red granite capital along with fragments of others were found by Labib Habachi in 1939 in the Bastet temple. The Hathor faces are on two opposite sides, while one other side was decorated with the lily and the other with the papyrus symbols. The 1.43 m high capital was inscribed with the name of Osorkon II and is now in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo (JdE 72134). The columns described above, as well as other building elements (architraves, door frames, wall blocks) and statuary, are usually said to have originated from the pyramid complexes of the memphite area. They would have been removed either by Amenemat I or later by Ramesses II to new construction sites in the Delta and elsewhere.33 Some of them were again reused by rulers of the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Dynasties at Tanis. We now have to ask the question, whether or not the approximately fifty-five remaining, reused palm capital columns described above could be accommodated in the Memphite pyramid temples, given the number of missing palm columns. Three pyramid temples of the Old Kingdom contained such columns (Sahura, Ddjekara and Unas). In the Sahura pyramid temple, eleven of sixteen 6.40 m high columns from the court of the pyramid temple were found when the complex was excavated in 1907.34 The valley temple has a maximum of eight empty positions, but the column types used in this building are unknown.35 The pyramid temple of Djedkara contained sixteen palm capital columns, of which an undetermined number lie broken at the site.

Eight more palm capital columns might have been placed in the unexcavated valley temple, increasing the number of empty positions to a maximum of eighteen. However, J.-Ph. Lauer assumes that the missing Djedkara columns were reused in the pyramid temple of Unas.36 Eighteen 6.30 m high palm capital columns were erected in the pyramid temple of Unas, seven of which were found at the site.37 His valley temple may have contained ten palm capital columns, two of which were reerected in the 1970s.38 The missing palm capital columns can be summarized as follows: Sahura:\nDjedkara: Unas: Total:\n5 columns in court of main temple Perhaps 8 columns in valley temple 18 columns 11 columns 8 columns 50 missing palm columns\nh. 6.45 m h. 6.45 m(?) h. 5.25 m(?) h. 6.30 m h. 6.30 m(?)\nThe figure of 50 missing columns is exceeded by the 55 existing, reused columns, which must represent a small percentage of the original one to two hundred columns. Another issue is the height of the columns. A comparison of the missing and the existing columns shows that the reused columns are generally higher than those found in the pyramid temples. The columns of Tanis 1 are\u2014at 11.00 m\u2014nearly double the height of those from the pyramid temples (5.25\u20136.45 m). The only exception is the columns of the Pronaos of Herakleopolis, which, at 5.38 m, are close in height to those from the temple of Djedkara (5.25 m?). The following evidence also refutes the assumption that the reused papyrus bundle columns came from pyramid temples of the Middle Kingdom:\n36 A. Labrousse, J.-Ph. Lauer, and J.

The pyramid temple of Amenemhat III at Dahshur contained another granite papyrus bundle column, the shaft of which is now in the Egyptian Museum Cairo.40 According to Lepsius\u2019 reconstruction,41 the granite and limestone papyrus bundle columns in the \u201clabyrinth\u201d of Amenemhat III at Hawara were about 6.30 m and 7.9 m high. These latter columns would offer the closest parallels to those found reused at Tanis and Bubastis, but since Greek and Roman travellers describe the labyrinth as being intact to the height of the roof, the columns cannot have been removed before that time. That the Hathor columns of Bubastis did not originate from pyramid temples is certain, since we have no evidence that such columns were used in these buildings.42 This discussion should make it clear that the pyramid complexes of the Old and Middle Kingdom cannot have been the origin of the reused columns. An alternative solution, that the columns could have been removed from other temples in the Memphite region, must also be eliminated. During the pharaonic period, older temples were only demolished to make way for a larger substitute. The idea that Amenemhat I would have replaced older Memphite temples with grander new buildings and shipped the old material to build (less important?) temples in the Delta seems unlikely. The only convincing alternative would be to assume that the older building material originated from the same sites where it was reused. Since nearly all these sites have longstanding cult and building traditions, the existence of Old and Middle Kingdom temples is not extraordinary. This assumption does not exclude the possibility that building material was occasionally transferred between neighbouring sites such as Tell ed-Dab\u2122a, Qantir and Tanis.43 39\nDieter Arnold, The Pyramid of Senwosret I (New York, 1988), p. 47. Twelve stems. Lower diameter 0.93 m, height unknown. 40 In my publication, Der Pyramidenbezirk des K\u00f6nigs Amenemhet III. in Dahschur (Mainz am Rhein, 1987), pp. 61\u201363 (pl. 60), I suggested that the court of the pyramid temple was surrounded by a number of such columns. Based on the evidence collected in the temple of his predecessor Senwosret III at Dahshur, I assume now that no such court existed and the Cairo granite column stood in the square antechamber; perhaps 2\u20134 limestone papyrus bundle columns were placed in a porticus. 41 LD 1, pl. 47, Text 2, pp. 16\u201317; Ludwig Borchardt, Die \u00e4gyptische Pflanzens\u00e4ule (Berlin, 1897), pp. 31\u201332, fig. 55. One fragment in Berlin (no. 1167). Some magnificent fragments are still at the site. 42 The cult of Hathor generated such columns, however, in the mortuary temples of Hatshepsut, Thutmosis III and Amenhotep III at Thebes.\n49\n03 ARNOLD Page 50 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:37 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nA study of the reuse of Old Kingdom material cannot omit the question of the origin of the Old Kingdom blocks found reused in the pyramid complex of Amenemhat I at Lisht.44 The decoration and inscriptions of these blocks do not include subjects found exclusively in royal cult and pyramid temples (such as offering lists, the king at the offering table, scenes from the square antechamber). On the contrary, the subjects of the reliefs are found in royal or divine temples that are not associated with burial places. The potential existence of one or more Old Kingdom temples in the area of El-Lisht, ancient Itj-tawy, helps to explain the presence of blocks dating to Cheops, Chephren, Userkaf, Unas and Pepi II. This hypothetical building of the Old Kingdom would have been dismantled during the coregency of Amenemhat I and Senwosret I in order to make room for projects connected with the building of the new residence. It is significant that granite architraves and probably pillars but no columns of the Old Kingdom were found reused in the pyramid complex of Amenemhat I. If the Old Kingdom structure contained columns, they were apparently left in place. The available material suggests that at least four hypostyle halls existed during the Old and Middle Kingdom in a) the area of Tanis\u2013 Qirqafa\u2013Tell el-Dab\u2122a, b) at Bubastis (cf. fig. 2), c) at Crocodilopolis and d) at Herakleopolis. There is no doubt that more hypostyle halls existed at places such as Memphis, and Heliopolis, but the evidence for them is meager.45 a) If one assumes that all columns found reused at Tanis originated in the same building,46 one could reconstruct a hypostyle hall of 4 x 4 (or 43 I\ndo not intend to suggest identifying Tanis with Avaris/Pi-Ramesse, a theory that was convincingly disproven by Manfred Bietak, Tell el-Dab\u2122a 2 (Vienna, 1975), pp. 179\u201388. The possibility of Old and Middle Kingdom structures at a hitherto unexplored part of the enormous tell of Tanis cannot be completely ruled out; cf. A. L\u00e9zine, \u201cLe temple nord de Tanis\u201d K\u00eami 12 (1952), p. 54, n. 3. 44 See Hans Goedicke, Re-used Blocks from the Pyramid of Amenemhet I at Lisht (New York, 1971). A few more were not included in this publication and seven more were found in excavations at the pyramid in 1991. Another example is the reuse of temple blocks of Djedkara in the pyramid of Unas, see Labrousse et al., Le temple haut du complexe fun\u00e9raire du roi Ounas, pp. 124\u201329. 45 The author is aware of the completely hypothetical character of the reconstructions offered. They are meant to attract fresh attention to a unique assembly of monuments that need better documentation and investigation. 46 Montet considered this possibility in his Le lac sacr\u00e9 de Tanis, pp. 23\u201324. No traces of actual buildings before the Twenty-first Dynasty have been found at Tanis proper. Earlier remains, if existing, would have been removed when the foundation pits of the Twentyfirst Dynasty temples were dug, and again when the temple foundations were torn out by stone robbbers.\n50\n03 ARNOLD Page 51 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:37 PM\nDieter Arnold, Hypostyle Halls of the Old and Middle Kingdom?\nFig. 2.

A hypostyle hall would have been added in the Sixth Dynasty; the roof of this hall would have been supported by the four + x larger palm columns found in the area. The interior height of the hall of about 12.34 m suggests a total exterior height of about 13 m (25 cubits would be 13.125 m), a dimension only surpassed by the pronaoi of later temples at Esna (14.98 m) and Edfu (15.67 m). The proportions of the columns are astonishingly slender. They remain, however, well within the style of the later Old Kingdom.47 According to the ratio used in other porticoes of the Old Kingdom,48 the distance between the columns should actually have been half their height, that is 5.25 m. This distance might have been reduced to 4.725 or even to 4.20 m because of the immense size and weight of the granite architraves (36 tons!). If a fifth column was actually found (see above) we would have\u2014for reasons of symmetry\u2014to place at least six columns forming a longitudinal hall divided by two rows of three columns into three aisles. Middle Kingdom activity in the northeastern Delta is further suggested by granite papyrus bundle columns, a granite architrave and other blocks of Senwosret III, and royal statuary of Amenemhat I, Senwosret I, Amenemhat II, Senwosret II and the Thirteenth Dynasty from Tanis.49 b) A hypothetical reconstruction of the old temple of Bubastis must include four palm and four papyrus bundle columns, in addition to the famous group of granite Hathor capitals, generally attributed to the Twelfth Dynasty. Naville differentiated a larger and a smaller group, while Habachi thought that they were variations of the same columns (height \u201clittle above 7 feet\u201d or 2.15 m according to Naville); from this measurement one may estimate that the columns were 6\u20138 m high. Hypothetically, one could reconstruct an Old Kingdom hypostyle hall (fig. 2, lower) consisting of four, 6.34 m high palm capital columns, enlarged in the earlier Twelfth Dynasty (Amenemhat I/ Senwosret I) by a second hall of four, 8.0 m high papyrus bundle columns. About the time of Senwosret III, the temple would have been enlarged by the addition of a hypostyle of sixteen Hathor columns. The existence of a Middle Kingdom monumental stone temple at Bubastis is further substantiated 47 The relation between lower diameter and total height is at Tanis 1/7.9. The columns of Sahura show 1/6.94, those of Unas 1/8.1. The columns of Herakleopolis have a ratio of 1/ 7.26. Only in the New Kingdom does the palm capital column become more compact, at Soleb 1/5.3, at Sesebi 1/3.7, and at Antaeopolis 1/5. 48 The relation between distance of the axis and total height: Sahura 1/1.86, Unas 1/2.27. Tanis might have been 1/2.4. 49 See PM 4, pp. 15\u201325.\n52\n03 ARNOLD Page 53 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:37 PM\nDieter Arnold, Hypostyle Halls of the Old and Middle Kingdom?\nby the discovery of relief blocks of Senwosret I and Senwosret III, the remains of a granite colossus of Amenemhat III, and other sculpture of the period.50 c) For the reconstruction of the hall of Amenemhat III at Crocodilopolis, at least sixteen columns are available, though without the outlines of the groundplan the reconstruction remains uncertain. One could suggest a hypostyle hall of at least four by four 7.20 m high papyrus bundle columns built in front of a sanctuary of the Old or early Middle Kingdom. The existence of a monumental stone temple of the Middle Kingdom is also confirmed by the discovery of wall blocks of Amenemhat III and sculptures of Amenemhat I and Amenemhat III.51 d) The Middle Kingdom temple of Herakleopolis, as indicated by Flinders Petrie, seems to have retained the same dimensions after the restoration by Ramesses II (22 x 42.5 m). Beneath the temple Flinders Petrie found burials of the Eleventh Dynasty, which suggest that the Old Kingdom temple must have stood somewhere else. One can assume that the Old Kingdom Temple was completely dismantled and rebuilt at the later site by Senwosret II, who may have used the palm capital columns in a front hall. Several blocks inscribed with the name of Senwosret III suggest that he completed this work of his predecessor. Numerous wall blocks and statuary of the Sixth Dynasty, of Senwosret II, Senwosret III, and Amenemhat III originated from this monumental stone temple.52 One final observation must be added. If we assume that hypostyle halls with 8 to 12 m high columns existed, one also has to consider that the walls of these halls must have been built of stone because brick walls would not have carried the weight of the stone architraves and roof slabs. These walls would certainly have been built of limestone; only doors and door sills and orthostates would have been of granite. Whereas granite columns had a better chance of surviving, limestone and granite wall blocks were much easier to dress down into smaller blocks or burn for lime. This would explain why so few decorated or inscribed wall blocks of the Old and Middle Kingdom have endured.53 To sum up: temple architecture of huge dimensions outside the residential royal funerary complexes has hitherto seemed inconceivable 50 Ibid.,\npp. 30\u201331. pp. 98\u201399 and Henri Gauthier, Le livre des rois d\u2019Egypte 1, p. 259. 52 See PM 4, pp. 118\u201319. 53 Uphill lists twelve at Tanis (T. 13\u201315, 17\u201319, 22\u201324) and five at Bubastis (B. 1\u20132, 5\u20137). Petrie excavated twenty at Ehnasya and the expeditions of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York about 100 at Lisht-North. 51 Ibid.,\n53\n03 ARNOLD Page 54 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:37 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nbefore the New Kingdom. The preceeding analysis combined with recent studies of Thinite temple architecture by Bruce Williams and David O\u2019Connor,54 urges an adjustment. Stone temples for the gods during the Old and Middle Kingdom were certainly less numerous than in later periods and many may have been of modest size. A few, however, could have attained monumental proportions, matching or even outshining the royal mortuary temples.\nb\n54\nB.

Kelly Simpson invited me to teach at Yale for a couple of weeks and when I was preparing a lecture on Egyptian portraiture, I had the opportunity to discuss this topic with Kelly and to profit from his great knowledge and infallible judgment. I thought it appropriate, therefore, to contribute a version of this lecture to his Festschrift, in affectionate memory of his hospitality and our many conversations on Egyptian art, literature and other subjects.1\n1. Sculptural and inscriptional self-thematization Portraiture is by far the most important and productive genre of Egyptian art, just as biography is the most ancient and productive genre of Egyptian literature. Both genres are self-thematizations2 of an individual subject, one in the medium of art, the other in the medium of language. To be sure, the Egyptian portraits are not self-portraits in our sense of the term, nor are the biographical inscriptions autobiographies in our sense. It is not the self of an artist or writer which is revealed by a statue or speaking in an inscription, but the self of the patron, who had the portrait sculptured or the inscription carved. What matters is the \u201cself\u201d that gives the order, not the one that executes it. I shall use the term \u201cselfthematization\u201d for every kind of sculpture, relief or inscription representing such an order-giving individual. By using the term portraiture in this sense of self-thematization, we are spared the thankless task of discussing whether there is any \u201creal\u201d portraiture or biography in ancient Egypt. In this essay, the focus is shifted from the sculptor to the model. Consequently, we can dispense with the anachronistic idea of \u201cartists\u201d 1I\nwish to thank Dr. Christine Lilyquist for the invitation to deliver a lecture on Egyptian portraiture at the MMA, New York, on Sept. 25, 1988, and my friend Dr. Dorothea Arnold for her kind assistance. The paper has profited greatly from discussions with W.K. Simpson, M. Lehner and J.P. Allen during my stay at Yale Sept./Oct. 1988. I am grateful to William Barrette and Peter Der Manuelian for providing photographs, and to Maria S. Rost for correcting my English. 2 Cf.\nJ. Assmann \u201cSepulkrale Selbstthematisierung im alten \u00c4gypten,\u201d in: A. Hahn and V. Kapp, eds., Selbstthematisierung und Selbstzeugnis: Bekenntnis und Gest\u00e4ndnis (Frankfurt, 1987), pp. 196\u2013222.\n04 ASSMANN Page 56 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:13 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nbeing \u201cattracted\u201d by, for example, \u201cfaces that express experience and sharp intelligence.\u201d3 We can deal rather with the order-giving, selfthematizing self, which wants to convey these qualities in its iconic self-thematization.4 No one will deny that self-thematization prevails in the artistic and inscriptional evidence of Ancient Egypt to an extraordinary degree and that both genres of self-thematization account for the singular character of Egyptian culture. For underlying almost every Egyptian inscription and every monument there is such an \u201corder-giving self.\u201d Since, as has rightly and repeatedly been stressed,5 Egyptian art is always functional and never decorative, it is this notion of self which seems to determine its functional contexts to the greatest extent. These are closely linked to Egyptian ideas about immortality, about self-eternalization and self-monumentalization. As everybody who has had some experience with Egyptian monuments is very well aware, there is a deep desire for eternity, for overcoming death and transience, at the root of almost everything Egyptian culture has bequeathed to us, which Paul Eluard called \u201cle dur d\u00e9sir de durer.\u201d In this essay I shall investigate how this desire for eternity is linked to conceptions of the self and how these conceptions are translated into forms of artistic expression. 2. Realism and idealization in portraiture Egyptian portraiture ranks among the most enigmatic and amazing challenges which history has in store for us. The enigma does not lie in the fact of its remoteness and strangeness, but quite to the contrary in its very closeness, its seeming familiarity and modernity. The bust of prince Ankh-haf, for example, which is from the Fourth Dynasty and thus removed by more than four and one-half thousand years, shows the face of modern man. This work, slightly restored and cast in bronze, and exhibited in the hall of any official building, could very well pass for a statesman or businessman of our time.6 The bust of queen Nefertiti from the Amarna Period (some twelve hundred years later) was, after its discovery, immediately welcomed into the world of Helena Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden, where it decorates the windows of innumerable beauty salons. But these busts of Ankh-haf and Nefertiti appeal to the 3 B.V.\nBothmer \u201cRevealing man\u2019s fate in man\u2019s face,\u201d ARTnews, 79 no.6 (New York, 1980), p. 124f. 4 For a similar approach, cf. L. Giuliani, Bildnis und Botschaft: Hermeneutische Untersuchungen zur Bildniskunst der r\u00f6mischen Republik (Frankfurt, 1987). Cf. also W.K. Simpson \u201cEgyptian Sculpture and Two-dimensional Representation as Propaganda,\u201d JEA 68 (1982), pp. 266\u201371, whose concept of \u201cpropaganda\u201d is akin to \u201cself thematization.\u201d 5\nCf., e.g., W.K.

Nefertiti seems to incarnate an ideal of beauty which we share, while with Ankh-haf just the opposite applies; there is a total absence of any idealization or type. Instead, there is an incredibly realistic rendering of individual traits in their almost expressionless, unemphatic state of relaxation. 6 Cf.\nthe experiment of D. Dunham, who had a cast of the bust \u201cfitted with modern clothing in a somewhat jocular effort to satisfy the writer\u2019s curiosity as to what an ancient Egyptian would look like living today in our own familiar world\u201d: \u201cAn Experiment with an Egyptian Portrait. Ankh-haf in Modern Dress,\u201d BMFA 41, (1943), p. 10. The cast was \u201ctinted in flesh tones and the eyes, eyebrows and hair were coloured in an approximation to lifelike values.\u201d The result, shown in a photograph, is most striking. Ankh-haf wears Mr. Dunham\u2019s clothing, hat, shirt, tie, and tweed jacket which fit him perfectly (D. Dunham being then, as he indicates, 6 feet tall and weighing 160 pounds) and looks absolutely plausible. What we have in mind is, of course, an experiment of a different kind. We do not propose to convert the bust into a modern mannequin which shows clothes, but into a modern portrait which shows a face.\n57\n04 ASSMANN Page 58 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:13 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nRealism and individualism are not commonly found at the beginning of a tradition of portraiture. In fact, two points are generally taken for granted. One is that realism and individualism always coincide, and the other is that this syndrome can only appear at the end of a very long evolutionary process. Thus at the beginning there is ordinarily the general, the abstract, the non-individual. Individualization evolves by differentiation, by a \u201cgradual sub-division of the general image.\u201d7 This evolution of individuality started with abstract geometric symbols like menhirs, developed into highly idealized figures like the Greek kouroi, and only at the very end of this process was the scene sufficiently prepared for the entrance of the individual. In Egypt, this evolutionary process was turned upside down. Here, tomb sculpture started with portraits of the utmost realism. 3. Magic Realism The typical tomb sculpture of the Fourth Dynasty is the so-called reserve head.8 Generally, the reserve heads render individual features, but in a much more summarizing or abstract way than does the bust of Ankh-haf. Most of these heads show a remarkably coarse treatment. The surface of the stone has in most cases not received the final polish. The plaster coating, which covers the Ankh-haf head and into which the details of the facial features are modelled, is missing in all of them. Some even seem unfinished, perhaps because the original plaster coating is now missing. The beauty of the more carefully worked examples, like the heads in figs. 3\u20136, lies in the summarizing treatment of features which nonetheless must be recognized as indvidual, for there is in general very little resemblance between them. They are not realizations of a common ideal or convention. The two examples shown in figs. 3\u20134 are from the same mastaba in Giza and represent a man and his wife who are clearly different from one another. Also, the two examples in Cairo (figs. 5\u20136)\u2014the left one a man, the right one a woman\u2014do not seem to reflect some generalized conception of a human face, but rather to render individual physiognomies. The hooked nose of Nefer (fig. 7) reappears on his relief representations. On the reserve head, it is the result of a rather coarse rewiring. Nefer was apparently not content with the first version and wanted his nose, which he may have regarded as a particularly distinctive feature, to be more emphatically shown on his 7\nErnst Buschor, Das Portr\u00e4t.

Such individual features seem to have been of great importance to the men and women who had themselves represented in this way. What is the nature of the concept of \u201cself\u201d and of the interest in \u201cself-thematization\u201d that possibly underlie these portrait heads? Obviously, the concept of \u201cself\u201d seems to have been very closely identified with the face and its individual appearance. What seems to me very significant in this context is the fact that the first attempts at mummification fall within the same period. There are even direct links between mummification and portraiture.9 Plaster masks like that shown in fig. 8 have been found in connection with rudimentarily mummified corpses. The \u201creserve heads\u201d seem to be functionally equivalent to these plaster 9\nThe early mummification technique is in fact a remodelling of the body by means of wrapping and resin, cf. D. Spanel, Through Ancient Eyes: Egyptian Portraiture, exhibition catalogue (Birmingham, Alabama, 1988), pp. 19, n. 44 and 35, n. 104. For the relationship between mummification and sculpture, cf. Smith, HESPOK, pp. 22\u201330 and Panofsky, Tomb Sculpture. Four Lectures on its Changing Aspects from Ancient Egypt to Bernini (New York, 1964), pp. 9\u201322.\n60\n04 ASSMANN Page 61 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:13 PM\nJan Assmann, Preservation and Presentation of Self in Ancient Egyptian Portraiture\nmasks. Even if they cannot be considered death masks in the strict sense, because they are not casts made from the face of the deceased,10 but modelled on the face over a thin layer of linen,11 it is highly probable that casts did exist as a transitory stage in the fabrication of the Ankhhaf bust and some of the more detailed reserve heads. Self-thematization, as seen in the reserve heads and mummy masks, must be interpreted as self-preservation. The portrait has no apparent communicative and commemorative meaning. It is not meant as a \u201csign\u201d but as a \u201cbody,\u201d to make a somewhat illegitimate use of the Platonic pun on soma (body) and sema (sign). \u201cBody\u201d and \u201csign,\u201d soma and sema, can also be regarded as the two foci on which the tomb as a \u201cbifocal\u201d structure is centered. This applies by definition to all tombs, not only to the Egyptian ones. Every tomb fulfils the double and even antagonistic function of hiding the body (the corpse) and of showing a sign of the deceased within the world of the living. In the Egyptian monumental tomb, both these aspects or foci are widely extended. The body focus is expanded into the techniques of mummification and the expenditures of funerary equipment. The sign focus is expanded into monumental architecture and lavish wall decoration. The question arises as to which focus statuary belongs, and the answer can\u2014with regard to the private sculpture of the Old Kingdom\u2014obviously point only to the \u201cbody\u201d focus. It is the body, and not the sign, which is extended by this type of tomb sculpture. Indeed, the total absence of the \u201csemiotic\u201d dimension seems to me of prime importance to the problem of realism. There is a gulf between what may be called \u201csomatic\u201d and \u201csemiotic\u201d realism, one being a technique, the other a language of art. The question is not whether or not an artist is able to render the individual traits of a given physiognomy, but whether or not he chooses to use the individual physiognomy to create a message of general import. In the frame of our investigation, which focuses not on the artist but on the owner patron, the question arises whether or not an individual chooses to convey information about his distinctive traits and qualities in his iconic self-thematization. In Egypt, at this early stage, we are clearly in the realm of \u201csomatic\u201d realism, realism not as a language but as a technique serving functions similar to those of mummification. In the Pyramid Texts, the deceased is occasionally asked \u201cto put on his body\u201d (wn\u221e.k \u2202t.k) the idea obviously being 10\nBut even those existed, cf. J.E. Quibell, Excavations at Saqqara (1907/8), SAE (Cairo, 1909), pl.55, pp. 20, 112\u201323; Smith, HESPOK, p. 27. 11 Cf. Smith, HESPOK, pp. 27\u201328.

There does not seem to be any functional difference between reserve heads, busts and entire statues. The three forms never occur together and are therefore in complementary distribution, which is indicative of functional equivalence. The statues also belong to the sphere of selfpreservation and not self-presentation; this means that they are hermetically blocked and protected against profanation much like the mummified corpse itself.13 But they are also meant in a way to participate in the mortuary cult. These dual and antagonistic functions of seclusion and participation were realized by a hidden chamber or \u201cserdab\u201d within the mastaba block, communicating with the cult chamber through one or more small slots, thus enabling the statue to smell the incense but to remain unseen and inaccessible.14 The statues reveal the same realism as do the reserve heads. Function and style are both identical. Only the treatment of the surface is different, and much of the even more striking realism of the statues (and of the Ankh-haf bust) is due to that treatment. Without the painting, the heads of Rahotep and Nofret,15 for example, look exactly like the reserve heads. Another famous case is provided by the extraordinary statue in Hildesheim of Prince Hemyunu (fig. 9),16 the architect of the Great Pyramid, where the realism extends to the bodily features. Here too, the stylistic resemblance to the reserve heads is complete. The statue of Prince Kai, the famous Louvre scribe, dates from the early Fifth Dynasty and comes not from Giza, but from a Saqqara mastaba (fig. 10).17 His head could not pass for a reserve head, even without the color. The difference affects the sub-structure and is especially noticeable in the expressive rendering of the mouth. The expression of concentrated attention must probably be attributed to the type of the scribe statue and\nFig. 9.

Generally, the realism now becomes more a matter of depth structure than of surface treatment and can be appreciated much better when the color is gone.19\nFig. 11. Head of Mycerinus from Giza, MFA 09.203; courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\n4. Royal Statuary: from \u201csomatic\u201d self-preservation to \u201csemiotic\u201d self-representation Turning to royal portraiture, we find pieces which seem close enough to the \u201csomatic\u201d or \u201cmagic\u201d realism of private portraiture like the heads in Boston of King Mycerinus (figs. 11\u201312).20 Although the facial type with its fleshy roundness is different and the insignia of kingship create a difference, the realism seems quite the same here as in the private sculpture. The piece most striking in its realism is perhaps the colossal statue in Boston of Mycerinus, where the much-too-small head, the protruding eyes, the painted moustache (now to be seen only on excavation photographs, cf. fig. 12), and the strangely shaped mouth with its thin upper and heavy lower lip are rendered with unmitigated frankness. But these examples appear to be exceptions that confirm a rule which points in quite a different direction. The individual features of King Mycerinus do not recur on his other sculptures, at least not with such unmitigated directness. The cheekbone, for example, the absence of which gives such a striking expression in conjunction with the protruding eyes on the colossus, is decidedly present on the triads or the group statue in Boston with queen Khamerernebty II, where the mouth, which has such a unique shape on the colossus, is also rendered in quite a conventional way (fig. 13). The face, circular on the colossus, is elongated in the group statue. What could these mitigations mean?21 The famous cycle of statues in Cairo of Chephren, which come from the valley temple of his pyramid in Giza,22 shows a shift in emphasis: it 18\nFig. 12.

Bothmer, \u201cOn Realism in Egyptian Funerary Sculpture of the Old Kingdom,\u201d Expedition 24 (1982), pp. 27\u201339, esp. p. 34f. where he confronts, as examples of \u201crealism in mature persons,\u201d Rahotep of Medum, the reserve head of Nefer, the bust of Ankh-haf, and the scribe statue of Kai. 19 Cf.

The unmitigated realism is characteristic of his \u201cSculptor B,\u201d who is essentially a realist, striving for exact portraiture, and the more generalized rendering of the face is characteristic of \u201cSculptor A,\u201d who is \u201cnot so much an idealist as the creator of the formula of a type of face which influenced all his work;\u201d cf.

M\u00fcller.\nis now not so much the recognizability of the bodily features that matters, but the expression, the \u201cradiance\u201d of the whole royal appearance (fig. 14). The insignia and symbols of kingship, the nemes headdress, the beard, the falcon, and the throne contribute greatly to this general expression. The material, the very hard diorite, polished to a shine of supernatural radiance, seems to be equally important. The emphasis is shifted towards expressiveness, and what is to be expressed pertains more to the divine institution of kingship than to the individual person of the king: dignity, majesty, divinity, superhuman power. With these statues we are obviously leaving the realm of mere somatic self-preservation and are entering the realm of \u201csemiotic\u201d self-representation. These statues \u201ccommunicate,\u201d conveying an evident message. These stylistic observations are in conformity with the functions and the architectural installation of the royal statues, which differ 22 For\na possible cultic context cf. D. Arnold, \u201cRituale und Pyramidentempel,\u201d MDAIK 33 (1977), pp. 1\u201314.\n64\n04 ASSMANN Page 65 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:13 PM\nJan Assmann, Preservation and Presentation of Self in Ancient Egyptian Portraiture\nwidely from private statuary. These statues were not installed in a hermetically closed serdab, but in the temple courtyard, thus exposed to daylight and human view. They belong to the general appearance of the architectural structure, thus functioning in the context of a superordinate \u201ctext.\u201d What we have called the shift from bodily self-preservation to semiotic self-representation corresponds to the shift from closed to open installation. The portrait is here not an extension of the body\u2014 soma\u2014but of the funerary monument\u2014sema, thus functioning within the sphere of the semiotic rather than in the sphere of the somatic. 5. Conventionalism and hieroglyphic generalization: private portraiture in the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties In private portraiture, however, there is a very substantial change to be observed in the course of the Fifth Dynasty. The realism prevailing in private statuary from the late Third until the early Fifth Dynasty gives way to conformity and conventionalism. The statues of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties look very much alike. The face is rendered in a very summary and generalized way, which is commonly considered \u201cidealized.\u201d23 According to the conventional wisdom, the faces and figures resemble one another so very closely because they all represent a common ideal of beauty.24 However, the following chapter will demonstrate that such a concept of \u201cidealization\u201d does not apply in this context. We are dealing with something else and should find a different term. In an attempt to characterize more closely what this something else might be, there are three points to be made, all of them very closely related. 1) \u201cIndustrialization:\u201d the production of non-royal statuary increases during the course of the Fifth Dynasty by some five to ten thousand percent. What was very high privilege, restricted to members of the royal family during the Fourth Dynasty, now becomes extended to the entire upper class. This increase in production in itself leads to routinization and standardization. Wherever there is industrialization, there is a tendency towards reproduction or serial production, copying the same models over and over again, resulting in Kunst vom Flie\u222bband (art from the assembly line) as the German Egyptologist D. Wildung aptly but somewhat unkindly called this tradition.25 Industrialized serial production places the emphasis on the reproducibility of the model, thus on its perfection. This leads to a Platonist view of the world, split-\n23 This\ninterpretation is too general to need bibliographical references. For a recent example, cf. Spanel, Through Ancient Eyes, who speaks in passing of idealization, the ideal being Maat, but also \u201cbeauty\u201d which seems to be quite the same (e.g., on p. 5: \u201ceternally beautiful\u201d and \u201cthe model of a sinless life\u201d). 24 Cf.\nH. Sourouzian, \u201cSch\u00f6nheitsideal,\u201d in L\u00c4 5 (1984), cols. 674\u201376. D. Wildung, in H. Altenm\u00fcller, and W. Hornbostel, eds., Das Menschenbild im Alten \u00c4gypten, exhibition catalogue (Hamburg, 1982), pp. 8\u201310. 25\n65\n04 ASSMANN Page 66 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:13 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nFig. 15.

Pair statue of Kaemheset and family; Egyptian Museum, Cairo.\nting reality into \u201ctypes,\u201d and \u201ctokens,\u201d models and copies, the general and the particular. 2) \u201cInscription:\u201d it is obvious and perhaps trivial to point out that virtually all Egyptian portrait sculpture bears an inscription giving the name and the titles of its owner, the only exception being the busts and reserve heads of the Fourth Dynasty. There, the great concern for individual facial features seems to ensure identification without an identifying inscription. But the statues, which do bear inscriptions, show the same physiognomic realism, so that the presence or absence of inscriptional identification does not seem to make any difference with regard to style. In the Fifth Dynasty, on the other hand, the inscription tends to be regarded as a sufficient means of individuation and thus makes physiognomic individuation dispensable. Image and inscription cooperate in conveying the same message, but \u201con different wavelengths: [as] two types of supporting communication,\u201d to quote W.K. Simpson. 3) \u201cHieroglyphicity:\u201d the third point has to do not with just the presence, but with the nature of hieroglyphic writing. The inscriptions which generally accompany Egyptian statues do not simply make resemblance dispensable as a means of identification. They also transform the image itself. They are not external to the image, belonging to a different medium as cuneiform or Greek\n66\n04 ASSMANN Page 67 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:13 PM\nJan Assmann, Preservation and Presentation of Self in Ancient Egyptian Portraiture\ncharacters would, but internal in the sense that they are images themselves, exactly as the image itself functions as a hieroglyph. There is no clear-cut line of demarcation between hieroglyphic writing and representational art.26 The images function in the context of hieroglyphic writing as \u201cdeterminatives.\u201d This intimate interrelation between art and writing has been amply and convincingly demonstrated by Henry G. Fischer in many of his writings.27\nAs images, hieroglyphs refer not only to language, as every script does, but also to things. They are understood to be the \u201cmodels\u201d of these things, whether natural or artificial. Thus, \u201cindustrialization\u201d and \u201chieroglyphicity\u201d point towards the same platonic view of reality. In the context of Egyptian thought, this platonic world view finds its clearest expression in the figure and the theology of the Memphite god Ptah, who is the creator of the world and at the same time the patron of artisans and craftsmen. He is believed to have created the world, not with his hands, but with his \u201cheart,\u201d that is, by planning, designing, and conceptualizing.28 He conceived the models or the \u201cgenerative grammar\u201d generating all the \u201cwell-formed\u201d elements that constitute reality. These may be compared to \u201cideas\u201d in the platonic sense, but not to \u201cideals.\u201d A hieroglyph is a generalized formula, referring to a norm. Ideals never refer to norms, but to goals which on earth are only approximately attainable.29 The term \u201cidealization\u201d is understood to refer not to \u201cideas,\u201d though, but to \u201cideals.\u201d This difference, which to me seems rather important, tends to be constantly blurred by our terminology. Thus I propose to use the term \u201cgeneralization\u201d for what we observe as a tendency in Old Kingdom private portraiture and to reserve the term \u201cidealization\u201d for artistic traditions, which are in fact oriented by ideals.\n26 This\nprinciple has been explained in Assmann, \u201cHierotaxis. Textkonstitution und Bildkomposition in der alt\u00e4gyptischen Kunst und Literatur,\u201d in J. Osing, and G. Dreyer, eds., Form und Mass: Beitr\u00e4ge zur Literatur, Sprache und Kunst (Wiesbaden, 1987), pp. 18\u201341. The concept of \u201chierotaxis\u201d which I attempt to introduce in that article is related to what here is called \u201chieroglyphicity\u201d and tries to explain certain characteristics of Egyptian art that are commonly (within the theory of \u201caspective\u201d) held to be unconscious cognitive preconditions as elements of a very consciously achieved \u201clanguage of art.\u201d 27 Cf. especially H.G. Fischer, L\u2019\u00e9criture et l\u2019art de l\u2019\u00e9gypte ancienne.

The Philosophy of Ancient Egyptian Creation Accounts, Yale Egyptological Studies 2 (New Haven, 1988). 29 The Kantian distinction between Normalidee and Vernunftidee is relevant here. The representation of the Normalidee is perfect, if only it does not contradict any condition of beauty. The Normalidee is the quintessence of correctness, not of beauty. Cf. H.G. Gadamer, Wahrheit und Methode (T\u00fcbingen, 1960), p. 44f.\n67\n04 ASSMANN Page 68 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:13 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\n6. Idealization: art and beauty in the late Eighteenth Dynasty A brief chapter on what I take to be such an \u201cidealizing\u201d style in Egyptian art may make this more clear. This brings us back to queen Nefertiti, whose statuary marks the very apex of this stylistic moment. The statues of Nefertiti may be regarded as love-poems in stone. Their most conspicuous features, the long neck, the slim waist, the broad hips and heavy thighs, recur in the love-poems of the age; they recur also in other statues and evidently pertain to the ideal of beauty of that time rather than to the individual appearance of Nefertiti.30 There is a very refined sensuousness and an almost erotic grace and radiance in the art of this period, an expression of \u201cluxe, calme et volupt\u00e9,\u201d which is totally absent from the sober, dry and clear-cut features from the Old Kingdom that are characteristic of Egyptian art in general. This artistic sensuousness, pointing to an ideal of tenderness, grace and beauty, starts in the time of Amenophis III and\u2014though at first violently opposed by the almost expressionist and caricaturistic outbursts of the revolutionary style\u2014dominates the whole of Amarna and post-Amarna art well into the reign of Haremhab. It is during this short period that Egyptian art comes closest to Greek art, as seen, for example, in the head of an unknown official in Cairo, shown in fig. 17. The common element of these two traditions is the tendency to idealize, which in Greek art is characteristic especially of the late archaic period. In the context of Egyptian art, it is to be regarded as a quite exceptional episode, a temporary emancipation from and the very opposite of the hieroglyphic formula. But is Amarna really \u201cidealized\u201d rather than \u201crealistic\u201d? How is one to account for the many plaster casts, masks and models which have been found in the workshop of the sculptor Thutmose?31 All this testifies to a keen interest in the accidental traits of a living face, in \u201cnature.\u201d This goes well with a realistic or \u201cnaturalistic\u201d art, but not with an \u201cidealized\u201d one. Even the royal heads seem close to the physical form. Nevertheless this is not inconsistent with what I understand by idealization. The sketches found in the house of the sculptor Thutmose prove beyond a doubt that in Amarna the living face in its individual form is the object of plastic representation, and not a super-individual\nFig. 17.

We must not forget, however, that these finds illustrate the starting point and intermediate stages, and not the final product of the artistic process. They show that this process starts from \u201cnature\u201d and not from preconceived ideas and point to the well known \u201cperceptual\u201d rather than \u201cconceptual\u201d character of Amarna art. It is this perceptual character that makes this artistic movement so exceptional in the context of Egyptian art, which is generally a conceptual art par excellence. But perception is exactly what \u201cbeauty\u201d means. Beauty is something to be perceived and not conceived. It is a sensual quality in that it addresses the senses. Thus, idealization\u2014understood as an ideal of beauty to be aimed for\u2014is a stylistic tendency which is well in keeping with a perceptually oriented art. But there is still another point to be made concerning beauty. Beauty, as an ideal of iconic self-representation, is not only to be distinguished from \u201chieroglyphic normality\u201d but also from the concept of \u201cperfection,\u201d of a spotless outward appearance that distinguishes the literate upper class, the \u201cliteratocracy,\u201d from the hard-working lower classes. In 1970, Kent Weeks clearly showed how, in wall decoration of private tombs, especially in the Old Kingdom, certain deviations from the normal type of physical appearance serve as indicators of social rank and professional occupation.32 They are d\u00e9formations professionelles. In order to stress the typical character of these features, Weeks coined the term \u201cpersonification\u201d as opposed to \u201cindividuation.\u201d In all these seemingly individualizing portrayals of bodily anomalies, we are dealing in fact with personification, because these features are indicative of class and thus of the social, not of the individual, self. Thus body hair, beards, stubble, baldness, paunchiness, etc., seem to be associated with people, \u201cwho were forced by their work to stay away from home for a while,\u201d i.e., herdsmen, fishermen, field hands and, less frequently, boatmen, bakers, and netters of birds. Incidentally, the same sense of humor with regard to the physical imperfections of the lower classes is displayed in the famous \u201cSatire of the trades,\u201d a Middle Kingdom classic which, apart from being a favorite text itself, has stimulated a great many imitations.33 Beauty, in the sense of spotless outward perfection, is\u2014and has always been\u2014a prerogative of the leisure class. The representations of craftsmen, peasants, shepherds, and so forth in the tombs of all periods do not belong to \u201cportraiture\u201d in the sense of 32\nKent Weeks, The Anatomical Knowledge of the Ancient Egyptians and the Representation of the Human Figure in Egyptian Art, Ph.D. dissertation, Yale University, 1970. 33 Cf. P. Seibert, Die Charakteristik. Untersuchungen zu einer alt\u00e4gyptischen Sprechsitte und ihren Auspr\u00e4gungen in Folklore und Literatur, \u00c4g. Abh. 17 (Wiesbaden, 1967).\n69\n04 ASSMANN Page 70 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:13 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nour definition, because they are no self-thematizations. Had these people been in a position to have themselves represented in a statue or stela or tomb wall of their own, they would no doubt have chosen different attire. This speculation is not altogether theoretical; there are plenty of stelae and even tombs of craftsmen and artisans preserved in Egypt, the best known being the tombs of Deir el Medinah. Everywhere, the owner appears in the attire and makeup of the literate official, the scribe with clean hands and white garments, who\u2014in the satirical texts mentioned above\u2014looks down with considerable disdain and derision on the working classes of which the tomb owner is himself a member. The opposite of these bodily imperfections is not beauty, however, but perfection. Beauty and perfection are of course closely related, but not synonymous. There is a difference, which might not be irrelevant in the context of this discussion. Perfection is the degr\u00e9 zero in the representation of the human figure. It is merely the absence of any distinguishing abnormalities like baldness, paunchiness, etc. Even beauty may appear as a deviation from the norm. This is quite frequently the case with, for example, the representations of female musicians and dancers in New Kingdom tombs. The bodily features of these girls deviate from the overslim female norm. In self-thematization, this alluring rendering of breasts, waist, hips, and thighs would be impossible. But it is exactly this characterization of beauty that becomes the norm in Amarna art.34 In representational art, bodily perfection may be just the absence of any distinguishing peculiarities, impressed upon the body by hard labor and/or extended absence from home. But in life, it is much more than just a degr\u00e9 zero: it is a state which is difficult to achieve and which signifies something. The maintenance of a perfect outward appearance must have been a very exacting task which only the members of the upper classes could fulfill, disposing of their time so as to meet the requirements which the extensive devices of Egyptian cosmetics imposed on a person, whether male or female. It is common in dealing with ancient Egyptian portraiture to complain of the uniformity of appearance and the absence of individuality, to the extent of denying these statues the character of portraiture altogether. It is highly probable, however, that this uniformity was a fact of life, and not only of art. Cosmetics as practised in ancient Egypt was an art in itself, applied to the body and giving it the uniformity of perfection. Epilation, hair dressing, the wearing of wigs, eye makeup, dress and other demanding operations collaborated in 34\nCf. also J.R. Harris, \u201cThe Cult of Feminine Beauty in Ancient Egypt,\u201d Apollo 77 (July, 1962), pp. 355\u201359.\n70\n04 ASSMANN Page 71 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:13 PM\nJan Assmann, Preservation and Presentation of Self in Ancient Egyptian Portraiture\ntransforming the individual appearance of a person into something super-individual and uniform to a degree where people closely resembled each other, and even the sexes may have been hard to distinguish. Cosmetics, to use Kent Weeks\u2019 term, is a device of \u201cpersonification.\u201d Many of the tendencies and characteristics typical of Egyptian art\u2014and especially of portraiture\u2014pertain to the sphere of what Erving Goffman called \u201cthe presentation of self in everyday life.\u201d In this sphere, personification, and not individuation, is the norm. Beauty is something more than perfection. It transcends the standard, however high, of physical spotlessness which the cosmetic devices of personification can attain. It is an enhancement of perfection in the direction of a specific ideal. It is also again a matter of emphasis: idealization emphasizes certain features, placing them in the foreground, whereas perfection is a state of perfect balance. While the general concept of perfection, apart from some changes of fashion, remains constant throughout the phases of Egyptian art and history, beauty as a form of sculptural self-thematization appears only during a short period. With these distinctions in mind, we are now in a position better to evaluate the achievement of late Old Kingdom portraiture. It has now become evident that the uniform character of private statuary from the latter parts of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties has nothing to do with an ideal of beauty that became generally de rigueur during those centuries. We have also seen that, besides the conformist and uniformist tendencies of industrialization and \u201chieroglyphization\u201d prevailing in art, there is a third tendency of equally uniformist influence, prevailing not in art, but in life, namely, cosmetics. This tendency cannot be dismissed in dealing with portraiture. The face we show to our neighbors even in everyday life is already a form of self-thematization, of personification, a \u201csocial mask.\u201d35 Beautiful princess Nofret may have painted her face every morning exactly as the painter did in painting her Meidum statue. 7. Expressive Realism: Middle Kingdom portraiture With the end of the Old Kingdom, tomb sculpture disappears. When it reappears some two hundred years later in the Middle Kingdom, it looks at first\u2014at least in the north\u2014very much as it did in the late Sixth Dynasty. This may be illustrated by comparing the Sixth Dynasty statue in Boston of Tjeteti36 with the Twelfth Dynasty statue in New York of Sesostrisankh (figs. 19\u201320).37 Towards the end of the Old Kingdom, 35\nCf. E.H. Gombrich, \u201cThe Mask and the Face,\u201d in E.H. Gombrich, J. Hochberg, and M.

This concentration of emphasis destroys the tradition of Old Kingdom sculpture. Due to the extreme traditionalism typical of the Lower Egyptian schools, the same traits reappear in the early Middle Kingdom. But a very different style developed in the south, one which soon prevailed all over Egypt: The statues which Sarenput II, nomarch of Elephantine, had set up in the sanctuary of Heqaib, a deified predecessor in the function of nomarch, are only a generation later than the statue of Sesostrisankh. One shows his father Khema (fig. 21), the other himself (fig. 22).38 In the strict sense of our definition, only Sarenput\u2019s own statues can be considered as \u201cself-thematization.\u201d The statue of his father is ordered by someone else (the son) and made from memory. This may account for the very remarkable difference between the two.39 The statue of Khema is very close to a \u201chieroglyphic\u201d representation in its very general and summarized features. The statue of Sarenput II is the complete opposite in its richness of detail, its realism, and its expression of power, wealth and dignity. Both are much closer to royal traditions of portraiture in the Old Kingdom than to private statuary. This is partly due to iconography,\u2014they wear the royal kilt\u2014partly to the material, dark and polished hard stone, and partly to style, the expression of dignity and power. In a sense, these characteristics apply to all Middle Kingdom portraiture. The sharp line of demarcation which in the Old Kingdom separates royal from private portraiture seems blurred in the Middle Kingdom. The use of polished hard stone such as diorite, granite, schist, and quartzite becomes the rule with private statuary. The most striking innovation is the creation of new types of private statuary, which in a most felicitous way combine the organic and the geometric elements of Egyptian sculpture: the coat statue and the block statue.40 These very fundamental stylistic changes are closely correlated to correspondent changes in function and architectural setting. With the end of the Old Kingdom, the serdab disappears. Private portraiture now emerges from the hermetically concealed sphere of the \u201cbody\u201d and enters the sphere of the \u201csign,\u201d the monument. It no longer serves as a device for preservation, but rather for presentation of self. Instead of 37 W.C.\nHayes, The Scepter of Egypt I (New York, 1953), p. 207, fig. 124. F.

From the Middle Kingdom onwards, the temple also becomes a setting for private statuary.41 The invention of the cube statue seems closely to correspond to this new function. These are new contents of self-thematization which are reflected in stylistic developments. Yet the most decisive factor accounting for these changes in the forms and contexts of sculptural self-thematization is, in my opinion, that during this period the very concept of \u201cself\u201d underwent its most fundamental transformation in the creation\u2014or the discovery\u2014of \u201cinner man,\u201d of the interior sphere of personality. This makes its appearance in the texts of the period in quite a new vocabulary with concepts like \u201ccharacter,\u201d \u201cvirtue,\u201d \u201cnature,\u201d \u201cknowledge,\u201d \u201cinsight,\u201d \u201csilence,\u201d \u201cself-control,\u201d etc., and above all, the \u201cheart\u201d as the seat of virtue and character.42 Since the inscriptional genre of self-thematization, the 41\nH. Kayser, Die Tempelstatuen \u00e4gyptischer Privatleute im Mittleren und Neuen Reich (Heidelberg, 1936); cf. W.K. Simpson, JEA 68 (1982), pp. 266\u2013271, esp. p. 267 for further references.\n73\n04 ASSMANN Page 74 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:13 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nbiography, changes in the Middle Kingdom almost beyond recognition, it would have been most paradoxical if the sculptural genre of selfthematization, the portraiture, had remained the same. Obviously, it did not. On the contrary, it is precisely this new notion of an \u201cinner personality\u201d which in my opinion best explains the evolution to be observed in Middle Kingdom portraiture. This may best be illustrated by some royal portraits of the period. The statue in Cairo of Sesostris II is contemporary with the statue of Sarenput II (fig. 22), nomarch of Elephantine, and shows precisely the same serene energy and richness of detailed and \u201crealistic\u201d characterization. But this characterization does not necessarily point in the direction of what we have called \u201cinner personality.\u201d There is nothing peculiarly psychological in this kind of realism. One generation later, however, with his son Sesostris III, an evolution begins towards psychological expressiveness, one which has always and rightly been regarded as the absolute apex of Egyptian portraiture. Perhaps the most striking feature of the portraits of Sesostris III (and about one hundred of them are attested) is the rendering of the eyes, which appear to be actually looking (figs. 23\u201324). In Egyptian sculpture generally, the eyes almost never show a specific expression. It would be quite inadequate to read into them someting like an \u201cempty gaze\u201d or \u201cstare towards eternity,\u201d for example. They are simply not looking or gazing or staring at all, but indeterminate. They are not indicative of any eye contact with an object or a person, let alone an implied spectator. An analogous and simpler case is provided by posture. As a general rule, Egyptian statuary never renders specific postures as they might be assumed in normal life. The way sculpted figures stand or sit or squat cannot be characterized as \u201crelaxed\u201d or \u201cstrained\u201d or \u201cerect,\u201d for example. This kind of specification is quite simply not intended in the framework of Egyptian art and must not be read into it. Instead of concrete specification, we get abstraction. Postures abstract from specific attitudes, eyes abstract from specific looks (e.g., glance, gaze).43 Precisely this rule was broken in the portraiture of Sesostris III. Here, a specific look was quite unmistakably intended, a look as it normally occurs in life when there is eye contact. These eyes do establish contact. \u201cJamais,\u201d writes J. Vandier, \u201csemble-t-il, un sculpteur \u00e9gyptien n\u2019a rendu les yeux et le regard d\u2019un homme avec autant de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de naturel.\u201d44 The 42 Cf.

Head of Sesostris III; Luxor J 34.\ndecisive features to achieve this fidelity to nature are the rendering of the eyelids, the modelling of the cheekbones and, perhaps most of all, the absence of any of the cosmetic treatment that was usually administered to the eyes and eyebrows. Again we are reminded of the fact that the suppression of individuality applies to life itself and not only to art. Similar remarks could be made concerning the mouth. Here, too, hieroglyphic abstraction of any specific expression is abandoned in favour of a very naturalistic rendering of that play of muscles which gives a mouth expression and attitude. Expression changes with genre. The head shown in fig. 23, found in Karnak and on exhibit in the Luxor Museum, belongs to a colossal statue. In keeping with these far larger-than-life dimensions, the face expresses strength, power, energy, resolve, and enterprise. Even more than with genre and dimension, expression changes and intensifies with time. Not only eyes and mouth, but in fact the whole physiognomy grows more and more expressive. These faces obviously carry a certain message, although one has to be very careful in deciphering it in order not to read too much into it. There are certain notions, though, that reappear in almost every description. This is how Janine Bourriau, in her catalogue of the Cambridge exhibition on the Middle Kingdom, describes and \u201creads\u201d the facial form: \u201cThese faces show a deepening expression of sorrow and disdain. We can study the physiognomy of these kings, assured that we are looking at individual men, not an idealized image of kingship. We can see the family resemblance and observe the burden of being pharaoh etching its way into their faces.\u201d45 This almost unanimous response46 to the portraiture of Sesostris III must be interpreted as a part of its Wirkungsgeschichte in the sense of H.G. Gadamer:47 it tells us something about the semantic potentialities of a 44 J.\nVandier, Manuel d\u2019arch\u00e9ologie \u00e9gyptienne III (Paris, 1958), p. 184. J. Bourriau, Pharaohs and Mortals. Egyptian Art in the Middle Kingdom (Cambridge, 1988), p. 37. 46 The only exception seems to be D. Wildung, Sesostris und Amenemhet. \u00c4gypten im Mittleren Reich (Munich, 1984), p. 203, who prefers to relate the portraits of Sesostris III not to wisdom literature, but to the cycle of hymns redacted in the name of that king and preserved on a papyrus from Kahun. He rejects accordingly all associations of \u201calleged tragedy and melancholy\u201d and reads in these faces only \u201cpower politics, resoluteness and untroubled self-assurance.\u201d But this polarity is artificial. No one sees Hamlet in Sesostris III. The expression of sorrow and care is not meant as a symptom of melancholy, but as a sign of political responsibility, cf. i.a., Simpson, JEA 68 (1982), p. 270, who links the \u201caging, concerned and caring features\u201d of the portraits with the literary image of the \u201cGood Shepherd.\u201d 47 H.G.

This evolution reaches its apex with the Metropolitan Museum fragment (fig. 24). Here, the power and strength, resolve and energy characteristic of the earlier portraits has turned into bitterness, disillusionment, sorrow and solitude. Again, we seem to be looking at the face of timeless man and experience the same feeling of affinity as we did with the face of prince Ankh-haf at the outset of this investigation. The difference, however, is crucial. It is the specific expressiveness of the one, and the unexpressive \u201cneutrality,\u201d the zero expression of the other, that makes all the difference. Both display realism. The early realism we had called a \u201cmagic realism,\u201d born from concern for the preservation of the bodily surface-structure. The later realism might be termed \u201cexpressive realism\u201d born from concern for the visualization of inward personality or depth structure. Expressiveness, with regard to the facial features of Sesostris III as they are displayed in the Louvre fragment, can only refer to inward qualities and attitudes, to an inner personality. It is customary to compare these heads to a well-known piece of literature, in fact one of the great classics in ancient Egypt. the \u201cInstructions of King Amenemhet I,\u201d where bitterness, disillusionment and solitude are communicated verbally: Trust not a brother, know not a friend, make no intimates, it is worthless. When you lie down, guard your heart yourself, for no man has adherents on the day of woe. I gave to the beggar, I raised the orphan, I gave success to the poor as to the wealthy; but he who ate my food raised opposition; he to whom I gave my trust used it to plot.48\nAs is generally assumed, King Amenemhet I fell victim to a harem conspiracy, but the extreme case of a murdered king cannot account for a general attitude which finds its expression not only on hundreds of royal portraits, but also, as will be shown below, on the faces of their contemporaries as well. The specific wisdom of Amenemhet, stressing distrust, is just one element in a general wave of pessimism and skepticism characteristic of the literature of this age. At the bottom of this pessimism, which appears to be the very hallmark of the Middle Kingdom, is the conviction that man is innately unreliable. This unreliability consists in what the Vedic tradition calls 48 Translation: M. Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature I (Berkeley, 1973), p. 136; cf. E. Blumenthal, \u201cDie Lehre des K\u00f6nigs Amenemhet\u201d (first part), Z\u00c4S 111 (1984), pp. 85\u2013107; (second part), Z\u00c4S 112 (1985), pp. 104\u201315.

For the greater number kills the lesser.\u201d49 Thomas Hobbes took this to be the natural state (status naturalis) of man: man as man\u2019s wolf (homo homini lupus) living in an incessant and indiscriminate war (bellum omnia contra omnes). As is well known, Hobbes exposes his pessimistic anthropology as a plea for strong and authoritarian government, laying the theoretical foundations for absolutism.50 There might be a general correlation of absolutism and pessimistic anthropology which also applies to the Middle Kingdom. The concept of kingship at this time, the image of the Good Shepherd, is based on the conviction that the wolfish nature of man requires a strong and resolute government in order to protect the weak and to establish and maintain justice. Expressive realism subsides into the reign of Amenemhet III, in whose portraits the rendering of the mouth is especially remarkable. Even more importantly, it extends to private sculpture, too. The statue shown in fig. 26 is from the sanctuary of Heqaib in Elephantine and was made in the reign of Sesostris III. The resemblance to the royal portrait (fig. 25) is so striking that Friedrich Junge went as far as to speak of a \u201cborrowed personality.\u201d51 This, however, seems rather paradoxical. We have become acquainted with the Egyptian ways of suppressing individuality, both in life and in art, applied to outward appearance. It is inner personality, however, that is usually identified with \u201cindividuality.\u201d Yet this is somewhat hasty; there are no compelling reasons why inner personality should not be as socially shaped and determined as outward appearance. On the contrary: virtues, values and axioms which shape an inner personality are usually group-specific; they are shared by all members of a class or community. An expressive realism, which strives at visually revealing and communicating inward personality, tends to uniformity in the same measure as this inner personality is socially shaped. Features expressive of inner qualities or attitudes like frowning, halfclosed eyelids, sunken eyes, lowered lips, etc., soon become fixed formulas or clich\u00e9s\u2014\u201cpathos formulas\u201d in the sense of Aby Warburg52\u2014in the language of sculptural self-thematization which remained in use into 49\nAdmonitions. I cannot quite understand how Miriam Lichtheim, Maat in Egyptian Autobiographies and Related Studies, OBO 120 (Fribourg, 1992), p. 46f., can be certain that \u201cthe thoroughly negative view that \u201cdie Gro\u00dfen fressen die Kleinen\u201d did not exist in ancient Egypt.\u201d 50 Cf. e.g., L.

What is perhaps more astonishing is that this sculptural language fell into complete disuse with the emergence of the New Kingdom. Given the notorious traditionalism of the Egyptian civilization, it is quite incredible that this tradition of artistic self-thematization should have been so completely lost and forgotten as it indeed must have been. For in the Eighteenth Dynasty, even the scribe statues of wise men look young and beautiful, just as in the late Middle Kingdom every one looked wise and sorrowful. In one of his well known Cairo statues, Amenophis, son of Hapu, wanted himself to be represented as a \u201csage;\u201d he, therefore, had to have recourse to a model of the late Twelfth Dynasty, feeling more ready to identify himself with this quotation from another epoch than with the language of contemporary art.53 The reuse 52\nCf. L. Giuliani, Bildnis und Botschaft: Hermeneutische Untersuchungen zur Bildniskunst der r\u00f6mischen Republik, who uses this term in his \u201chermeneutic reading\u201d of Roman portraiture, which comes very close to what is here understood by \u201cexpressive realism.\u201d\n78\n04 ASSMANN Page 79 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:13 PM\nJan Assmann, Preservation and Presentation of Self in Ancient Egyptian Portraiture\nof Middle Kingdom sculpture soon became the great fashion of the Ramesside kings. Nevertheless, its style could not be imitated,54 any more than in literature, where the Middle Kingdom classics were copied but not imitated. Both the verbal language and the language of art of the Middle Kingdom became dead languages. There was, however, a revival. In the Late Period, one thousand years after the end of the Middle Kingdom, its artistic language became revitalized. The formulas expressive of inner life, the modelling of eyes and mouth in particular, again became a living language, coinciding with a flourishing of biographical literature.55 The Late Period may therefore be regarded as the heyday of Egyptian verbal and sculptural self-thematization. 8. Individuation and Immortality We started with the observation that Egyptian art is in the highest degree \u201cself thematizing.\u201d This concern that the \u201cself\u201d be preserved and/or presented in inscriptional and sculptural forms determines not 53\nSylvia Schoske \u201cHistorisches Bewu\u00dftsein in der \u00e4gyptischen Kunst,\u201d MJbK 38 (1987), pp. 7\u201326, goes so far as to assume that Amenophis in fact usurped a statue of the late Middle Kingdom. This observation does not meet with universal approval, though, and the possibility that the statue is in fact a work of the Eighteenth Dynasty has to be seriously considered, cf. Edna R. Russmann, Egyptian Sculpture. Cairo and Luxor (Austin, 1989), pp. 106\u2013107 (cat. 51). In any event, whether by usurpation or by imitation, the statue testifies recourse to the late Middle Kingdom. Decisive is the fact that it is always this period that reappears in later art and literature when the ideal to be expressed is \u201cwisdom.\u201d\n54 Cf. Assmann, \u201cDie Entdeckung der Vergangenheit. Innovation und Restauration in der \u00e4gyptischen Literaturgeschichte,\u201d in H.U. Gumbrecht, and U. Link-Heer, eds., Epochenschwellen und Epochenbewu\u00dftsein im Diskurs der Literatur- und Sprachhistorie (Frankfurt, 1985), pp. 484\u201399. 55 Cf. E. Otto, Die biographischen Inschriften der \u00e4gyptischen Sp\u00e4tzeit (Leiden, 1954). Most remarkably, the image of the Good Shepherd, in connection with elements of \u201cnegative anthropology,\u201d returns in the Late Period, too. In an unpublished wisdom text in the Brooklyn Museum, the political philosophy of the Middle Kingdom reappears in the same way, as its style revives the plastic arts. This is what G. Posener and J. Sainte Fare Garnot meant in \u201cSur une sagesse \u00e9gyptienne de basse \u00e9poque (Papyrus Brooklyn No. 47.218.135),\u201d in Les sagesses du Proche Orient ancien, Bibl. des centres d\u2019\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es, colloque de Strasbourg 1962 (Paris, 1963), pp. 153\u201357, esp. p. 154, concerning the relevant passages on \u2018page C:\u2019 \u201cToutefois le th\u00e8me favori de l\u2019auteur est l\u2019apologie du chef.

The concepts of \u201crealism\u201d and \u201cindividualism\u201d are not anachronistic with regard to ancient Egypt, but are rather at the very center or artistic function and intention. Underlying these tendencies is the firm belief in a post-mortem existence, not as an anonymous shadow, but in complete preservation of personal identity as it has developed during the lifetime of an individual. This belief, which so strikingly contradicts the views held by neighboring civilizations (Mesopotamia, Israel, Greece) about such matters,56 makes all the difference and may be regarded as the basic Egyptian conviction. Yet this conviction is based upon two different ideas of equal longevity and binding force, which to our understanding seem rather contradictory. One envisions endurance upon earth in social memory, and the other an eternal life in another world after having passed the examination of posthumous judgment and the transfiguration into a \u201cluminous spirit\u201d (akh).57 Both ideas stress the individual. It is because of his individual achievement that a person may aspire to an enduring place in social memory, and it is his individual life for which he is held accountable in the examination of the \u201cPsychostasia.\u201d Neither before the one nor the other instance can he rely on collectivistic distinctions like noble descent, group membership, etc. Only personal achievements count. Consequently, Egyptian anthropology is determined by a variety of concepts and ideas that belong to its views concerning death and an afterlife, such as ka, ba, akh, etc. We cannot go into these details here, but in conclusion and by way of illustrating the enormous importance of individuating principles in thought about man, his nature and his destiny, I shall briefly enumerate some concepts which are related to birth and death: 1) To shape the individual form and character on a potter\u2019s wheel is the function of the god Khnumu. According to Egyptian belief, every man has his own Khnumu as a symbol of his genetic individuality.58 2) The aspect of an individual\u2019s fate, the sum of favorable and calamitous events which determine his personal career, is represented by the goddess Meskhenet, the personification of the birth stool or brick, who appears as \u201chis (individual) Meskhenet\u201d at the birth of a person and prophecies his career.59 56 S.G.F. Brandon, The Judgment of the Dead: An Historical and Comparative Study of the\nIdea of a Post-Mortem Judgment in the Major Religions (London, 1967), and J.Gw. Griffiths, The Divine Verdict (Leiden, 1991), offer a useful survey of these different beliefs concerning death and afterlife. 57 See the studies by Brandon and Griffiths cited in the note above. 58 Cf.

Their charge in this context is to represent the individual factors of life\u2014its particular chances and handicaps\u2014vis \u00e0 vis the super-individual norm of the goddess Maat (truth-justice-order). The central role in the judicial examination is played by the heart. which is weighed on the balance against an image of Maat. The heart mediates the spheres of individuation and socialization. Especially important in the context of portraiture is the role of the \u201cface\u201d (Egyptian \u00a2r) in Egyptian anthroplogy. The ba, the form in which the transfigured dead survives outside the body in another world, is represented as a bird with a human head. The body represents the celestial nature of this being, the head its personal identity as a human being with names and titles and, above all, with a past on earth during which its specific personality evolved. In a hymn to the creator god we even read: thou hast built all that exists with the labor of thy hands; it is thou who createst their shapes, every singular face of them being distinguished from its fellow.62\nOf the two focal points which determine and organize Egyptian mortuary beliefs, endurance in social memory and posthumous judgment, it is the concept of social memory to which portraiture is more closely related. Portraiture is visualized memory. Portraiture, as well as its inscriptional counterpart, biography, is meant to keep alive the remembrance of the individual appearance, achievement and character of the deceased and to bestow permanence to the singular and unmistakably individual final shape that s/he has developed during her/his time upon earth.\nb\n60 J.\nBroekhuis, De godin Renenwetet (Leiden, 1971).

Both internally and in historical terms, the texts pose problems of order of reading that have 2 been analyzed in particular by Ursula R\u00f6\u00dfler-K\u00f6hler. In this brief study I return to similar questions in honor of William Kelly Simpson, who has contributed so much to the study of Egyptian literature and history, and of the monuments whose owners integrated those two categories to proclaim their role in events. The inscriptions are divided quite rigidly down the vertical axis of the statue, except for the back pillar, which has a single text in three 1 Vatican\ncollections, 196; perhaps from Hadrian\u2019s villa at Tivoli.

Georges Posener (see n. 1) followed Giulio Farina in his presentation, lettering the sections on the statue\u2019s right in upper case 4 and on its left in lower case (see figs. 1\u20132). They began with the material framing the naos (A, 1\u20132) and on top of it (A, 3\u20136), continuing with the major panels beneath the arms (B, 7\u201315; b, 16\u201323). They then treated the columns on the naos support at the front (C, 24\u201327; c, 28\u201330) and the panels on its sides and on the body above the arms (D, 31\u201336; d, 37\u201342), concluding with the back pillar (E, 43\u201345) and the plinth (F, f, 46\u201348). It may not be possible to devise any single ordering and this could be inappropriate, since a work of art such as the statue may not impose any one sequence of viewing and reading, even if texts are necessarily more sequential than pictorial materials. It is, however, worth investigating whether the distribution of the texts has a thematic or iconographic significance, in addition to the sequence in which the inscriptions may best be read. While the distribution of the inscriptions on the statue will hardly have been deliberately ambiguous, its prime purpose was probably not to create a single consistent narrative. The longest narratives of Udjahorresne are contained in the two visually balancing inscriptions under the arms of the statue (B, 7\u201315; b, 16\u201323). These are of uneven textual size (38 and 26 metrical verses respectively), together giving a seemingly consecutive treatment of the protagonist\u2019s relations with Cambyses, as well as looking back to Amasis and Psammetichus III. The back pillar (E, 43\u201345), which has a narrative of the reign of Darius I, may perhaps be read continuous with 5 these. Nineteenth century scholars presented the side panels first, 6 whereas Farina, Posener, and later writers have started with the upper part of the naos surround. While this latter ordering is better in terms of 3 \u201cLa politica religiosa di Cambise in Egitto,\u201d Bilychnis 331, year 18, fasc. 1 (1929), pp. 449\u2013\n57. 4 This lettering also covers the naos, which is best described from the statue\u2019s point of view (contrary to the practice of Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature III, pp. 36\u201341). R\u00f6\u00dflerK\u00f6hler, Individuelle Haltungen zum \u00e4gyptischen K\u00f6nigtum der Sp\u00e4tzeit, p. 50 n. 11, states incorrectly that Posener reversed the main inscription panels (compare published photographs). This impression was probably given by the changes in orientation in descriptions of the naos and the statue: her usage of \u201cright\u201d and \u201cleft\u201d in her figs. 1\u20132 is the opposite of conventional statue description. 5 E.g., Heinrich Brugsch, Thesaurus Inscriptionum Aegyptiacarum IV (Leipzig, 1884), pp. 636\u201342, 691\u201397; Karl Piehl, Inscriptions hi\u00e9roglyphiques, 1st series (Stockholm and Leipzig, 1886), pls. 32\u201335, pp. 39\u201342; Marucchi (see note 3 above), pp. 81\u2013100. 6 E.g., Alan B.

Apart from the awkwardness of this selective movement around the statue, the resulting overall shape of the composition may not be satisfactory, because the formulaic phrases and general religious actions which are the presupposition of the whole are placed near the end. In comparison, unitary royal inscriptions and nonroyal biographies tend to begin with extensive formulaic materials and only then move to the narrative. It is therefore worth testing a placing of the formal material, which is at the front of the statue and closest to the naos and its statuette of Osiris, near the beginning. R\u00f6\u00dfler-K\u00f6hler orders the material according to two principal criteria. She distinguishes between Cambyses\u2019s orders, which are said to be executed by others after advice by Udjahorresne, and those of Darius, which are executed by Udjahorresne himself without such advice. On this basis she assigns the episodes of \u00a7 D, d to the reign of Darius I. R\u00f6\u00dfler-K\u00f6hler then groups the texts thematically according to the deities mentioned, demonstrating that Neith is principally named on the right (her \u201cleft,\u201d see n. 4) and Osiris on the left. Her assignment of D to Darius I additionally produces a visual distribution of the material, illustrated in her fig. 3, in which the parts set highest on the statue are related to his reign. I should like to propose another approach to the ordering. The passages covering the walls of the naos and continuing on the figure\u2019s torso above the arms (D, 31\u201336; d, 37\u201342) remain the center of discussion. Temporally they cannot be assigned with certainty, because they refer to the king as \u201cHis Person\u201d and not by name. R\u00f6\u00dfler-K\u00f6hler\u2019s assignment criterion of the way actions are described is fragile, because the Darius I sections are much shorter than those relating to Cambyses and the distinction could be based simply in the part Udjahorresne played in the two reigns and in a desire to give him a visible role. A parallel translation of the two crucial passages follows:\n87\n05 BAINES Page 88 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:28 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nRight (D, 31\u201336)\nLeft (d, 37\u201342)\nThe revered one before the gods of the Saite Nome, Chief Physician, Udjahorresne\nThe one revered before his city god, the Chief Physician, Udjahorresne\nsays: I established divine offerings for Neith the great, the mother of the god, on the order of His Person for the extent of time (m \u00a3wt \u2202t).\nsays: I was one revered of his father, favored of his mother, who was in the hearts of his siblings.\nI made monuments for Neith mistress of Sais consisting of every good thing, as an efficacious servant does for his lord.\nI established them the office of priest. I gave them good fields on the command of His Person, for the extent of time.\nI am a man who is good in his city. I saved its people in the great turmoil\nI made a good burial for the one who had no burial; I supported all their children and reestablished their houses.\nwhen it happened in the entire land \u2014the like had never happened in this land.\nI did everything beneficial for them, as a father does for his son,\nI protected the wretched from the mighty; I saved the fearful when his time (of fear) had come. I did everything beneficial for them at that time of acting for them.\nwhena the turmoil occurred in this district, among the very great turmoil which happened in the entire land.\na. This s(t) could be read as beginning a new sentence, but that would leave the last three verses of the section without any clear relation with what comes before.\nThe most striking feature of these passages is their mixing of traditional elements of ideal biography with references to what seems to be 7 a specific \u201cturmoil (n\u00dfn\u00a1 )\u201d through which the land had passed. The mixing of ideal biography and other elements has much older literary paral8 lels, for example in the Story of Sinuhe, but is unusual in biographies, which tend to separate formulaic sections from ones with individual content and to start with the formulaic. Since the texts must in any case have been carefully composed for their place of inscription on the statue, this mixing of genres could be related in part to the passages\u2019 placing in the highest, and in some respects most prominent, position on the statue. Udjahorresne would then cite his general concern with the state of people in his district as well as referring discreetly to the more embracing catastrophe which had happened in Egypt. From around two centuries later, the long biographical inscription of Petosiris in his tomb at Tuna al-Gabal has a similar formulation, referring to events during the time when the \u201cruler of foreign lands\u201d was the \u201cprotector (n\u2202t\u00a1)\u201d in 7 On\nthe interpretation of this word, see Lloyd (n. 5), pp. 176\u201377. Here, the presentation of Udjahorresne\u2019s journey back from Elam on the back pillar (E, 44) offers another striking parallel: \u201cThe foreigners carried me / from foreign land to foreign land,\u201d recalling Sinuhe\u2019s \u201cforeign land gave me to foreign land\u201d (B 28\u201329, 182\u2014the king\u2019s letter to Sinuhe). This coincidence need not mean that the author of Udjahorresne\u2019s inscriptions was familiar with Sinuhe, although that is conceivable. It is more likely that he drew upon established classical usage.\n8\n88\n05 BAINES Page 89 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:28 PM\nJohn Baines, On the Composition and Inscriptions of the Vatican Statue of Udjahorresne\nEgypt, and \u201cthe south was in turmoil (n\u00dfn\u00a1) / and the north in uproar 9 (? \u2014swh\u00a1).\u201d Udjahorresne\u2019s references to the episode of turmoil have been variously interpreted, but mostly identified with a rebellion or rebellions 10 early in the reign of Darius I. On such a reading, and if the text is taken to report events relatively soberly, such a rebellion would have had a severe effect throughout Egypt, something for which there does not 11 seem to be strong evidence. It would also follow that Udjahorresne made no extended or explicit reference to the Persian conquest itself, only to its aftermath. I suggest placing these passages near the beginning of the statue\u2019s sequence of texts. In comparison with Farina and Posener, this position gives an order A D C B E (F lies outside such a schema), but does not require that the whole be read in a consecutive sequence. The essential difficulty, already referred to, that the king of D is not mentioned by name, is presumably why scholars have placed this section near the end. But unless local knowledge bridged the gap, the ambiguity of reference of \u201cHis Person\u201d would have been just as great in antiquity as it is now; it might refer to any of three kings named elsewhere\u2014Psammetichus III, Cambyses, and Darius I (Amasis can be excluded because he died before the Persian conquest) and so cannot be used to decide the position of the situations described there. One reason for not naming the king might possibly be the small amount of space for writing available above the statue\u2019s arms, but since the whole composition could no doubt have been rearranged, such an approach is unsatisfactory. It is more cogent to see the reference as being unspecific because the matters referred to 12 were delicate. If the king referred to was Psammetichus III, to recall him here was inappropriate under Darius I, when the inscription was 13 In the analogous case of Petosiris, the presumably composed. 9 Also\ncited by Lloyd (see note 6 above): Gustave Lef\u00e8bvre, Le tombeau de P\u00e9tosiris II Les textes (Cairo, 1923), no. 81, ll. 28\u201330, p. 54; see, e.g., Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature III, p. 46. 10 So R\u00f6\u00dfler-K\u00f6hler, Individuelle Haltungen zum \u00e4gyptischen K\u00f6nigtum der Sp\u00e4tzeit.

Dependent on how it is interpreted, this inscription appears to be the only definite evidence from Egypt for the revolt. 11 See the comments of Jean Yoyotte, \u201cP\u00e9toubastis III,\u201d RdE 24 (1972), pp. 222\u201323. 12 Compare Anthony Leahy, \u201cThe Date of Louvre A.93,\u201d GM 70 (1984), pp. 50\u201351 (disputed by R\u00f6\u00dfler-K\u00f6hler, Individuelle Haltungen zum \u00e4gyptischen K\u00f6nigtum der Sp\u00e4tzeit, pp. 244\u201345). 13 Darius\nI is said to have looked back to Amasis for a precedent, at least in his recording of the laws of Egypt; see e.g. Edda Bresciani, \u201cThe Persian Occupation of Egypt,\u201d in Ilya Gershevitch, ed., The Cambridge History of Iran II The Median and Achaemenid Periods (Cambridge etc., 1985), pp. 505\u2013508.\n89\n05 BAINES Page 90 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:28 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nvagueness of the reference to a foreign ruler has meant that it has remained uncertain how his tomb should be dated. It is economical to heed this parallel and to interpret the passage as a description of the Persian invasion, deliberately kept vague in part because that was the peri14 od during which Udjahorresne switched his allegiance. Nonetheless, it cannot be finally established in historical terms, or in terms of the statue\u2019s texts, whether the episode referred to here was the Persian conquest or a revolt early in the reign of Darius; the reference could also be generic rather than specific. In thematic terms, an early placing of these passages sites the evocation of the most fundamental theme of disorder and the response to it in the most prominent position while tying it to the core statements of a traditional biography. The inscriptions above and below the naos tend to confirm the significance of this central area. The naos front (A, a) has offering formulas, while its vertical support (C, c) has a record of Cambyses\u2019s visit to the temple of Neith in Sais and the consequent ritual 15 actions and endowments. The naos roof (A, 3\u20136 ) has a short prayer to Osiris. Finally, the plinth texts (F, f, 46\u201348), which presuppose the rest of the composition, summarize Udjahorresne\u2019s achievements under \u201cevery 16 lord of his\u201d and appeal to the living, asking that they should preserve his reputation both with the gods and on earth, on account of all the good he did. This reading implies a double composition. The \u201ccore\u201d consists of the material at the front and near the naos, including both the statuette of the god and the identification of Udjahorresne and the main statue itself. Both treatment and subject matter are more schematic in the core than in the other sections, which may then be seen as extended and relatively \u201csecular\u201d elaborations of the given themes. Apart from the parallels such a distinction offers with the organization of long biographies, it is also comparable to the distinction between the decoration in stela lunettes, which include pictorial material, and extended texts beneath. A lunette is brief, tightly constructed, and visually ordered, while a running text is discursive and of variable length. Like modern scholars, such Egyptians as had access to the stature might have been drawn most to the longer narratives.\n14 This is also the interpretation of Lloyd (see note 6 above), pp. 176\u201378, who follows Posener\u2019s ordering but does not comment on the resultant oddity of the reference to the conquest near the end of the inscriptions. 15 Excellent photograph: Tulli (see note 1 above), p. 236 fig. 19. 16 nb\u2260f nb, a rare phrase, but compare nswt nb in cols. 29 and 30.\n90\n05 BAINES Page 91 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:28 PM\nJohn Baines, On the Composition and Inscriptions of the Vatican Statue of Udjahorresne\nThe distribution of the core texts is also analogous with the cosmological implications of temple and stela decoration. The artfully worded prayer on the naos top (A, 3\u20136) is the most intimate and sacred material on the statue, drawing Udjahorresne visually and thematically close to his god. The wording makes this clear: O Osiris, lord of everlasting, / the Chief Physician Udjahorresne has placed / his hands around you in protection. // May your ka command that everything good be done for him, / inasmuch as he has made protection around you for ever.\nAs in temple reliefs, a direct address is placed in the most remote loca17 tion. This treatment contrasts with the thematically similar plinth inscriptions, which are addressed to visitors and not to the god. The rather conventional offering formula around the naos front is complemented on the sides by the description of turmoil, which occupies the same conceptual space as royal \u201chistorical\u201d action in this world, establishing the \u201corder\u201d which is incorporated in the dedication of the statuette of Osiris. In comparison, the inscriptions on the naos support (C, 24\u201327; c, 28\u201330), which describe the visit of Cambyses to Sais and his dedication and endowment of offerings there, give a material and ritual basis for the continued interaction between humanity and the gods embodied in the texts above. This low placing of dedication texts has general parallels in the organization of stelae and a specific temple analogy in the 18 great dedication text at Edfu. The texts on the naos support end with praise of Neith and a strong statement of Udjahorresne\u2019s role, couched in very classical language, which would be visually prominent for a viewer first looking at the statue. This material duplicates to some extent what is said in the first main biographical section (B, 12\u201315). Such repetition may be best understood not as the narration of different episodes in similar language but as summarizing and fuller accounts of essentially similar material. The inscriptions and composition of Udjahorresne\u2019s statue show a coherence and artistic balance that can be pursued both in literary 19 terms and through the distribution of the material on the object itself. Just as the texts at the front of the statue carry the greatest symbolic weight even though they have relatively little precise \u201chistorical\u201d content, their verbal parallels with literary texts are most striking\u2014 17\nCompare Erich Winter, Untersuchungen zu den \u00e4gyptischen Tempelreliefs der griechisch-r\u00f6mischen Zeit (D\u00d6AW 98, 1968), pp. 53\u201355. 18 Dimitri\nMeeks, Le grand texte des donations au temple d\u2019Edfou, BE 59 (Cairo, 1972).\n19 Thus, R\u00f6\u00dfler-K\u00f6hler (GM 85, p. 48) shows that all the main sections of the text end with\n\u2202t \u201cfor ever.\u201d This feature is compositionally significant, but it does not help to choose between orderings because it is compatible with several of them.\n91\n05 BAINES Page 92 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:28 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nalthough all the texts have strong literary qualities. These artistic characteristics, which underpin the religious and biographical significance of the object, should be given due weight in a reading. On this basis, the composition can be interpreted as referring to the Persian conquest in a way that has not hitherto been proposed, while a revolt under Darius may not be mentioned. For the actors, however, the chief interest of the front of the statue is likely to have been its presentation of general and cosmological concerns rather than particular historical events. Despite the large amount of historical information in the texts, the statue should be read first as a dedicatory piece in the temple of Neith in Sais, which is the major single subject of the narratives, and only thereafter in more general historical terms. As in other biographical sources, the statue\u2019s focus is on the individual, and it is organized for biographical information much less than such texts as the comparably significant inscription 20 of Ahmose son of Ebana. A very rare quality of the composition as a nonroyal monument is its semi-iconographic organization to imply that its owner embodied the essentially royal role of setting order in place of disorder.\nb\n20\nE.g., Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature II (Berkeley, 1976), pp. 12\u201315.

Berman\nI\nn choosing a subject wherewith to honor my former teacher, Kelly Simpson, I have been guided by his interest in all things Middle Kingdom and also his devotion to publishing little-known monuments in American collections. In 1901\u201302 and 1904, Lady William Cecil, eldest daughter of William Amhurst Tyssen-Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney, excavated thirty-two rock-cut tombs at Qubbet el-Hawa, opposite 1 Aswan. Family friend Howard Carter, then Chief Inspector of Antiquities for Upper Egypt, was periodically on hand to supervise the excava2 tions. Lady Cecil\u2019s share of the finds entered the Amherst collection at Didlington Hall, Norfolk. When the major part of this important collection was auctioned at Sotheby\u2019s, London, in 1921, Carter acted as agent 3 for the Cleveland Museum of Art. Among the dozen objects he acquired for the Museum was the upper part of a stele inscribed for a chief of police named Shemai, from Lady Cecil\u2019s second season at Qubbet el4 Hawa (figs. 1\u20132). The stele is in the form of a false door framed on three sides by a torus molding with transverse and diagonal lashings in raised relief and crowned by a curved cavetto cornice with parallel palm fronds. The panel is sunk within a door frame. Below was probably a lintel and one or 5 more pairs of jambs enclosing a central niche. The main scene, carved in raised relief, shows Shemai on the right, seated on a low-backed chair, facing left toward a pile of offerings.

It is curious that the deceased faces left. The main figure in two- and three-dimensional representations nearly always faces right except when architectural or other considerations dictate the reverse\u2014for example, on tomb walls, where the overriding consideration is for the 10 deceased to face the entrance. The leftward orientation of this figure might have been occasioned by its placement in relation to the burial or 11 even by external factors, such as the proximity of a shrine. Unfortunately, the circumstances of the find do not enable us to say what that was. Most of the Cecil Tombs, including no. 28, are now inaccessible, and we must rely on Lady Cecil\u2019s description of it in the excavation report (fortunately accompanied by a plan, which does not, however, show the position of the objects as found): It is simply a passage measuring about fifty feet long and four feet wide, and from four to six feet high. At the end of the passage are two very small tomb chambers. About thirty-six feet from the entrance and occupying nearly the whole width of the passage is a shaft about twenty feet deep, at the bottom of which is a third small tomb-chamber. In the passage were found pottery of various qualities and 12 shapes, and the remains of arrows with many beads nearly all in blue glaze.\nThe stele of Shemai was discovered at the bottom of the shaft. Also found there were portions of another stele (present location not known)\u2014also of limestone, but inscribed in paint only, with remains of\n9I\nthank Patricia S.

The tombs at Qubbet el-Hawa date mainly from the Old and Middle 15 Kingdoms. The objects that entered the Amherst collection, however, mostly come from intrusive burials of the late New Kingdom to Roman 16 periods. In the Amherst sale catalogue the stele of Shemai is dated to mid-Dynasty 18. The offering formula alone would suggest a date in the first half of Dynasty 12, according to the criteria established by 17 Bennet.

I should like to offer him, with the collaboration of many past and present members of the Department, a study of the Dolphin Vase, one of the most beautiful and most well known objects from the cemetery around Amenemhet I\u2019s pyramid (fig. 1).1 Since the vase was discovered in 1921 it has been much discussed in the literature,2 because it brings together dolphins, which are common in Minoan art, and a vessel of Syro-Palestinian type found in a private tomb in Egypt. The vase was dated by Kantor to the Thirteenth Dynasty and used to correlate the ceramics-based chronologies of the Middle Minoan III period in Crete and the Middle Bronze IIA\u2013B of the Levant with the Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt. The absolute date of the Twelfth Dynasty, upon which the date of the Thirteenth Dynasty depends, was once thought to be one of the most secure in Egyptian history. The recent debate,3 to a great extent initiated by Professor Simpson\u2019s entries in the Lexikon der \u00c4gyptologie on Sesostris II and Sesostris III,4 has changed this certainty irrevocably. 1\nAll of the following have contributed to the documentation and discussion which follows, although any errors remain my own: Susan Allen, James P. Allen, Dorothea Arnold, Felix Arnold, Peter Dorman, Barry Girsh, Anne Heywood, Christine Liliquist, William Schenck, Ray Slater, M.T. Wypyski. Inevitably and necessarily, the current project to publish the Lisht excavations is a team enterprise and I have benefited greatly from the range and depth of specialized knowledge now available in the Department. 2 H.J.

For these reasons the Dolphin Vase cannot be used to support uncritically synchronisms between Egypt, Palestine and Crete, as in the past. A full discussion of its nature and its context is long overdue, and only when these are available can the vase\u2019s relevance to a chronological debate be established.

Courtesy of the Department of Egyptian Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nDescription of the Dolphin Vase6 At first glance (figs. 1, 8), the Dolphin Vase stands apart from the classes of Egyptian pottery found during the Middle Kingdom, which are now well known.7 The vase8 measures 14.0 cm (preserved) height and 15.1 cm at maximum diameter on the shoulder. The vase originally had a flat ring-foot, suggested by jugs of otherwise similar shape from Syria/ Palestine9 and this is confirmed by the burnishing marks, which change from regular horizontal strokes to uneven oblique ones close to the base, (fig. 2). The Dolphin Vase was made in three stages on a wheel. It was subjected to X-ray examination but visual inspection was more successful in reconstructing the stages of manufacture. First the clay was pinched 6\nSee also Patrick E.

After the juglet was allowed to dry somewhat, more clay was perhaps added and the shoulder and neck formed on the wheel. The vessel was then allowed to dry to the leather-hard stage, the excess clay was shaved down and a ring base was modelled. Finally the folded-under rim and fillet at the base of the neck were finished using a tool, and a three-coil loop handle was added. A multiplicity of techniques were used in decorating the vessel: painting, burnishing, incising and filling.

The outlines and essential details of the dolphins and birds were then incised into the painted shapes. Large areas of the animals\u2019 bodies were filled with punctate patterns made with both a comb and a single point. After firing the incised and punctate lines were filled in with a paste of white calcium carbonate. There appears at first (figs. 3\u20134) to be no spatial relationship between the dolphins and the birds, but when the design is flattened out, it becomes clear that each dolphin is associated with three birds (male and female with young?), while the tenth bird, which is much smaller, fills the area below the handle. The birds have long necks and tails, erect plump bodies and well defined toes, one apparently projecting backwards: these features suggest a wading bird of the stork, crane or heron families, although a duck or goose remains most probable. The fabric, as examined at 10x magnification, is a hard, dense, extremely fine material with many fine mineral inclusions, sand and a little fine straw. It was fired in an oxidizing atmosphere to a reddish yellow (Munsell 5YR 6/6\u20138). There are no examples of a similar fabric in Egyptian pottery of the Middle Kingdom. Fabric, shape, technology and decoration all place the vase unequivocally within the ceramic traditions of Syria/Palestine rather than Egypt.11\n11 This\nis confirmed by the NAA results reported in the BASOR article, see note 6.\n105\n07 BOURRIAU Page 106 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:40 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nComparanda There are three vessels, two found in Egypt and one in Palestine, which can be compared with the Dolphin Vase. The vase also needs to be considered in relationship to Tell el-Yahudiyeh ware, which shares some, but not all of its techniques and motifs of decoration, and has a distribution which includes Syria/Palestine, Cyprus, Egypt, and Nubia in the MBII\u2013III periods.12 The first vessel is an undecorated juglet of comparable shape to the Dolphin vase but less than half its size (fig. 5, top right). It comes from a shaft tomb at Lisht, 907, close to 879.13 Inspection of the surface suggests strongly that the fabric is not Egyptian, but without examination of a fresh break, petrographic or elemental analysis, a closer identification than to Syria/Palestine is not possible. Tomb 907 contained at least five burials, to judge by the number of chambers, and the surviving objects and pottery suggest a late Thirteenth Dynasty date. But there is no chance of reconstructing, however incompletely, original burial groups since the physical relationship of objects with each other, as found, is not recorded. Among the finds was a scarab of Mernefer-Re, twentyseventh king of the Thirteenth Dynasty, following von Beckerath,14 and the last of that dynasty with monuments in both Upper and Lower Egypt. The second vessel, also found in Egypt, is from Abydos, E515 and is now in the Ashmolean Museum, E. 250216 (fig. 6). It is not a precise parallel for the Dolphin vase, but it clearly belongs to the same ceramic tradition. It is a jug, 17.0 cm (preserved) height and 13.0 cm at maximum diameter, with a long neck, an \u201cinner gutter lip,\u201d17 a double handle and a broad carinated body. The base is not preserved. It is carefully wheel thrown (3.0 mm width of vessel wall) in two parts, a join at the base of the neck is visible, and the surface has been equally skillfully burnished. There are traces of red (Munsell 2.5 YR 4/6) pigment perhaps suggestive of the motifs illustrated by Amiran.18 The fabric is very fine, hard and 12\nM.F.

The section is a uniform reddish brown (Munsell 5YR 5/3) indicating steady, well-controlled firing, and the surface, light reddish brown (Munsell 5YR 6/3). Abydos E5 is not a closed context and the cemetery map19 seems to show it as two adjoining shafts. The surviving objects, pottery (Garstang, El Arabah, pl. XXIX); fertility figure (pl. XVII); wand (pl. XIV) and unpublished ivory hairpins and stone fragments,20 all support a Thirteenth Dynasty date. The third vessel is from Tell Beit Mirsim and is unpublished.21 What remains is the complete shoulder of a juglet, broken at the base of the neck and with the scar left by a single handle. It is wheel thrown, the surface self-slipped and burnished. On the shoulder is a band showing the heads and upper bodies (only one preserved) of birds(? ducks), the foremost of which is pecking at a lotus flower. The motif has been clumsily incised over burnished, purplish-black pigment. It seems likely that the technique is that of the Dolphin Vase in that the shapes were first 18 Ibid.,\nphotograph 106. op. cit., pl.

The style of incision is crude but the shapes of the birds\u2019 heads and necks closely resemble those on the Dolphin vase. The fabric of the juglet is fine and hard, with plentiful medium (0.25\u20130.50 mm) sand particles. The surface is pitted where fine mineral inclusions have burnt away. A scatter of fine red-brown and white (limestone?) particles is visible. The fabric is coarser and more sandy but otherwise appears similar to that of the Dolphin Vase. These comparisons, while not detracting from the unique character of the vase, serve to confirm, firstly, that it belongs to the ceramic traditions of Syria/Palestine rather than Egypt and secondly that comparable vessels, albeit small in number, were finding their way into Egyptian burials in Upper Egypt as well as into cemeteries close to the Residence. A striking increase in imported pottery from the Syria/Palestine area has been observed at Lisht itself during the Thirteenth Dynasty.22\n108\n07 BOURRIAU Page 109 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:40 PM\nJanine Bourriau, The Dolphin Vase from Lisht\nTell el-Yahudiyeh ware, which is very plentiful in the North Pyramid cemetery,23 is characterized by jugs and juglets decorated in incised and white filled designs on a black burnished surface. The black colour is produced by firing in a reducing atmosphere, not by the application of pigment as in the Dolphin Vase and this is an important difference. Another is the fact that the fabric of most of the Tell el-Yahudiyeh ware at Lisht is made from a fine Nile alluvial clay, and it is, in my own view, likely that, like most of the examples circulating in Egypt, it was made there,24 probably at Tell el-Dab\u2122a.25 At Kom Rabi\u2122a, Memphis, for example, in levels of comparable date, only one out of forty sherds was nonEgyptian. The structure of the design, which uses horizontal registers, and the motifs, geometric patterns rather than figures, also differentiate most Tell el-Yahudiyeh ware from the Dolphin Vase. However, two vessels from Egypt, from Tell el-Dab\u2122a26 and Dahshur,27 carry representations of dolphins, albeit much more crudely incised. It has been argued that the dolphins as depicted on the Lisht jug share mannerisms belonging to Minoan fresco depictions.28 Minoan frescoes have now been found at Tell el-Dab\u2122a (without dolphins) but in contexts considerably later than that of the Dolphin Vase. The context of the Dolphin Vase The dating of the shaft tomb 879 and its contents poses several problems. The nature of the evidence available from cemeteries like that around the North Pyramid has been well described29 and to this have to be added uncertainties arising from the interpretation of the excavator\u2019s records. We can rely on the fact that Mace, who recorded 879, omitted nothing from his list of objects from the tomb, but he provides no information on their deposition within chambers and shaft, so all we can do 22\nD.

The shaft tomb 879 lay on the south side of the Pyramid underneath the houses of the earliest settlement on the site, which respected the enclosure wall. The location of 879 was rediscovered by Felix Arnold in 199130 but the interpretation of the relationships between houses and shafts in this part of the site is not straightforward. The most significant finding for our purposes is the possibility that the original burials could have been contaminated by material, little later in date, from the houses. Objects from shaft tomb 879 Shaft tomb 879 contained at least one extremely rich burial, of the \u00a1myr \u2020\u00a2ntyw Db\u00a2.n\u2260\u00a1, the overseer of faience workers, Debeheni (fig. 7).31 The evidence for this lies in fragments of two coffins, one rectangular and one anthropoid. None of the wood survives but remains of the eye panel of a rectangular coffin (inlaid eyes and Egyptian blue inlays of brows and markings) exist, together with scraps of gold foil from inscriptions (in a script using mutilated hieroglyphs) and decoration from a rectangular and an anthropoid coffin of Debeheni. The inscriptions will be published in full in James P. Allen\u2019s forthcoming volume on the funerary texts from Lisht.32 Allen (personal communication) dates the coffins on the basis of texts and orthography33 to the reign of King Awibre Hor, whose burial, with coffins, was found by de Morgan at Dahshur.34 King Hor is fourteenth king of Dynasty 13.35 Sufficient decorated fragments of foil remain to suggest that a third anthropoid coffin or mask, without a name, may have existed. There is no reason to associate the Dolphin Vase with Debeheni\u2019s burial other than its unique character and quality but perhaps this is enough given the wealth of that burial. 30 Felix\nArnold, personal communication.

Facsimile of the name and title on the coffins in Lisht 879; courtesy James P. Allen.\nThe coffin provides us with a date around the middle of the Thirteenth Dynasty (following the position of King Hor suggested by von Beckerath);36 can any of the other objects in the shaft tomb be given a later date? Since we also have to consider whether there is evidence of any use of the tomb prior to the mid-Thirteenth Dynasty, are there any objects which must be dated earlier than that? Pottery The complete pottery group is shown in the excavation photographs in figs. 8\u20139. The group may be subdivided into the following functional groups: miniature pottery; tableware; and storage vessels. Among the tableware, the group of Tell el-Yahudiyeh ware juglets, the Dolphin Vase and the mysterious juglet (fig. 8), top, second from right, form a special class. Miniature pottery: fig. 9, top row, sixth and seventh The vessels are carelessly made of Nile B2 fabric.37 They are typical of funerary assemblages at Lisht. Senebtisi\u2019s burial, which was found intact,38 illustrates the complete set from a rich burial. Miniatures, 36 In\nceramic terms this is ceramic complex 6 rather than 7 at Dahshur.

Tableware: fig. 9, top row, first to third and last; middle row; bottom row, second and third vessels The cups, hemispherical and carinated, are probably of Nile B1;39 the globular \u201cyellow white\u201d (excavator\u2019s words) vessel, top row, third, is a small jar, broken at the neck, of Marl A3 and is probably therefore an import from Upper Egypt; the dishes, potstands and drop pots are Nile B2;40 and the jug fragment in the middle row, is Marl C.41 There are no exclusively Twelfth Dynasty types in this group. A mid-Thirteenth Dynasty date would suit all except the cups and the jug. The vessel index42 of the hemispherical cup, second in top row, is very difficult to calculate since, as the photograph clearly shows, the cup is strongly asymmetrical. Using the 1:10 drawing on the tomb card, an index of 140/ 142 can be calculated but this is too insecure a figure, and too close to 145, the boundary between early and advanced Dynasty 13 cups, to justify extending the group\u2019s date on this basis alone. The flat-bottomed cup appears to have the profile of a hemispherical cup with a a base cut flat almost accidentally in trimming off the excess clay.43 A very close match for it in profile curve and proportion of diameter to height among the hemispherical cups, is MMA 22.1.159144 which has a vessel index of 123, well into the advanced Thirteenth Dynasty. The jug fragment is likely to be intrusive from the house since the type occurs in settlements45 rather than in burials. Shaft tomb 896, where a complete jug was found, contained domestic pottery from the houses.46\n39 The\nfabric attributions are based on the excavator\u2019s descriptions and photographs interpreted by the writer who has studied comparable pottery from Lisht, Dahshur and Memphis, Riqqeh and Harageh. 40 The potstand, middle row, second, is described as \u201cpolished black.\u201d Another example from Lisht confirms that the potstand has been self-slipped and burnished before being fired in a reducing atmosphere. A similar technique was used for the Egyptian made Tell el-Yahudiyeh ware. 41 A complete vessel of this rare shape, also Marl C, was found in shaft tomb 896 and is now in Chicago, Oriental Institute Museum (MMA 22.1.1525). 42 Arnold, \u201cThe Pottery\u201d (see n. 7), pp. 135, 140. 43 The cup does not belong to the large class of flat-bottomed cups familiar from Tell elDab\u2122a.

The bulbous jar in Marl C has more to offer. A parallel for the rim but not the body shape is provided by a jar from Dahshur, ceramic complex 6,47 and an even closer match from the burial of Senebtisi (Chicago Oriental Museum, MMA 09.180.849). Senebetisi should now be placed early in the Thirteenth Dynasty following the most recent review of the evidence by the Arnolds,48 where it is stated that her shaft postdates a house \u201cprobably dating to the Thirteenth Dynasty.\u201d Tell el-Yahudiyeh ware: fig. 8 The tomb card describes, without illustrating, \u201cremains of 4 incised Kahun49 pots. Upper part of a handled vase in polished red ware.\u201d None of these vessels can now be identified with confidence among the pottery in the MMA or Chicago, so the photograph remains the only record of them. The most complete example, to which the other three may, despite their poor preservation, be related, can be assigned to Bietak\u2019s Piriform 1c type50 which occurs at Tell el-Dab\u2122a from strata F to E/2 and which, following Bietak, corresponds to the MBIIA/B transition and early MBIIB.51 The small vessel broken off below the rim in the top row, is certainly non-Egyptian. If the photograph is examined with a hand lens, the surface appears to be burnished and pock-marked with large irregular mineral inclusions.52 The shape recalls juglets from Palestine of MBIIA date53 of which one example is published from Dahshur.54 To sum up the pottery evidence: in my view, the pottery does not extend the date range in either direction beyond the dating provided by the coffin, i.e., the Thirteenth Dynasty up to the reign of Awibre Hor. We should allow a generation for the filling of the three chambers of the tomb shaft. This dating depends upon accepting that later pottery types,\n46\nIncluding a large thick-walled trough in Nile C and part of an incised bread tray in Marl C. 47 D.

Stone vessels There were fragments of at least eight stone vessels in the tomb, only three of which were drawn on the tomb card. None was photographed. Of the drawn vases, two were of alabaster and one of \u201cwhite limestone\u201d and they can be typed to Aston 135; Aston 157; and Aston 161.55 The date range of all these is given by Aston as Dynasty 12\u201313 and in the case of 135 and 161, also Second Intermediate Period. The rest of the stone vessels are described as \u201cpieces of two large globular vases in alabaster, pieces of two large kohl pots in alabaster, piece of a rim of a blue-marble [blue anhydrite] vase.\u201d Objects of Faience and Egyptian Blue None of these is illustrated or photographed. From the tomb cards: \u201cfragments of one or more glaze tiles; pieces of small dishes from a tile; pieces of two or three glaze vases; lid of glaze vase 3.7cm in diameter; piece of a lion(?) in blue paste [Egyptian blue]; pieces of glaze inlay.\u201d Faience models of food and offerings were common at Lisht56 as were small apotropaic figures of lions. I have argued elsewhere that such grave goods begin to appear in burials there from the late Twelfth Dynasty onwards.57 Beads These are now located in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They can be typed to the corpus of beads made up by Brunton for the late Middle Kingdom cemetery at Harageh,58 but it is noteworthy that among them were beads from a flail such as that reconstructed from the tomb of Senebtisi.59 This is yet another indication of the status of the burials in shaft tomb 879. It is necessary to sum up the evidence which a study of the context of the Dolphin Vase provides, and to begin with dating. The jug does not come from a closed group and we cannot, regrettably, say that it was part of the burial equipment of Debeheni, but we can say that all the objects (with the exception of the pottery discussed above) in the shaft tomb are 55\nB.G.

Given the current chronological debates, I am reluctant to suggest absolute dates for Hor but von Beckerath places him around 1760 b.c. The context provides much more than a date, +/\u2013 20 years. It provides a setting for the vase which includes a rich, high status burial and a group of pottery which contains one other actual import and 4 vessels of Tell el-Yahudiyeh ware. The Dolphin Vase remains unique but it must be seen as contributing to the sudden increase in Canaanite pottery which is visible in the first half of the Thirteenth Dynasty60 at Lisht. The contemporary expansion of Tell el-Dab\u2122a as an entry point for Canaanite goods and people offers a ready explanation. One final point concerns the burial of Debeheni. It may seem surprising that such a rich burial should be provided for an \u201coverseer of faience-workers.\u201d His own and many other late Middle Kingdom burials at Lisht attest to the number and importance, in ritual terms, of faience objects. There are apotropaic figures of dwarves, lions, and hippos, fertility figurines, miniature vessels, model food offerings, cosmetic jars, inlays for coffins and a whole corpus of beads. Preparing such funerary assemblages must have been a major activity61 and provided for the official in charge of the workshops an opportunity to ensure, like the workmen at Deir el-Medineh, that his own burial was as well equipped as any.\nb\n60 See\nn. 22. is evidence of faience working close to shaft 879, but its date is not certain.\n61 There\n116\n08 BROVARSKI Page 117 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:42 PM\nAn Inventory List from \u201cCovington\u2019s Tomb\u201d and Nomenclature for Furniture in the Old Kingdom\nEdward Brovarski\nS\neventy-five years ago Battiscombe Gunn commented on the inadequacy of our lexical knowledge of ancient Egyptian.1 More recently Janssen, in his masterly study of the economy at the Ramesside village of Deir el-Medineh, remarks that \u201clexicographical studies and special vocabularies are among the most urgent needs for the 2 progress of egyptology.\u201d Although the last few decades have witnessed the appearance of a number of monographs and works of broader scope 3 that have extended considerably our lexical knowledge, a great deal 4 remains to be done. 1 Battiscombe 2 Jac.\nGunn, \u201cThe Egyptian Word for \u2018short\u2019,\u201d RecTrav 39 (1920), p. 101.\nJ.

Inasmuch as he has also published one of the offering lists that form the focus of the current article in a 6 volume of the Giza Mastaba series initiated by him, I hope he will find the present study of interest. It is dedicated to him with heartfelt appreciation for more than twenty years of friendship, inspiration, and 7 encouragement. In the files of the Department of Ancient Egyptian, Nubian, and Near Eastern Art in Boston is a drawing in pencil on aging brown paper 8 of an inventory list of offerings (fig. 1). Someone has written in pencil on the lower corner of the sheet \u201cCovington\u2019s Tomb.\u201d William Stevenson Smith refers to the penciled note and discusses the offering list in 9 his study of Old Kingdom sculpture and painting. We quote him at length: This [the note] would seem to refer to the large panelled brick mastaba excavated by Dow Covington and Mr. Quibell on a high point in the ridge southeast of the Third Pyramid. This tomb was probably of the reign of Khasekhemuwy, but Covington also uncovered a few other pits and even a stone mastaba which is certainly as late as Dyn. IV, if not later. No one has any recollection, apparently, of the finding of a painted wall in any of these tombs, and it is uncertain whether it came from a chapel or a burial-chamber. Nevertheless the possibility that it may have come from the great panelled mastaba is further strengthened by inner evidence in the list itself. It is in the form of an early compartment list containing garments (including an unusual one called wn\u00df determined by a wolf and apparently implying that the garment was made of wolf skin), furniture, granaries, food, and drink. This type of compartment list is very rare after the reign of Cheops, and is characteristic of the transition period Dyn. III\u2013IV. Its most elaborate form is exemplified by the whole east wall of the corridor of Hesi-ra. Therefore it would form a suitable part of the decoration of a mastaba of the end of Dyn. II. Another early detail is that the thousand sign is painted yellow instead of the green which became more common later for all plant forms, basket work, &c., which were often yellow in early paintings. 5 William\nKelly Simpson, Papyrus Reisner I\u2013IV, 4 vols.

The rock ridge runs south for half a mile and, again as noted by Petrie, is riddled with tombs, especially at its southern end.

Covington and Quibell opened and traced round the mastaba, 12 and the former\u2019s 1905 report is illustrated with plans and a section. Petrie investigated the great mastaba, which was designated \u201cMastaba T\u201d by him, in 1906\u20137, discovering hundreds of fragments of stone vessels in its subterranean chambers, stone balls (or marbles) for a 13 game, a beautifully polished chert object, and model tools of copper. Although no royal name was recovered, Petrie thought that the general arrangement and position of the chambers beneath the mastaba were of the same basic type as the Third Dynasty mastabas uncovered by 14 Garstang at Beit Khallaf. He also noted that the mastaba had the same type of all-round panelling as did the mastabas of early Dyn. 1, there being fourteen bays and fifteen projections in the length and seven bays 15 and eight projections in the width. On the east side of Mastaba T, Petrie also cleared around a \u201clarge stone platform,\u201d of which the basement of the walls of the superstruc16 ture remained. A pit in the middle was cleared but led to nothing. Seeing Covington\u2019s Tomb/Giza Mastaba T as the last example of a palace-facade mastaba with elaborate panelling on all four sides, Reisner dated it to the reign of Khasekhemui\u2014that is, to the beginning of the 17 archaeological group characteristic of Dyn. 3. Henri Frankfort noted the unsuitability of all-round niching in the palace-facade mastabas of Dyns. 1\u20132 to the requirements of the offering cults, in that the arrangement afforded no real focus for the funerary cer18 emonies. The offerings were presumably deposited at one of the great 19 doors of the panelling immediately opposite the body. Succeeding generations of Egyptians sporadically distinguished the second niche from 11 Carl Richard Lepsius, Denkmaeler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien, 12 vols.

Such a chapel would indeed be the logical place for a painted offering list, protected from the weather as it would be, but \u201cCovington\u2019s Tomb\u201d lacks any such arrangement. Cognizant of this difficulty, Smith says: \u201cit is uncertain whether it came from a chapel or a burial-chamber.\u201d Since the earliest examples of the practice of decorating the walls of the burial chamber date to a much later period, namely to the end of the Fifth Dynasty, such a location can 21 probably be safely excluded from consideration. Smith observed that the type of inventory list represented in the Boston drawing is characteristic of the transition period of Dyn. 3\u20134, but 22 is very rare after the reign of Cheops. He therefore felt that the list would form a suitable part of the decoration of a mastaba of the end of Dyn. 2. In support of this early date, he further observed that the thousand sign is painted yellow instead of the green which became more common later for all plant forms, basketwork, etc., which were often yellow in early paintings. Unfortunately, Smith provided no documentation for the last assertion, nor am I able to substantiate it with reference to his appendix on the coloring of Old Kingdom hieroglyphs, which incorporates evidence from the tombs of Khabausokar, Hathor-nefer-hetep, Nefermaat, Atet, 23 and Rahotep. According to Murray, the thousand sign in the niche of 24 Hathor-nefer-hetep is green, as are those in Rahotep and Wepemnofret, although the sign in the slab-stele of Nefert-iabet has a yellow leaf and 25 a red base and stem. In the only archaic niche-stone with well-preserved paint to which I have access, that of Imet from Saqqara, the leaf 26 is yellow, the stem red, and the rhizome black with green roots.\n19 George A.

First, the list uses a later form of the determinative for mantles or mantle-like garments. In the early lists\u2014Kha-bau-sokar (3), Hathornefer-hetep (4), Irensen (7), Metjen (8), and Rahotep (9)\u2014and in the picture list on the eastern wall of the painted corridor of Hesyre, the determinative is , , , or the like. In the later lists from G 4260 (12) and anon. (13), those of Izi (14) and Setju (17), and the list preserved in 27 Boston, the mantles are determined by . Second, the term \u00a3\u2020t \u201cbed\u201d (a) in the list from \u201cCovington\u2019s Tomb\u201d otherwise first appears in the furniture list from anon. (13) from the 28 reign of Shepseskaf. Earlier the word for bed was st(-n-)\u221et (g). Moreover, as a rule in the Fourth Dynasty, the grain lists consist of 29 \u00dfm\u2122w, m\u00a2w, bdt, zwt, and b\u00df\u00a3. Dates (bnr) and the so-called \u201cearth 30 almonds\u201d (w\u2122\u00a2) are also common, and likewise appear in the list from 31 \u201cCovington\u2019s Tomb\u201d along with an unknown grain or fruit, t\u00dfw(?). In addition, in the list from \u201cCovington\u2019s Tomb,\u201d the thousand-sign has two distinct forms. While the leaf is usually turned forward, in two instances it turns upward. In our corpus, the earliest instance of the sign with leaf turned forward occurs in the slab-stele of Seshat-sekhentiu (11) from the reign of Khufu. Both versions of the sign appear in the other 32 slab-steles. The upright leaf reappeared sporadically in the course of 33 the Old Kingdom, but from then on the forward facing leaf was usual. Finally, the last entry in the Covington Tomb list is \u00a1\u221et nb(t) bnrt rnpwt \u00a2nkw(t) nbt, \u201ceverything sweet, vegetables, and all donations.\u201d While this entry occurs in none of the early inventory lists, i\u221et nbt bnrt is a commonplace in the great ritual offering list of the Old Kingdom 26\nW. Stevenson Smith, The Art and Architecture of Ancient Egypt (Baltimore, 1958), pl. 13. There exists in Boston an aquarelle made by Joseph Lindon Smith in 1938\u201339, when the stela was on deposit in \u201cEmery\u2019s magazine\u201d at Saqqara. 27 In the panel of Nedji (6), m\u00a3st is determined by an earlier form of the determinative and b\u00a3 \u00cdm\u2122w with the later. 28 The letters in parentheses refer to the lettering of the items of furniture in the discussion below, pp. 130ff. 29 Winfried Barta, Die alt\u00e4gyptische Opferliste (Berlin, 1963), p. 45. 30 The tubers of Cyperus esculentus L.; see Elmar Edel, Die Felsengr\u00e4ber der Qubbet el Hawa bei Aswan II/1/2 (Wiesbaden, 1970), p. 22 [7]. 31 Cf.

Slightly earlier \u00a1\u221et nbt bnrt rnpwt nbt \u00a2nkwt appears on the south wall of the chapel of Khufukhaf I and on 35 the sarcophagus of Minkhaf, both sons of Khufu. If, as internal evidence seems to indicate, the copy of the list in Boston is at least as late as the Fourth Dynasty, it obviously could not have come from the structure known as \u201cCovington\u2019s Tomb.\u201d What then are we to make of the label on the drawing? Smith notes that Dow Covington also uncovered a few other pits and a stone mastaba which certainly dates to Dyn. 4 or later. \u201cNo one had any recollection of the finding of a painted wall in any of these tombs,\u201d wrote Smith, yet it is not impossible that the original offering list whose copy is now preserved in Boston came from the stone mastaba. Covington places this nearly denuded structure just 11 meters to the east of the great mastaba that bears his name, describing it as a \u201clarge bluish-grey stone mastaba 36 (about 28 x 12 metres) excavated by Mariette,\u201d and again as \u201ca large 37 mastaba built of immense blocks of oyster-filled limestone.\u201d This mastaba is presumably identical with the \u201clarge stone platform\u201d on the east side of \u201cCovington\u2019s Tomb/Mastaba T\u201d excavated by Petrie. If the fragmentary compartment list does not derive from the stone mastaba, it may have been found in or near one of the other four mastabas referred to by Covington, about which he unfortunately provides 38 no details. In his exhaustive study of offering lists, Prof. Barta distinguished two types, the ritual offering list (\u201cRitualopferliste\u201d) and the inventory 39 offering list (\u201cInventaropferliste\u201d). Whereas the former preserves the ritual of the funerary offering cult, the latter enumerates the household effects and other equipment which might be of utility in the next world. Barta\u2019s inventory offering list corresponds to Reisner\u2019s \u201cold compart40 ment list.\u201d As Smith notes, the so-called \u201ccupboard list\u201d covering the whole east wall of the corridor in the tomb of Hesyre represents the most extensive exemplar of the inventory offering lists but, as fate would have it, the captions inscribed at the top of the wall have largely 34 Hermann Junker, G\u00eeza, 12 vols.

More complete offering lists include food and drink, linen, unguents and perfumes, mantles, metal utensils, stone vessels, house42 hold furnishings, and on occasion, woodworking tools (14, 23). Rahotep (9) adds to these board games, a ewer and basin for hand-washing, a beaded collar, a staff and scepter, and another item of uncertain iden43 tity. Kayemankh (23) also has a new class of objects that did not appear in the older lists\u2014a whole dockyard of ships and boating equipment. In general, the elaborate system of compartition used by Khabausokar (3) and Hathor-nefer-hetep (4) was not followed, and an entry normally consisted of only two compartments with the name of the object above and the thousand-sign below. Far rarer is the wide compartment with a heading that specifies the nature of the several objects below, provides an indication of the material from which they were made or, in the case of pottery or metal vessels, identifies their contents (21). Equally uncommon is a separate compartment for the determinative (12). The Boston list is unique in the present corpus in placing the thousand sign within the same compartment as the named item, while the lists of Senenu (19, 20) set determinative and thousand-sign side by side in a smaller compartment below the compartment with the name of the item. Grain ricks labeled with their contents and offerings of oxen and fowl are frequently shown in a register beneath the compartment list, although on occasion, both ricks and offerings have compartments of their own (9, 12, 17, 18). Reisner, writing in 1942 when the evidence for the inventory offering list at Giza was rather more limited than at present, assumed that Seshemnofer I (21) had copied the list on the east wall of his chapel from older slab-steles, some of which were then still visible in the necro44 polis. The material available today (15\u201321) suggests rather an unbroken (if not always uniform) development until about the the middle of the Fifth Dynasty (21, 22). Thereafter the inventory offering list does 41 J.E. 42 Cf. 43\nQuibell, The Tomb of Hesy (Cairo, 1913), pls. 6, 7 [1], 10\u201322. Barta, Opferliste, pp. 8\u20139.\nCf. Barta, Opferliste, p. 37.

At Beni Hasan two wn\u00df and two z\u00a3b are shown in a hunt scene (Percy E. Newberry, Beni Hasan 2 [London, 1894], pl. 4). The former pair of animals is larger than the latter.

In the two early furniture lists of Satba and Ni-djefa-nesut (2), items of furniture are represented by ideograms unaccompanied by the phonograms which would indicate the precise word intended. Satba shows a small box with a round handle at the top and a stool(?), while Ni-djefanesut has a double column headrest (c), a small rectangular box, and a vaulted box. In addition, in the list of Merib from the end of Dyn. 4 or early Dyn. 5 (16), ideograms of a stem-type headrest (c) and a bed (a or g) signify the objects depicted, but the other furniture lists spell out the names of the individual items.\n52 Wb.\n1, 142, 14; A.H.

The date involves the vexed question of late Old Kingdom archaism at Giza, on which see recently Nadine Cherpion, \u201cDe quand date la tombe du nain Seneb?,\u201d BIFAO 84 (1984), pp. 35\u201354, and Henry G. Fischer, review of Harpur, Decoration, in BiOr 47, nos. 1/2 (January\u2013March, 1990), p. 90, n. 1. Until this problem is resolved, we follow Barta\u2019s date for the tomb arrived at by an analysis of offering lists. 62 I owe my knowledge of the existence of the two lists of Senenu (19\u201320) to Henry Fischer, who very kindly placed his hand copies, made in 1959, at my disposal.\n128\n08 BROVARSKI Page 129 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:42 PM\nEdward Brovarski, An Inventory List from \u201cCovington\u2019s Tomb\u201d and Nomenclature for Furniture in the Old Kingdom\n(21) Seshemnofer I, inventory list on east wall of chapel, Giza tomb G 4940 (= LG 45); LD 2, pl. 28; Userkaf\u2013Neferirkare, Harpur, Decoration, p. 270.

According to Smith, from the type of mastaba and burial, Reisner dated the tomb of Nefermaat to late Sneferu 65 or early Khufu, and that of Rahotep definitely to the reign of Khufu. Smith himself placed Metjen with Rahotep as the latest of the cruciform chapels. To my mind, the three panels of Nedji, Irensen, and Metjen are closely related in composition, iconography, and palaeography. Although the panel of Rahotep is also related, there are several indications that it is slightly later in date. In all four panels, the thousand-sign appears under each entry in the linen list, but is absent in the inventory list that follows. Beneath the linen list, at the right of each of the first three panels, is an inventory list comprising oils, mantles, and furniture, in that order, but in Rahotep\u2019s case the oils are omitted. Heads of animals and birds appear in a register beneath the inventory list in all four panels. But in Rahotep\u2019s panel the names of the sacrificial animals are spelled out, as in the slab-steles of Seshat-sekhentiu and Princess Meret66 ites from the reign of Khufu. In Metjen\u2019s panel, only the ideogram of the ox-head has a precomplement, n (presumably for ng\u00a3). In Rahotep\u2019s panel, in addition, two of the animal heads appear in the ideographic list beneath the table, which in the other three panels and the niches of Khabau-sokar and Hathor-nefer-hetep, is restricted to bread, beer, alabaster vessels, and linen. Animals also appear beneath the table in several slab67 steles. The small figure of a panther that serves as a determinative of b\u00a3 \u00cdm\u2122w along with the mantle-sign is a specific palaeographic feature 68 linking the panels of Nedji and Irensen. 63\nFor the date, cf. Junker, G\u00eeza 3, pp. 123\u201345. I would like to express my appreciation to Dr. Hawass, General Director of Antiquities of the Giza Pyramids and Saqqara, for allowing me to include the information from the tomb of Kapunesut Kai in advance of his publication. I would also like to thank Ms. Amani Abdel-Hameid for facsimile drawings of the furniture utilized in the present article (with revisions by the author). 64 Barta, Opferliste, p. 156. 65 HESP, p. 149. 66 Reisner, GN 1, pl. 39. 67 Reisner, GN 1, pls. 17, 18 a,19, 20.\n129\n08 BROVARSKI Page 130 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:42 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nIn the following discussion, the investigation of the terms for furniture and their applications in periods later than the Old Kingdom is limited in scope and mainly included for purposes of comparison. a) \u00a3\u2020t \u201ctype de lit le plus simple:\u201d Frises d\u2019objets, p. 243; \u201cdas Bett:\u201d Wb. 1, 23, 12; \u201cdas Bett mit vier F\u00fc\u00dfen:\u201d Junker, G\u00eeza 4, p. 71; \u201cniedriger Sessel (Bett?) mit Rinderf\u00fc\u00dfen:\u201d Hermann Ranke, Die \u00e4gyptischen Personennamen 1 (Gl\u00fcckstadt, 1935), p. 4 [17]. \u00a3\u2020t first occurs, under the simple form \u2020t, in the tomb of Metjen in early Dyn. 4, where an attendant carries a bed so labeled on his back 69 (fig. 2a). The bed has bent wood legs and appears to slope slightly towards the foot. The determinative of \u00a3\u2020t in the slab-stele of the reign of Shepseskaf from a Giza anonymous mastaba is definitely that of a slight70 ly sloping bed with bent wood legs. An identical sign determines st(n)-\u221et (g) in the early lists. The slightly sloping bedframe with bent wood legs (fig. 2b) is only 71 one of three bed types depicted in Old Kingdom scenes of daily life. The second type also has a sloping bedframe but is supported by bull\u2019s 72 73 (fig. 8) or lion\u2019s legs.

With one exception, all these types and sub78 types are identified by the term \u00a3\u2020t. The exception is the sloping bedframe with leonine legs, and this is probably simply the result of insufficient documentation. While animal legs were common on Old Kingdom beds, chairs, and stools, the determinative of \u00a3\u2020t in the furniture list of Izi seemingly goes one step further by providing the bedframe with a lion\u2019s head. The actual bed probably bore a lion\u2019s head at the head end of each of the side poles. Two beds (\u00a3\u2020t) depicted in Sixth Dynasty burial chambers at Heliopolis 79 also have lion heads and legs. 77 Reisner\u2013Smith,\nGiza Necropolis 2, pp. 32\u201333, fig. 33, pls. 25\u201326. nn. 70\u201374. 79 Georges Daressy, \u201cLa n\u00e9cropole des grands pr\u00eatres d\u2019Heliopolis sous l\u2019Ancien Empire I: Inscriptions,\u201d ASAE 16 (1916), pp. 196 [7]; 202 [11]. 78 See\n131\n08 BROVARSKI Page 132 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:42 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nBeds mentioned in Old Kingdom private documents were valuable objects. The well-known \u201cHausurkunde\u201d states that a bed (\u00a3\u2020t) and two 80 different kinds of cloth made up the price paid for a house or tomb. The following death-bed injunction contained in the Letter to the Dead 81 on Cairo Linen CG 25975, from the end of the Dyn. 6 or the decades immediately following, further underscores a bed\u2019s value: \u201cMay the \ufb01 wood of this my bed ( 6 ) which bears me rot(?), should the son 82 of a man be debarred from his household furniture.\u201d In the object friezes on Middle Kingdom coffins the term for bed is \ufb01).83 In the ensuing Second Intermedisometimes spelled \u00a3tyt ( ate Period, in Adm. 3, 5, and 14, 1, the word appears as \u00a3twt, \u00a3t\u00a1wt 84 \ufb01 \ufb01 , ( \ufb01 ). \ufb01 , etc.), which Janssen is of the opinion that the term yt\u00a1t\u00a1 ( appears in several Deir el-Medineh texts mentioning the cost of coffin 85 decoration, is a variant of Old Kingdom \u00a3\u2020t. He further identifies yt\u00a1t as a \u201cfuneral couch\u201d in contrast to \u00a2nkyt, the usual New Kingdom term 86 87 for bed, and \u00a2\u2122t\u00a1, the ordinary type of Deir el-Medineh bed which had 88 a straight wooden frame, four straight legs and matting for \u201csprings.\u201d Since funerary couches often had lion\u2019s heads and legs, like the bed of Izi and the two beds from decorated burial chambers at Heliopolis, and 89 sometimes tails as well, he may be right.

While Ranke wondered whether \u00a3\u2020t might not be the term for a low seat or chair, he was probably misled by the form of the determinative in the name \u00a3\u2020t-k\u00a3, which could easily be mistaken for a seat with 92 animal-legs ( ). However, the determinative of \u00a3\u2020t is sometimes contracted for reasons of space and symmetry. The caption in the tomb of Ti reproduced in fig. 2c, with the width of the determinative half that of the bed depicted below, provides an especially clear instance. b) wrs \u201chead-rest:\u201d Murray, Saqq.

Contained within a box in the object frieze in the tomb of the Third Dynasty official Hesyre are the three most popular types of Old King93 dom headrests (fig. 3a). On the left is a stem type headrest, in the middle a double column type with abacus, and on the right a single column 94 headrest with plain stem and abacus. The different colors and patterns indicate that the first two were made of ebony and the third perhaps of 95 alabaster. All three types of headrests are well represented in the furniture lists. A drawing in the tomb of Kagemni (fig. 3b) may provide evidence for a type of folding headrest, actual examples of which are not known be96 fore the New Kindom. The Wb. provides no references to wrs later in date than the New Kingdom.

W\u2020z appears in the furniture lists of Hathor-nefer-hetep, Rahotep (10), and Seshemnefer I. Hathor-nefer-hetep\u2018s carrying chair was fashioned from ebony. The determinatives approximate in form the carrying chair of Queen Hetepheres I, mother of Khufu, when viewed in pro100 file. The body of the chair with its high back, the curved frame of the armrest on one side, and one of the side boards of the foot rest are all carefully delineated. Due to space limitations, the carrying poles of the chairs are shortened, however. In one of Senenu\u2018s lists appears (20). According to \ufb01 Gardiner, the balance post sign, Old Kingdom , originally had the value 101 w\u2020z and only secondarily acquired the value \u2020z. For that reason, the reading w\u2020zt is probably to be preferred in the present case. Moreover, 102 the New Kingdom word for \u201ccarrying chair\u201d was w\u2020zt. Prof. Goedicke has observed that the carrying chair or litter was a 103 sign of high social rank and importance. The motif of the tomb owner borne in a carrying chair or palanquin recurs in the tombs of a number 104 of high officials of the Old Kingdom beginning with a portrayal in the 105 tomb of Rahotep. There is some evidence to suggest that the use of a carrying chair was a prerogative granted by the king, who also assigned 106 noble youths of the Residence to carry the chair. Indeed, the official Hetep-her-en-ptah received his carrying chair as a boon-which-the-king-\n6 $\n98 R.L.

An even more elaborate theriomorphic throne is described in PT 1124: \u201cHe (viz. the king) sits on this iron throne of his, the faces of which are those of lions, 146 and its feet are the hooves of the Great Wild Bull.\u201d Just such a sign determines \u221endw in PT 1293 a ( ).

On the other hand, many of these types of seats probably incorporated minor bent wood elements, such as small angular braces, and these may have constituted the tie that binds. In the New Kingdom and later, the term acquires a new, if related, 150 meaning: \u201cstairway, (flight of) steps,\u201d especially of a throne or chapel. g) st-(n)-\u221et \u201cseat of wood:\u201d Murray, Saqq.

This is the earlier of the two Old Kingdom words for bed. Only in Kha-bau-sokar\u2019s furniture list, where st-n-\u221et \u201cbed of wood\u201d appears, does the indirect genitive occur. Otherwise, except for Hathor-neferhetep\u2019s list, where \u221et follows st directly, st-\u221et is usually written with \u221et in apposition, to indicate the material of which the bed is made (9\u201310, 151 In the lists of Khabausokar and his wife Hathor-nefer-hetep, 14, 23). where the term is subsumed under the heading \u201cs\u00a3\u2202-wood,\u201d the element \u221et \u201cwood\u201d seems redundant. In place of \u221et, Senenu (19) has mnq152 wood. The determinative in the early furniture-lists of Khabausokar and Hathor-nefer-hetep, as well as in both of Rahotep\u2019s lists, is a gently sloping bedframe with bent wood legs. In the published photographs and drawings of the first two lists, the determinatives are on too small a scale to be certain, but in both of Rahotep\u2019s lists the lower bend of the 149 For\nthis innovation, see Baker, Furniture, pp. 63, 128\u201329; Killen, Furniture, pp. 51\u201352, and the chairs numbered 4 and 5. The earliest depiction of such a chair known to me is in a stele of the reign of Senusert I; see William Kelly Simpson, The Terrace of the Great God at Abydos (New Haven, 1974), pl. 51 (ANOC 33.1).

The same sort of bed (on wide drums) appears in a craft scene in the \u201cTomb of the Two Brothers\u201d (fig. 2b), but 153 here the bed is designated by the later term, \u00a3\u2020t (a).

Verner remarks that the arms of the first man are turned backwards, which implies that he must have been carrying a sizeable object together with the second 155 man behind him. The piece of furniture carried by the two figures is likewise destroyed, but an upright element in the space between the rear arm and body of the first figure, which may represent a footboard, 156 The third man evidently suggests that the object was probably a bed. held an angled backrest (j) over one shoulder. The pair of figures bringing up the rear of the procession carry between them an arm chair with high back and lion\u2019s paw legs.

In the tomb of Kayemankh at Giza, for example, a number of attendants prepare an armchair and bed, 159 The legthe former set within a canopy, for their master\u2019s use (fig. 8). 160 end to the former vignette reads w\u221e\u00a3 st \u201cdusting the armchair,\u201d while over the latter is written wdt \u00a3\u2020t, \u201cmaking the bed.\u201d The armchair has a high back, square supports on the sides for elbows and arms, and side rails terminating in papyrus flower ornaments, while its bull\u2019s legs rest on fulcrum-shaped supports.

Going one step further, Henry Fischer has suggested that st in origin perhaps designated any \u201cpiece of furniture on which one rested, whether seated 162 or reclining.\u201d Erman in fact was of the opinion that the Egyptian bed was really 163 only a broader seat. Beds from the early dynastic tombs of Tarkhan are so short that a sleeper would have to curl up tightly when taking ad164 vantage of one. Actual early dynastic beds are usually low, rarely ex165 When depicted ceeding 30.8 cm, and chairs are often no higher. together in Old Kingdom daily life scenes, beds and chairs usually appear 166 to be of similar height. Externally then, there is little to distinguish theriomorphic beds and chairs except breadth and the presence of a footboard in lieu of a low backrest. Perhaps for these reasons, the Egyptians did not draw a sharp distinction between beds and chairs. To return to st-(n)-\u221et. Although beds with bent wood supports are sometimes labeled \u00a3\u2020t (a), as far as can be judged from the surviving evidence, st-(n)-\u221et is only applied to the type of sloping bed with bent wood supports, never to the other two types of Old Kingdom beds (above, p. 130). This may reflect the nature of the evidence, however, since st alone does refer to theriomorphic beds in the tombs of Kayemankh and Werirenptah. h) st \u00a2ms \u201cStuhl zum Sitzen:\u201d Junker, G\u00eeza 4, p. 71. We have just seen that the term st, generally translated \u201cseat, throne,\u201d also possessed the meaning \u201cbed\u201d in the Old Kingdom. This dual usage perhaps explains the existence of the term st-\u00a2ms \u201ca seat for sitting\u201d in the furniture list of Kayemankh. The sign , which functions as a determinative of st-\u00a2ms in the list of Kayemankh (and as a logogram in st-[n]-\u221et elsewhere), seemingly reflects the form of the simple high-backed chair with straight legs which is attested in relief as 167 early as the Second Dynasty. 162 Henry\nGeorge Fischer, \u201cStuhl,\u201d L\u00c4 6 (1985), col. 92.

Portable chairs in Old Kingdom tombs.\na\nc\nThere is no question that st by itself could refer to seats during the Old Kingdom. Above, we have seen that Kayemankh\u2019s bull-legged armchair is designated a st. An arm chair with lion\u2019s legs in the tomb of the 168 vizier Ptahshepses is likewise denominated. In the Pyramid Texts st is applied to a \u201cthrone\u201d with bull\u2019s legs and papyrus terminals on the 169 side-rails ( ). In two other spells, the determinative of st is a lionheaded, bull-legged throne, the same sign that elsewhere in this corpus 170 of religious literature serves as the determinative of \u221endw (f). It is possible that \u00a3\u2020t (a) appeared at a time when the word st came increasingly to be applied to proper seats of various forms. Evidence for this conjecture may be provided by the furniture list of Izi. In that list \u00a3\u2020t 167\nBaker, Furniture, pp. 32\u201333, 51; figs. 24\u201325.

Fischer, Dendera in the Third Millennium B.C. (Locust Valley, NY, 1968), pp. 102\u20133 and pl. 7.

Bull\u2019s leg were used as furniture sup188 ports from the earliest period, but not ordinarily for angled backrests. The only other instance known to me comes from the tomb of Kayemrehu (fig. 13a). The form of the mattress also seems to have attracted the interest of the artist, who shows in considerable detail how it was attached to the frame by a webbing (presumably made of leather straps) 189 woven through slots in the side and bottoms of the rails. The leather thongs that fastened the top of the leg to the frame are indicated as well. Like those of the longer, two-legged bed shown in plan at the right, the 190 projecting side-rails of this backrest end in papyrus flower terminals. The two-legged bed on the upper right seems to have consisted of thirteen cross planks originally, but only five were still visible when 191 Quibell recorded Hesyre\u2019s paintings. The artist here omits the legs which presumably supported the head end. The two-legged bed below and corresponding backrest on the other side of the mast are drawn in elevation. Both have bent wood supports and drums. Two-legged beds appear to have passed out of fashion after Dyn. 3, but two-legged, angled backrests continue to be found in scenes which show the tomb owner on outings\u2014generally tours of inspection\u2014where they are carried by an attendant along with other personal equipment 192 (fig. 12b\u2013d). In the tomb of Metjen the context is not so clear. To either side of the entrance on the east wall of the chapel, short processions of offering 193 bearers appear above a large figure of the tomb owner. Whereas Metjen faces the doorway, the bearers have their backs to the entrance, as if walking into the tomb. One of the bearers to the north of the entrance carries an angled backrest (fig. 12a), while the man immediately behind him holds a headrest. On the west wall of the chapel (to the south of the false door) a large figure of Metjen views a very abbreviated 194 hunting scene, which is continued on the south wall.

It is possible that the three groups of attendants on the walls of Metjen\u2019s chapel are associated thematically with the only scene from life in the chapel, the hunting scene on the west and south walls, that is, as transporting equipment needed for his outing on the gebel. In Room 3 of the tomb of the vizier Ptahshepses at Abusir, processions of attendants march with furniture, boxes, and cases toward the 196 The large figure of the vizier entrance, as if preceding out of the tomb. on the southern part of the east wall is similarly oriented, and this might 197 well be another example of a tomb owner\u2019s outing. What appears to be an angled backrest occurs in the damaged scene on the rear wall of 198 199 Room 3 to the south of a doorway (fig. 7). Although Verner identifies this object as a bed, the manner in which the badly damaged figure holds it indicates that the article of furniture was in fact a two-legged angled backrest; compare fig. 12a\u2013c. Finally, in the Fifth Dynasty tomb of Nesutnofer at Giza, a dwarf carries the owner\u2019s headrest in his right hand and a two-legged angled 200 backrest over his shoulder in his other hand (fig. 12c). In the register below, a second dwarf holds the owner\u2019s staff and sandles, while above, two Nubians carry other personal items. Between the two doors in the west wall, the owner and his wife stand viewing the presentation of animals and goods from his estates in Upper Egypt. The presence of the animals shows that this event takes place in the open air, and it is likely that the four attendants were understood to be in attendance on the owner on this outing, even though separated from him by the intervening false door. Two-legged angled backrests also appear in scenes showing the preparation of funerary equipment. One, in the tomb of Kayemrehu, is about half the size of the bed being polished by two squatting carpenters in the\n195 LD\n2, pl. 6.

In the tomb of the Two Brothers, a carpenter planes a gs\u00a3wt with an 202 adze (fig. 13b). This backrest, like most of those depicted elsewhere and the bed being worked on nearby, has a bent wood support and drums, the whole resting on low, fulcrum-shaped supports. It is about a third the length of the bed. In the burial chamber of Kayemankh, an angled headrest is depicted 203 along with other household furniture. This backrest has bent wood supports ending in drums on fulcrum-shaped supports and, most unexpectedly, is equipped with a high footboard (fig. 13c). Resting on it are a cushion, headrest, and fly whisk. It is portrayed as about the same size as the bed, which is being made up by a servant, but both bed and servant are much smaller than they should be relative to the portable armchair and leather bag in the same register. The relative proportions of the backrest, headrest, and flywhisk to one another, on the other hand, seem about right. A number of conclusions emerge from this review of the occurences of gs(\u00a3)wt in the Early Dynastic Period and Old Kingdom. First, the early gs(\u00a3)wt depicted in the painted corridor of Hesyre\u2014both the two-legged beds and the angled backrests\u2014appear to be considerably longer than the later Old Kingdom examples. Second, by the early Fourth Dynasty at the latest, smaller gs(\u00a3)wt existed which, from their size, can only have functioned as backrests. The latter appear to have been only a half to a third as long as ordinary beds, and unlike them could be easily transported. Only in the tomb of Metjen does a single bearer carry with difficulty this larger piece of furniture (fig. 2a). With a two-legged backrest of the later type, the user presumably sat on a mat and reclined against the backrest. It is unlikely that he would have rested his upper body on the mat with his legs and feet resting on the backrest. The curious backrest provided with a footboard in the tomb of Kaemankh (fig. 13c) would leave the user\u2019s upper torso projecting at an acute angle above the ground. It is probably a mistake, falsely 204 echoing the high board at the foot of the bed in the same register. James Allen suggests plausibly that gs\u00a3wt derives from gs\u00a3 \u201cto lean, 205 incline.\u201d But the later gs(\u00a3)wt at least were essentially half-beds.

Goedicke has noted that the fragmentary inscription is in part probably a literal parallel to Urk. 1, 43, 16, which should be restored according212 ly. The latter passage belongs to the biography of the vizier Washptah who, like the Goedicke\u2019s anonymous official, was taken ill in the presence of the king, and who was similarly provided with a carrying chair (\u221ewdt) by his sovereign, who also assigned ten men \u201cto carry him in it in perpetuity.\u201d Ten would be an overly large number of men to transport an ordinary carrying chair like Queen Hetepheres I\u2019s, which can not 213 have accomodated more than four men at a time. This raises the possibility that \u221ewdt actually refers to the later sort of Old Kingdom carrying chair which was surmounted by a baldachin comprising an elaborate vaulted or rectangular superstructure of wood supported on light columns, and which might require as many as twenty-eight porters to bear 212 Ibid., 213 See\np. 9. above, p. 134.\n153\n08 BROVARSKI Page 154 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:42 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\n214\nit aloft. The possibility appears to be borne out by the song of the porters who bear Djau Shemai in state in just such a palanquin (fig. 14c): hr \ufb02r(y)w \u221ewdt nfr.s m\u00a2 r wnn.s \u00dfwt \u201cHappy are they who bear the palan215 quin. Better is it when full than when it is empty.\u201d The appearance of \u221ewdt/\u221ewdd as a label above the carrying-chairs without baldachin in the two workshop scenes at Deir el-Gebrawi might be seen as constituting an obstacle to this identification. So too might the fact that the determinative of \u221ewdt in the fragmentary inscription published by Goedicke and the biography of Washptah is an ordinary carrying chair. Nevertheless, the sign that determines \u221ewdt in the porters\u2019 song just quoted is essentially the same sign that determines \u221ewdt in the carpentry scene from the tomb of Djau Shemai referred to at the head of this entry. Possibly the ancient painter or scribe hesitated at drawing so large and elaborate an object as a carrying chair with baldachin for a determinative, and settled for the simpler sign which defined the meaning of the word in a more general way. A similar consideration perhaps prevented the draughtsman from inserting so large an object into a workshop scene. An additional point in favor of the identification of \u221ewdt as a \u201ccarrying-chair with baldachin\u201d may be the survival of the older term for \u201ccarrying-chair (without baldachin),\u201d w\u2020z(t), into the New Kingdom and 216 217 later as w\u2020zt (d), since both Middle and New Kingdom carrying218 chairs generally lack a baldachin.

Mein Gewand (peplos) hat kein Sterblicher je aufgehoben (Plutarch). Das, was ist, das, was sein wird, und das, was war, bin ich. Mein Gewand (chiton) hat niemand aufgehoben. Die Frucht, die ich gebar, wurde die Sonne (Proklos).\nDie Philologen haben zu recht festgestellt, da\u00df die \u00e4ltere Fassung die Pr\u00e4dikationsformel \u201cich bin\u201d richtig voranstellt, doch bei Proklos ist die Version in zwei Punkten \u00fcberlegen: Erstens bringt sie einen dritten Satz, der allein die Bedeutung des zweiten erhellt, und zweitens steht dort \u201cniemand\u201d (oudeis) statt \u201ckein Sterblicher\u201d (Plutarch). Diese beiden Abweichungen des Proklos von Plutarch lassen erst den Hintersinn des Textes erkennen. Griffiths hat mit vollem Recht darauf hingewiesen, da\u00df das \u201cAufheben\u201d des Gewandes \u201cclearly sexual\u201d ist. Seinen genauen Sinn aber erschlie\u00dft erst Proklos, indem er auf die \u201cFrucht\u201d Horus hinweist. Die 2 1\nPlutarch, De Iside, Kap. 9 (354C).

Isis hat den Leichnam ihres Gatten Osiris soweit wiederbelebt, da\u00df sie ihren Sohn empfangen konnte, indem sie \u201cdie Rolle des Mannes gespielt hat, obwohl sie doch eine Frau\u201d war.3 Auf diesen Akt spielt der zweite Satz der Inschrift an und besagt, da\u00df ihr bei der Zeugung des Horus kein Mann (aktiv) beigewohnt, keiner \u201cihr Gewand gehoben\u201d habe,4 eben auch nicht Osiris. Somit trifft \u201cniemand\u201d richtiger als \u201ckein Sterblicher.\u201d Der Sinn der Inschrift wird erst durch den dritten Satz deutlich, indem als \u201cFrucht\u201d5 Horus, Horus als Sonnengott, genannt ist. Die beiden letzten S\u00e4tze des Proklos enth\u00fcllen damit den Sinn des Textes als eine Umschreibung der \u00fcbernat\u00fcrlichen Zeugung des Heilbringers. Durch die Proklos-Version bzw. -Erweiterung wird zugleich die Legitimit\u00e4t des Sohnes betont. Kein anderer Mann au\u00dfer der tote Osiris\u2014der aber auch in sexueller Hinsicht kein voller Mann mehr ist\u2014 kommt als Vater ihres Sohnes in Frage. Die Betonung der \u00dcbernat\u00fcrlichkeit der Empf\u00e4ngnis war f\u00fcr Horus besonders wichtig, da Rationalisten, die es in hellenistischer Zeit gewi\u00df auch in \u00c4gypten gab, leicht nachrechnen konnten, da\u00df Osiris nicht der Vater sein k\u00f6nne, weil er doch vor mehr als 9 Monaten gestorben war, die Byblos-Episode eingerechnet, weit mehr als der Schwangerschaftsperiode. Durch den Hinweis auf die supranaturale Empf\u00e4ngnis wird von vornherein jeder Verdacht auf eine illegitime Vaterschaft abgewiesen. Das vorliegende Mythologumenon gliedert sich in die Reihe der extraordin\u00e4ren Zeugungen des Heilbringers als eine neue Variante ein. Im Geburtsmythos der Pharaonen ist bekanntlich der Vater ein Gott. Um den Gemahl der K\u00f6nigin als Erzeuger auszuschlie\u00dfen, wird von ihm behauptet, er sei noch ein \u00a1npw, ein Kind,6 nach Plutarch/ 3 Wilhelm\nSpiegelberg \u201cEine neue Legende \u00fcber die Geburt des Horus,\u201d Z\u00c4S 53 (1917), S. 94 ff. Auf diese Stelle weist auch Griffiths, a.a.O. (Anm. 1), S. 284, Anm. 6, hin. 4 Die sonderbare Erz\u00e4hlung bei Plutarch, Kap. 17 (357 D/E), Isis habe \u201cin der Einsamkeit\u201d den Sarg ge\u00f6ffnet, ihr Gesicht an das des Osiris gepre\u00dft, ihn umarmt und beweint; der mitgenommene Prinz aus Byblos habe die Szene zuf\u00e4llig gesehen und sei durch den w\u00fctenden Blick der Isis get\u00f6tet worden\u2014diese Erz\u00e4hlung ist wohl ebenfalls als eine dezente Beschreibung der Zeugungsszene zu verstehen. Der t\u00f6dliche Zorn der Isis bleibt sonst unverst\u00e4ndlich. Im pharaonischen \u00c4gypten l\u00e4\u00dft sich diese mythische Szene bis ins MR zur\u00fcckverfolgen. Zwar ist sie nicht h\u00e4ufig, aber eindeutig dargestellt, wobei ebenfalls Dezenz gewahrt blieb: Isis erscheint als Vogel. Die bekannte Osiris-Bahre aus Abydos/Umm al-Qa\u2122ab, jetzt im Lichthof des Museums in Kairo, ist das \u00e4lteste Beispiel. Das St\u00fcck stammt aus der 13. Dynastie, Chen-Djer, s.

Immerhin weist Griffiths eine Stelle aus der Zeit Hadrians nach, in der Isis als \u201creine Jungfrau\u201d bezeichnet wird.7 Demnach war auch diese Variante der hellenistischen Glaubenssprache noch nicht \u00fcberlebt, und sie lenke nun noch kurz auf die neutestamentlichen Aussagen \u00fcber die Geburt des Heilbringers Jesus. Bei Matth\u00e4us (1,18) und Lukas (1,28\u201335) wird berichtet, da\u00df der Heiland vom Heiligen Geist gezeugt sei, der die Frau \u201c\u00fcberschatten\u201d werde.8 Dem naheliegenden Verdacht einer Vaterschaft des Joseph wird gewehrt durch den Bericht, Maria sei diesem Manne \u201cverlobt\u201d gewesen\u2014ein j\u00fcdisches Rechtsinstitut jener Zeit, da\u00df eine Verpflichtung zur Heirat ein-, aber eine Beiwohnung nach strenger Sitte ausschlo\u00df. Die fr\u00fche Christenheit fand, als dies Institut nicht mehr bekannt war, die Erkl\u00e4rung, da\u00df Joseph ein alter Mann gewesen sei, dem \u201cdie Manneskraft geschwunden\u201d war, wie es Ptah-hotep ausdr\u00fcckt. Au\u00dferdem bietet Matth\u00e4us den Traum Josephs, in dem ihm ein Engel das Wunder der Zeugung durch den Heiligen Geist mitteilt. Nirgends ist die Jungfr\u00e4ulichkeit selbst das Wunder, das Wunder ist vielmehr das Erscheinen des Heilbringers, dessen Zeugung oder Geburt mirakul\u00f6s umschrieben wird. Erst eine sexualfeindliche Zeit hat den Akzent dieser mythischen Aussagen in die Richtung der Jungfr\u00e4ulichkeit verschoben. Aber die vielen Varianten des Mythologumenons vom pharaonischen \u00c4gypten bis in sp\u00e4thellenistisch-fr\u00fchr\u00f6mische Zeiten sagen alle das gleiche Theologumenon aus: Die wunderbare \u00fcbernat\u00fcrliche Zeugung (oder Geburt) des Bringers eines neuen Aion (wie Norden sagt) oder einfach des Tr\u00e4gers einer neuen Heilszeit. In dieser Kette ist das Zeugnis der Inschrift der Isis/Neith-Statue in Sais\u2014sei sie nun griechisch oder \u00e4gyptisch konzipiert oder gar fiktiv\u2014ein weiterer Beleg.9\nb\n6\nZu dieser Bezeichnung und ihrer Bedeutung in unserem Zusammenhang, s. in dem grundlegenden Werk Brunner, Geburt des Gottk\u00f6nigs, S. 27 ff. 7 K.

Bryan\nA\nlthough in most cases inscriptions are read in concert with the objects on which they are placed, if they are considered separately it may be possible to identify two distinct messages 1 comprehended by different audiences. A stela from Abydos, (fig. 1) recently republished by Anthony Leahy, illustrates well the disjunction of text and image possible in monumental settings. Due to the hieroglyphic readability of both writing and art, some elements of both were often mixed in monumental settings: for example, as early as the Third Dynasty, \ufb02kr and \u2202d signs were used as decorative elements on architectural friezes at the Step Pyramid and were no doubt intended to be read as well as viewed. Even the illiterate, then, if they resided near cult centers, must have known some royal and divine iconography, and must also have been familiar with a number of hieroglyphic signifiers, such as cartouches and serekhs with falcons atop as identifications of rulers; or lapwings as writings of r\u221eyt, particularly combined with the dw\u00a3 sign to 2 designate stations for people within temples. The mixture of hieroglyphic forms with artistic compositional principles on this Abydos stela\u2019s lunette scene would therefore have been readable: not as to the specific royal names, but rather as to the iconographies of king and divinity as well as the meaning of their placements and gestures. Leahy\u2019s discussion was largely centered on the stela inscription, but he nonetheless carefully illustrated the entire stela and discussed its lunette scene briefly. The text, a decree of the Thirteenth Dynasty, (which Leahy showed to have been reused in the same dynasty) forbade the building of tombs in the Wepwawet area of Abydos as marked by the stela. It also granted tomb construction outside the area designated by 1\nCairo JE 35256.

Bryan, The Disjunction of Text and Image in Egyptian Art\nthe stela. The inscription was thus directed at the literate wealthy who might attempt to place constructions in the area. The lunette scene, on the other hand, would have been viewed and understood by literate elites and nonliterate alike. In that scene the king\u2019s Horus and cartouche names appear facing the name of the god Wepwawet, the writing of which was determined by a striding jackal on a standard. Possibly this determinative, a common writing for Wep3 wawet, represented a processional cult emblem of that god. The \u2122n\u221e and w\u00a3s signs are projecting out to the falcon atop the Horus name from the standard, enduing the king (through his name) with those two properties. The winged sun disk identified stretches across the top, with the limits of Egypt identified as the northern and southern cult centers of Horus of Behdet. It is useful to consider what the lunette scene and the form of a stela generally would communicate were the text lacking. Indeed, set in its original location the stela, absent its main inscription, would alert any viewer that it is a royal decree and therefore important to heed. In addition the lunette establishes Wepwawet, a god from a neighboring cult center, at Abydos, and it demonstrates that the king is favored by 4 that god in particular. The form of the stela, therefore, alerted the nonliterate to the king\u2019s relationship with Wepwawet, perhaps in a processional emblematic form, thereby increasing the ruler\u2019s association with that god in whatever role he played at Abydos. The stela\u2019s siting may have further suggested a specific association within Abydos generally. This message for the illiterate was an entirely positive one with regard to the ruler and his cult involvement. Whether the particular ruler would have been known to the viewer is, of course, not possible to say. We should acknowledge, however, that nonliteracy, like literacy, has degrees, and some may have known more signs than others. Some may also have been aware of the reason for the stela\u2019s erection. As Leahy\u2019s discussion of the stela inscription reveals, the Thirteenth Dynasty rulers were unusual in their personal participation in the 5 Osirian festivals held at Abydos. Thus the inscription, for Leahy, was composed and recarved on occasions of two Thirteenth Dynasty rulers attending such festivities. In addition, Leahy, following Kemp, argued persuasively that the protected region referred to in the inscription was 3 Wb.\n1, p. 202,16. F. Gomaa, Die Besiedlung \u00c4gyptens w\u00e4hrend des Mittleren Reiches, TAVO Beihefte (Wiesbaden, 1986), p. 202, with n. 16, for Wepwawet as resident in Abydos. 5 Ibid., pp. 59\u201360. Leahy notes the distinction between Thirteenth Dynasty rulers who attended the festivals in person and Twelfth Dynasty kings who sent emissaries. 4 See\n163\n10 BRYAN Page 164 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:45 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nthe wadi leading from the Osiris temple toward the archaic tombs of the 6 First Dynasty at Umm el Qa`ab. He states that \u201cthe reason for the dedication of the area to Wepwawet also becomes clear; it was he who as \u2018Opener of the Ways,\u2019 led the sequence of processions in the Osiris 7 mysteries.\u201d Thus the lunette\u2019s message of royal association with Wepwawet in a processional form was background for the inscription itself. For those who could read, however, the message was quite different from that of royal association with Wepwawet and involvement with the Abydene mysteries. The literate were informed of the prohibition from building tombs in the area, a point that was no doubt intended to enforce the ruler\u2019s own wishes with regard to the processional and cemetery space. This was a message of power asserted over the affluent whose actions were potentially a threat to the crown. At the same time, the king\u2019s granting of construction outside his protected area, further insisted on his overall ability to dispense privileges. As Leahy states, \u201cthe fact that no burials were made in the wadi before Roman times, whereas the areas on either side of it were used and reused, confirms 8 both the identification and the success of the decree.\u201d Ultimately text and image speak to two distinct audiences with the appropriate message of royal display and power. Egyptian art communicates without text and with it. Although it often does, art does not necessarily coincide with text in the meaning it 9 conveys. Nor, then, does text in monumental uses, necessarily purely 10 caption the art, as most writers have argued it does. Rather, art may provide a different version of the same subject expressed in accompanying text. For example, although the visual cues provided by the scenes from Ramesses II\u2019s Kadesh Battle reliefs at the Ramesseum, Karnak, 11 Luxor Temple, Abydos, and Abu Simbel (fig. 2) are not identical, the 6 Ibid.,\np. 54, after Barry Kemp, Lexikon der \u00c4gyptologie 1, col. 37.\n7 Ibid. 8 Ibid. 9\nThomas von der Way, in his excellent study, Die Text\u00fcberlieferung Ramses\u2019 II. zur Qade\u00df-Schlacht: Analyse und Struktur, (Hildesheim, 1984), Introduction, notes that the texts and reliefs do not often coincide, but concludes that the text can stand alone, while the reliefs cannot. This I would argue is not the case. 10 While Roland Tefnin, \u201cImage, \u00e9criture, r\u00e9cit. A propos des repr\u00e9sentations de la bataille de Qadesh,\u201d GM 47 (1981), pp. 55\u201378, was certainly mindful of the interconnections of text and image, he was not sensitive to the dissonance conveyed by the Kadesh reliefs placed next to the accompanying legends and War Bulletin. The most difficult view to accept is that of Alan H. Gardiner, The Kadesh Inscriptions of Ramesses II (Oxford, 1960), who attempted a chart to place text and image opposite one another to demonstrate their coincidence. It was a failure. 11 Charles\n164\nKuentz, La Bataille de Qadech, MIFAO 55 (Cairo, 1928\u20131934).\n10 BRYAN Page 165 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:45 PM\nBetsy M. Bryan, The Disjunction of Text and Image in Egyptian Art\nFig. 2. Kadesh Battle Relief from Luxor Temple, after drawing in K. Kitchen, Pharaoh Triumphant (Warminster, 1988), figs. 18\u201319.\nessential elements of the camp, the fort of Kadesh, the Orontes river around it, and the meeting of chariot warriors exist in all versions. However, the serious predicament in which Ramesses II found himself during the battle, as described in the Poem and/or the Bulletin or relief inscriptional legends are largely not evident in the reliefs themselves.\n165\n10 BRYAN Page 166 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:45 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nLacking the texts, the viewer would conclude that Ramesses II was 12 victorious against the vile Hittite foe, apparently nearly all alone. It is interesting to point out that one consistent addition was the mission of the Egyptian vizier to hurry the army for the ruler. Although many Egyptologists might conclude that the uncomplicat13 ed nature of the relief story underscores the dependence of art on text, it is more likely an illustration that Egyptian art was directed at more than one constituency, depending on whether the text was to be read or not. The nature of audience for monumental reliefs and inscriptions is problematic, but it would certainly be wise to consider first the low 14 literacy levels in the New Kingdom. Even those who read hieratic reasonably well might have had difficulty seeing and reading monumental hieroglyphic texts on temple pylons. In addition, in my opinion, monumental Egyptian art was not intended as argument, but rather as state15 ment. The work of persuasion must have taken place before the monumentalizing, i.e., before the statement was, quite literally, \u201cset in stone.\u201d Those who could read the text most probably knew of it as the story it tells was being composed. The statement of the monument in the reign of Ramesses II, and later as well, to the vast non-literate majority of the population was a reminder of pharaoh\u2019s victories, specific and continuous, on behalf of Egypt and its gods. The statement to the literate government elites provided an explanation of Egypt\u2019s poor performance at Kadesh. To conclude from the Kadesh texts, the army, largely an illiterate group led by officers answerable to the crown, was the scapegoat offered to the government bureaucrats. It is noteworthy that the mission of the vizier to hasten the army of Ptah\u2019s assistance to Ramesses II was prominently labeled in the reliefs. The court official did his duty, while, as could be read in full in the \u201cPoem,\u201d the army disgraced itself by its cowardly per16 formance in battle.\n12\nThe conclusions reached also by von der Way and Tefnin, op.cit., but without further analysis of the meaning of this disjunction. 13 See above, concerning von der Way. In addition to Gardiner, Lichtheim too appears not to have noticed the discrepancy of reliefs and texts, seeming to think them inevitably read together; Gardiner, The Kadesh Inscriptions of Ramesses II, p. 26; Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature 2 (Berkeley, 1976), p. 58. 14 Even if one considers the Baines and Eyre estimate to be low, one would hardly push literacy above the level of 5% of the population; J. Baines and C. Eyre, \u201cFour notes on literacy,\u201d GM 61 (1983), pp. 65\u201396. 15 Michael Baxandall, Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy: A Primer in the Social History of Pictorial Style (Oxford, 1972), provides a similar view.\n166\n10 BRYAN Page 167 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:45 PM\nBetsy M. Bryan, The Disjunction of Text and Image in Egyptian Art\nIt is a significant point in this example that the small number of elites who could read would not have interpreted the monuments of Ramesses II in the same way as the vast public. For this last group the temples were in any case distant and restricted centers of authority, royal and religious. Nonetheless a complete message was communicated to both audiences. We cannot estimate with any certainty the degree to which the owner of a monument depended on the separate and combined messages of art and inscription. We are safe, however, in assuming that all those who viewed a monument did not take away the same message. For example, a statue of a man and woman in a private decorated tomb chapel of the New Kingdom might depict the couple arm in arm, at the same scale. Stylistically, they would both have the features of the reigning king and iconographical details that identified them with a particular generation. A female family member visiting the chapel would most likely have been illiterate, but would have recognized both a man and woman as primary recipients of the statue\u2019s benefits. A male visitor, at the elite tomb-owning level of society, on the other hand, would possibly have been literate and therefore able to learn that the statue might have had an overwhelming preponderance of inscriptions relating 17 to the man, or conversely might mention the woman prominently. The impressions of the two visitors about the statue owners would not have been identical and yet both received the communication of the monument. Indeed, this dissonance in text and image can be found on nearly every inscribed object and must assert that the function of text with image was other than caption or explication. Rather, in the monumental setting the text preserved a statement that few could comprehend and appreciate. Although that statement was not intended as argument to the viewer, its very monumentalization and its limited accessibility made it likely to have been prestigious. This prestige might have invoked a \u201cdialogue\u201d between viewer and monument.

In 1916, the Boston Athenaeum acquired three New Kingdom painted linen panels dedicated to Hathor, along with a collection of 124 inscribed mummy bandages.1 The painted textiles had formed part of the collection of Robert de Rustafjaell,2 and their provenance was said to be \u201ca mound of debris on the site of the Temple of Hathor at Thebes.\u201d3 Several other similar cloths from this collection are now scattered in museums throughout the world, and have been determined to derive from Deir el-Bahri, where additional examples were excavated by the Egypt Exploration Society in the Eleventh Dynasty temple.4 Eleven are featured in Geraldine Pinch\u2019s work on votive offerings.5 The three textiles discussed here are an addition to Pinch\u2019s corpus. All three examples are votive textiles, and two were dedicated by members of the same family. Both of these consist of rectangular pieces of rather coarse linen. The larger scene (fig. 2) measures 27.5 cm tall and 24.5 cm wide, excluding fringe. The piece is fringed on top and sides (see appendix for further details of construction).

Seven figures are depicted worshipping Hathor, who appears as a cow. At the top of the upper register appears a horizontal red line, with a series of small vertical strokes under it. On the left, the forepart of the Hathor cow, painted yellow, emerges from the Western Mountain. The cow is adorned with a black broad collar with an indistinct black and red terminal. A red menat is placed at the back of the cow\u2019s neck. Facing her are three figures. A bare-headed man wearing a diaphanous pleated kilt and blue broad collar raises his left hand in adoration, as do all of the other figures pictured. His right hand holds a censer above a table flanked by floral offerings. Behind him is the figure of a nude child, with right arm extended down. Behind the child stands a woman wearing a long, full black wig, blue broad collar, and long, diaphanous garment with sleeves. Her right hand grasps a long-necked jar, from which a libation is poured. The bottom register is very worn, but depicts a procession of three women led by a man. The man, who is dressed in a fashion similar to the man in the upper register, holds a duck by its wings in his right hand. The details of dress of the three women are not well preserved, but the first wears a long, diaphanous dress with blue broad collar and full black wig, and holds the same type of vessel as the woman in the upper register. The accompanying text is brief and gives only names and titles. The goddess is identified as \u201cMistress of the West, Mistress of Heaven, Mistress of all the gods\u201d (nbt \u2044mnt, nbt pt, \u00a2nwt n\u2020rw nbw). Each of the donors is identified in a short vertical text. The figures in the upper register may be considered the principal donors, and their names are consequently preceded by \u00a1r n. The man is the \u201cdraughtsman, Hunure\u201d (s\u00df \u02dadwt \u00ccnr),6 and the woman is the \u201cmistress of the house, Kharu\u201d (nbt-\n6\nFor the spelling of the name, see Hermann Ranke, Die \u00c4gyptischen Personennamen 1 (Gl\u00fcckstadt, 1935), p. 245, no. 7.

The man at the head of the procession is identified as \u201cthe scribe, Khonsu-hotep,\u201d (s\u00df \u00d3nsw-\u00a2tp),9 and the woman following him is the mistress of the house, Huy (nbt-pr \u00cc\u00a1\u00a1). The second woman incorporates the name of Isis into her name, but the other signs are almost completely obliterated, save for a seated woman determinative. Hunure, Kharu, and her son Huy appear again on the second textile, (fig. 1) which measures 27 cm high by 22.5 cm wide. It is manufactured of a rather coarse linen similar to that of the first example, and is fringed on the top and right side. Unfortunately, the piece as a whole is not as well preserved as the first example. Much of the decoration of the left side is gone, and there is a triangular loss from the lower left. This textile contains a single scene, framed once again at the top with a frieze of white lotus petals on a blue ground, and at sides and bottom with a linear border in black and red. The figures of the three worshippers are rendered in a fashion similar to the first textile. Hunure is bare-headed and wears a blue broad collar, but the the lower part of his kilt is worn away, as are any objects that he holds. The lady Kharu again wears a long garment with sleeves, blue broad collar, and long, full, curly wig, ornamented by a tall perfumed cone decorated with a lotus flower at the front. She holds a tall-necked jar, under which the tiny figure of her son appears. The depiction of the goddess Hathor has been entirely obliterated, as has most of the inscription above her missing image. Only her name and two nb-signs at the top of the columns can be identified with certainty. The remainder of the text once again identifies Hunure with the title s\u00df \u02dadwt, and introduces his name with \u00a1r n. Kharu is named as nbt pr, and Huy is labelled as her son. Two textiles matching the description of those dedicated by Hunure are listed in a 1913 auction catalogue of the Rustafjaell collection, but are described there as \u201cattached in the centre by the horizontal threads of canvas.\u201d10 Close examination reveals that the fringe originally joining the two scenes was cut between 1913 and their acquisition in 1916 by the Athenaeum, in order to bind the textiles into the volume in 7\nRanke, Personennamen 1, cf. p. 273, no. 20. The final signs of the name appear behind the figure of its owner, and are badly worn, but they are confirmed on the second textile; see below. 8 Ranke,\nPersonennamen 1, p. 233, no. 18. p. 271, no. 12. 10 Catalogue of the Remaining Part of the Valuable Collection, p. 51, no. 577.

The double scene is unusual, but accounts for the fact that each individual panel is taller than it is wide; when joined they produce the wider-proportioned scene that is characteristic of these textiles. Hunure\u2019s panels are also unusual in that he is given a title that is rarely found in this class of objects, and the title is a scribal one, while the others are exclusively those of priests.11 The lotus petal frieze, cow and mountain motif, and the style of the figures, including dress and hairstyle, indicate that these textiles date to the end of Dynasty 18.12 The third Athenaeum textile (fig. 4)13 is very different in both design and execution. It is 29.5 cm tall and 15 cm wide, excluding fringe, and the linen is of a much finer quality than those discussed above. It has a looped fringe at the top, and a plain fringe at the right side. The looped fringe presumably held a cord for suspension, and is found on several other votive textiles from Deir el-Bahri.14 The dedicatory scene is placed on the upper half of the textile, and there is no border. This arrangement is unparalleled in the other painted textiles devoted to Hathor, and is closer in its design to a cloth in the Royal Ontario Museum with a similar scene drawn in black ink.15 On the Athenaeum piece, Hathor appears in the context of a papyrus thicket. The goddess, in cow form, stands on the left upon a green-painted papyrus barque, whose curving stern ends in a papyrus umbel. The bow of the barque has unfortunately been obliterated, but in most comparable scenes, it is the bow, and not the stern, that ends in a papyrus-shaped element. The thicket is rendered as seven stems of green papyrus. The cow itself is long and lean, painted yellow with black markings. It has a sundisk between its horns, and its neck is adorned with two lotus flowers. In front of the goddess, a red stand has been placed, whose greenpainted contents are heavily damaged. A woman stands at the right, with right arm extended down, and left hand holding a censer. She is yellow-skinned, and wears a long black wig and a sheath dress. Behind her, additional offerings appear;16 they are very damaged, but are large, black objects, perhaps jars, placed on a small red base.\n11 Pinch,\nVotive Offerings to Hathor, p. 123.

Leveque\nT\nhe cloths described in the preceding article were made from medium\u2013coarse undyed linen,1 woven in an open plain weave, although one (see preceding article, fig. 3) was more finely prepared and woven.2 Unusually, the threads were two S-plyed, the reverse of traditional Egyptian techniques.3 The panels are roughly rectangular, generally wider than they are tall, but they were irregularly woven with varying widths. The three votive cloths were made in an identical manner, presumably expressly for the purpose, by a technique of construction unreported by Pinch: the cloths were woven, then turned 90\u00b0 and painted, making the warp horizontal and the weft vertical. Thus, the top of each panel represents the left side selvage of the original weaving. Technique A series of small rectangular panels were woven consecutively, each separated by a length of unwoven warps.4 The loom was either an upright frame loom, used in Egypt from the beginning of the New Kingdom,5 or the traditional ground loom, with such narrow bands, a more uncomfortable and ungainly solution for the weaver. Each panel begins and ends with 4\u20136 rows of multiple wefts (from 3 to 5 threads combined), probably to reinforce the edges. The fringe along the top edge of each panel was inlaid into the sheds of the left selvage as groups of four or five threads, which were pulled out 1 The panels had been adhered to paper backings that were then glued into the book at the\nBoston Athenaeum. Consequently, the reverse sides of the panels were not available for study. 2\nThe average thread count for figs. 1 and 2 is 13 warps/8 wefts; fig. 3 is 16 warps/ 18\u201322 wefts. 3 Rosalind Hall, Egyptian Textiles (Aylesbury, 1986), p. 12. 4 A group of two joined panels was illustrated in Pinch, Votive Offerings to Hathor, pl. 26B. 5 Hall, Egyptian Textiles, p. 15, E.J.W.

In Egypt, the inlaid fringe was always exclusively on the left side;9 as expected, there was no evidence of fringe along the bottom edge of any of the Athenaeum panels. The other fringes were merely cut warps; however, this is complicated by the fact that two of the votive cloths (above, figs. 1 and 2) were originally joined by their fringe and only cut for insertion into the bound volume at the Boston Athenaeum. This can be clearly seen by the continuation of warp threads and painted lines from one section of fringe to the next. It is apparent by the amount of paint crossing the fringes from one panel to the other that these two panels were painted while joined. The left side of one panel (above, fig. 2) had no fringe; rather, the warps were worked back into the weaving, suggesting that it may have been the first panel on the loom. The right edges of two of the panels (above, figs. 1 and 3) were bound at the fringe after weaving with a series of looping stitches. Two of the panels (above, figs. 1\u20132) were initially covered with a white ground layer, then the figures were outlined with red followed by the remainder of the colors. The third panel (above, fig. 3) does not appear to have had an overall ground layer, although some white is present below some of the colors (e.g., the black of the wig). Conclusion It is clear from the analysis that such votive cloths were woven as a series of panels that could be cut apart into one or more sections to be painted on commission or for stock supply. This technique was an efficient method of weaving a number of separate panels without having to continually rewarp a loom. It is as yet unknown how many panels were typically woven together, since two is the largest grouping yet found, but further examination of the cut warp ends of the remainder of the existing textiles should prove fruitful.\nb\n6 Barber,\nPrehistoric Textiles, pp. 151\u201352. by E.

Only an extract of suitable length on the first reign of the period in question therefore appears below. The bulk is found under the title \u201cRegnal Years and Civil Calendar in Achaemenid Egypt\u201d in The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 81 (1995), as a supplement to Gardiner\u2019s treatise on \u201cRegnal Years and Civil Calendar in Pharaonic Egypt,\u201d published half a century ago in JEA 31 (1945). But this entire investigation of Achaemenid Egyptian regnal dating is written in recognition of a man who manifests, in the way Gardiner did, a range of activity and a breadth of learning that are the envy of Egyptology\u2019s younger generation.\n1. Predating of Postdating in Achaemenid Egypt At the eve of the Persian conquest and the end of the Saite period (664\u2013 526/25 B.C.E.), regnal years were counted from one New Year\u2019s Day to the next in Egypt. Year 1 began on the day of accession and lasted until the first new year. This regnal dating system is called predating because the beginnings of the regnal years precede the beginnings of years actually reigned of the same number; years actually reigned are those counted from one anniversary of the accession to the next, beginning with the day of accession itself. The wandering year\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day roughly coincided with the beginning of the retrocalculated julian year in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.E. In the Babylonian system, adopted by the Persians, regnal years were counted from one Babylonian New Year\u2019s Day to the next, but Year 1 began on the first Babylonian new year after the accession. The period from the day of accession to the first new year was an accession year. This regnal dating system is called postdating because the beginnings of\n13 DEPUYDT Page 180 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:48 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nthe regnal years follow the beginnings of years actually reigned of the same number. The Babylonian new year always begins around the spring equinox. If Saite regnal dating is predating and Babylonian regnal dating is postdating, then Egyptian regnal dating under the Achaemenids can be 1 appropriately called predating of postdating. Year 1 had begun by the first Babylonian new year of the reign in the spring; this is the postdating element. Year 2 begins on the first Egyptian new year after that; this is the predating element. In predating of postdating, the beginnings of Egyptian regnal years either precede or follow the beginnings of real regnal years of the same number. If the king comes to the throne between the Egyptian new year and the Babylonian new year, less time is post\u2013 dated forward to the Babylonian new year than predated backward from the Babylonian new year to the Egyptian new year, and the Egyptian Year 1 ends before the first anniversary of accession, and so on for the subsequent regnal years. An example is the reign of Darius II. But if the king comes to the throne between the Babylonian new year and the Egyptian new year, more time is postdated forward than predated backward, and the Egyptian Year 1 ends after the first anniversary of accession. An example is the reign of Xerxes I. 2 Cambyses came to the throne in August 530, after the Babylonian new year in the spring and before the Egyptian new year, which fell in the beginning of January at the time. Since Cambyses (530\u2013522) did not begin his reign as ruler of Egypt, the question arises whether the same system applies in his reign as under the other Persian rulers of the Twenty-seventh Dynasty (526/5\u2013405/4). In what follows, it will be claimed that all the dates known from his reign can be reconciled with predating of postdating. There is no absolute proof, but all the relevant items will be passed in review so that the reader might be able to make an independent assessment of the plausibility of the thesis. It will also be necessary to examine the dates of the conquest and the end of Amasis\u2019 reign as well as the reigning view that two dating systems were used under Cambyses. 1 For\na more detailed description of predating of postdating, see JEA 81 (1995).

Regnal Dating under Cambyses Cambyses became king of Persia in August 530 and was still recognized in April 522, in his Babylonian Year 8, but it is not known when in 522 he died. Because his Year 7 is astronomically fixed by a lunar eclipse 3 recorded in Ptolemy\u2019s Almagest and in a Babylonian tablet, it is certain that his Babylonian Years 1 to 8 began in the evening of the following days, at first crescent visibility after a conjunction or astronomical new moon: (Year 1) 12 April 529, (2) 1 April 528, (3) 21 March 527, (4) 9 April 526, (5) 29 March 525, (6) 17 April 524, (7) 7 April 523, and (8) 27 March 4 522. It follows that his Egyptian Years 1 to 8, according to predating of postdating, would begin on the following days: (Year 1) 3 January 529, (2) 2 January 528, (3) 2 January 527, (4) 2 January 526, (5) 2 January 525, (6) 1 January 524, (7) 1 January 523, and (8) 1 January 522. References to Egyptian regnal years of Cambyses are found in 5 6 7 8 9 Demotic and hieroglyphic Egyptian. In Demotic, the Years 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 11 12 6, and 7 are attested once and Year 8 twice. In hieroglyphic 13 Egyptian, the Year 5 is attested once and Year 6 twice, once in a Sera14 15 peum stela and once in an inscription from the Wadi Hammamat. In these 11 attestations of regnal years, an important distinction should be 3\nRichard A.

Half of the dates, the Demotic year dates 2, 3, and 4, and two of the three hieroglyphic year dates, the Year 5 and the Year 6 in the Hammamat inscription, are mentioned in texts of later date. It is especially surprising to find a Year 2 attested in the same texts, in P. Cairo 50059 and in all probability in lacuna also in P. BM 10792, in which Year 8 is also mentioned. Whatever the date of Cambyses\u2019 conquest (see below), it did not occur as early as his Year 2, counting by any imaginable calendar. But since not Year 2 but rather Year 8 is the date of the document, what must have happened is that Year 2 is dated retroac16 tively and the last years of Amasis are annulled. It is unlikely that two different dating methods were used in the same manuscript. Year 2 and Year 8 are mentioned just two lines apart. There can therefore be little doubt that it was possible to date Cambyses\u2019 regnal years retroactively 17 to before the conquest. Also the Years 3 and 4 in the well-known P. Rylands IX are puzzling, for the Greek tradition (see below) claims that Cambyses became king of Egypt in his fifth year according to an unspecified calendar. For this reason, it has been suggested that the Years 3 and 4 were counted either from Amasis\u2019 death, disregarding Psammetichus III\u2019s short reign, or from 18 Cambyses\u2019 conquest of Egypt. Accordingly, the regnal dates higher than 4 could be interpreted as dating from the day of accession and there 12\nThis date is found in two complimentary documents pertaining to the same subject matter from the same archive, P.

But is it possible to interpret Years 3 and 4 simply according to predating of postdating, thus assuming a single regnal dating system for Cambyses\u2019 reign, the same as in the rest of the Persian period? To answer 20 this question, it may be useful to look at the text. (6) Psammet-kmenempe son of Hor did not come to Teujoi until now, but what he did was to send men to fetch his property, (7) until Year 44 of Amasis. In Year 3 of Cambyses, Hor son of Psammet-kmenempe, the prophet of Amun, came to (8) Teujoi, and stood with the priests\u2026 They went to (9) Psenah\u2026 and wrote him the title\u2026 in Year 4 of Cambyses.\nIt is stated how a routine followed up to Year 44 of Amasis is interrupted in Year 3 of Cambyses. The most straightforward interpretation 21 of the text is that, first, Year 44 is Amasis\u2019 last, and second, Year 3 came immediately after Amasis\u2019 Year 44. Can this be? Year 44 of Amasis has been astronomically fixed to the wandering year 2 January 527 \u2013 1 January 526 on the basis of a double date in the 22 abnormal hieratic papyrus Louvre 7848. Not only the scenario in the passage from P. Rylands IX above, but also two passages in one of the texts on the verso of BN 215, whose recto contains the so-called Demotic Chronicle, lead one to believe that Year 44 was Amasis\u2019 last. The text on the verso of BN 215, which deals with the compiling of laws in the reign of Darius I, speaks of the matters \u201cwhich were written in the wt\u2013book starting with Year 44 of Pharaoh Amasis up to the day on which Cambyses became lord of Egypt,\u201d and a few lines later in the text, Darius is said to order the priests to \u201cwrite the earlier law of Egypt up to 23 Year 44 of Amasis.\u201d If Year 44 is Amasis\u2019 last, the rest of the wandering year 2 January 527 \u2013 1 January 526 would be a regnal year of another king. In fact, according to the predating of postdating system, Year 3 of Cambyses coincides with the same wandering year, so that the portion of the wan24 dering year after Amasis\u2019 death could be called Cambyses\u2019 Year 3. In this sense, Year 44 of Amasis and Year 3 of Cambyses follow one another immediately within the same wandering year. Any other interpretations 18 For\nthe first alternative, see Griffith, Catalogue, vol. 3, p. 106, and Parker, \u201cPersian and Egyptian Chronology,\u201d p. 301 with n. 41. Parker later noted that counting from the conquest, instead of from Amasis\u2019 death, cannot be excluded as a possibility (\u201cThe Length of Reign of Amasis,\u201d pp. 209\u201310 n. 3 end). 19 See Parker, \u201cPersian and Egyptian Chronology,\u201d p. 301; \u201cThe Length of Reign of Amasis,\u201d pp. 209\u201310 n. 3; Pestman, \u201cThe Diospolis Parva Documents,\u201d p. 154. 20 P.\nRylands IX 21,6\u20139 (after Griffith, Catalogue, vol. 3, 105).

Cairo 50059. It must also mean that Psammetichus III\u2019s reign was disregarded. Here, a parallel can be adduced: Psammetichus\u2019 reign is ignored in the expression from BN 215 quoted above, \u201cstarting with Year 44 of Pharaoh Amasis up to the day on which Cambyses became lord of Egypt.\u201d This formulation suggests that there was an interval of some length between the two dates. Since it appears Amasis died in his Year 44, Psammetichus III would have reigned in this interval. The identification of the Demotic year dates 3 and 4 with julian years proposed above seems rather effortless. It explains the sequence of events in P. Rylands IX, agrees with regnal dating throughout the Twenty-seventh Dynasty and also has the advantage of assuming only a single dating method in Cambyses\u2019 reign instead of the traditional two: 23\nParis BN 215, verso, column C, lines 6\u20137 and 10\u201311. For transcription and translation, see Wilhelm Spiegelberg, Die sogenannte Demotische Chronik des Pap. 215 der Biblioth\u00e8que nationale zu Paris nebst den auf der R\u00fcckseite des Papyrus stehenden Texten (Leipzig, 1914), pp. 30\u201331. Parker notes that, in BN 215, \u201cthere is twice mention of Year 44 of Amasis as some sort of terminal point\u201d (\u201cThe Length of Reign of Amasis,\u201d p. 210 top), but he doubts the reading of the year dates. These doubts seem to have come about as follows. Before Parker\u2019s discovery of the lunar date in Louvre 7848, it had been common to think that Amasis died in his Year 44 and begun his reign in 569. But Parker\u2019s correct interpretation of the lunar date established that Amasis\u2019 reign began a year earlier in 570. Consequently, retaining Year 44 as Amasis\u2019 last would increase the distance between the end of his reign and the Persian conquest, generally thought to have happened in 525, by a whole year. To keep the end of Amasis\u2019 reign close to the conquest in 525, Parker proposed that Amasis died in his Year 45, though the evidence from the Chronicle, if the number is read \u201c44,\u201d as well as that from P. Rylands IX, points to Year 44 as Amasis\u2019 last, as Parker acknowledges. In other words, the perception that \u201c44,\u201d as number of the last regnal year, contradicts the astronomical evidence, always the best in chronological matters, may have motivated Parker\u2019s doubts on the reading of the number. But now that 525 has itself become uncertain as a date for the conquest (see below), an opportunity is created to reconcile the firm astronomical evidence with the obvious interpretation of Year 44 as Amasis\u2019 last. Recently, Pestman has read \u201c44\u201d in BN 215, verso, column C, 6\u20137 (\u201cThe Diospolis Parva Documents,\u201d p. 149). It seems one can recognize the Demotic numbers 40 and 4 in both instances, and this reading is confirmed by Janet Johnson, who was able to manipulate a scanned photograph of the text with the help of computer graphics (personal communication). 24 Barta\u2019s discussion of the date of the Persian conquest is based on the assumption that Year 44 of Amasis and Year of Darius 3 cannot be identical (Datierungspraxis, p. 88 bottom). 25 Parker,\n\u201cThe Length of Reign of Amasis,\u201d p. 209. was suggested as a possibility that he was, though, by Gauthier (Livre des rois, vol. 4, p. 137 n. 1), who realizes that it contradicts the Greek evidence (see below). 26 It\n184\n13 DEPUYDT Page 185 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:48 PM\nLeo Depuydt, Egyptian Regnal Dating under Cambyses and the Date of the Persian Conquest\none might expect Demotic scribal tradition to have settled on a single dating method. If only one dating system was used, P. Rylands IX confirms predating of postdating. It is not clear how such a system came about in the middle of Cambyses\u2019 reign, when he conquered Egypt. Chronological evidence often arises from being able to place events in some kind of numerical relation with one other. In this respect, one 27 item still deserves mention. According to stela Louvre IM.4187, Apis XLIV (Mariette\u2019s number) was born on Month 5 Day 29 of Year 5 of 28 Cambyses, died on Month 9 Day 4 of Year 4 of Darius I, and was buried 29 on Month 11 Day 13 in the same year. The traditional julian dates for these three events are 29 May 525, 31 August 518, and 8 November 30 518. What is more, the time between birth and death of the bull is given as 7 or 8 years, 3 months, and 5 days. Paleographically, the year date may be either 7 or 8; there are eight strokes, but one is not as evenly 31 spaced as the others. If both Year 5 of Cambyses and Year 4 of Darius are interpreted as predating of postdating, then 7 should be the correct reading. Since Year 4 of Darius I can hardly be later than 518 by any regnal dating system, the only way to justify 8 would be if Year 5 of Cambyses was obtained by predating and not by predating of postdating. At all events, the problem with the reading of the year date makes the 32 stela inconclusive as evidence. 3. The Date of the Persian Conquest A Babylonian document dated to 22 Kislev of Year 6 of Cambyses, that is, 31 December 524, and dealing with the sale of an Egyptian slave woman said to be part of war booty, provides a reliable terminus ante\n27 Posener,\nLa premi\u00e8re domination, pp. 36\u201341. The day date is damaged, but the full date is also found in Louvre 355 and Louvre 366 (call numbers according to Posener, La premi\u00e8re domination, p. 38). 29 This date is also recorded in Louvre 319 and 320 (call numbers according to Posener 1936, La premi\u00e8re domination, p. 39). 30 The previous bull died on Month 11 Day [10?] of Year 6 of Cambyses according to Louvre IM.4133; the reading of the day date is uncertain; \u201c10\u201d has been suggested by Posener ( La premi\u00e8re domination, p. 32). This means that there is a most unusual gap of a year and a half between the birth of Apis xliv and the burial of its predecessor. For different explanations of this much discussed gap, see my \u201cEvidence for Accession Dating under the Achaemenids,\u201d JAOS (forthcoming). This gap might be connected with the incident of Cambyses\u2019 wounding the Apis, or perhaps even be relevant to the chronology of the period, but I cannot quite see how at this point; on the Apis murder case, see \u201cMurder in Memphis: The Story of Cambyses\u2019 Mortal Wounding of the Apis (ca. 523 b.c.e.),\u201d JNES 54 (1995), pp. 119\u201326. 28\n31 For\na discussion, see Parker, \u201cEgyptian and Persian Chronology,\u201d pp. 286\u201387. p. 287.\n32 Ibid.,\n185\n13 DEPUYDT Page 186 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:48 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\n33\nquem. It seems the Egyptian campaign should have taken place 34 several months before that date. The terminus ante quem can be moved back to June 15 of 525 by 35 means of P. Cairo 50060. This papyrus contains a list of dates in Year 5 of Cambyses. As it is difficult to imagine a calendar system in which Year 5 would correspond to a wandering year later than that of 2 January \u2013 31 December 525, the earliest date in the list of dates, II prt [1?]6 and 36 20 should be dated [1?]5 and 19 June 525 at the latest. A terminus post quem for the conquest is obtained from the fact that Amasis died at the earliest in his Year 44, the wandering year 2 January 527 \u2013 1 January 526. It has been suggested above that 527 was Amasis\u2019 last. But no month and day dates have surfaced for year 44 to 37 determine the date of death of Amasis more precisely. Meanwhile, it can be concluded that the conquest began at the earliest in the year 527. Any fine-tuning depends on a discussion of the Greek evidence, which follows below. Independently from these considerations of the terminus ante quem and the terminus post quem, the traditional date of the conquest has now for quite some time been the spring of 525. This date was obtained 38 by a clever combination of Greek and Demotic sources. On the one hand, Greek sources report that: (1) Cambyses undertook a campaign against Egypt in the third year of 39 the sixty-third Olympiad (Diodorus ) (2) Cambyses became king of Egypt in the fifth year of his reign over the 33\nBruno Meissner, \u201cDas Datum der Einnahme \u00c4gyptens durch Cambyses,\u201d Z\u00c4S 29 (1891), pp. 123\u201324.

The soldier, if the child was his, would have been in Egypt a year before in December 525, as Meissner already implied. 35\nThe date Month 5 Day 29 of Year 5 of Cambyses (29 May 525), found in stela Louvre IM.4187, is not contemporary with the text in which it is found, and could therefore have been dated retroactively. 36 The complete list is as follows: II prt [1?]6, 20, 22 of Cambyses\u2019 Year 5; IV prt 24, 26, 27, 28, 29; I \u00dfmw 1, 2, 12, 13, 14, 16, [1]7. In 525, these dates would be as follows: [1?]5, 19, 21 June; 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30 August; 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 September. 37 The Hammamat inscription of Year 44 does not have one (Gauthier, Livre des rois, vol. 4, p. 120 with n. 2). 38 Cf.

Two papyri are dated to Year 2 of a king called Psammetichus, one in Month 5; in a third papyrus, dated to the 42 same king, \u201c2\u201d for the year date is a plausible reading. These Greek and Demotic sources were reconciled as follows. Psammetichus III can only reign six months and have a second year into its fifth month if he came to the throne at the end of one wandering year and ruled into the fifth month of the next and not much beyond that. The report that Cambyses became king in the fifth year of his reign (Manetho), which began at the earliest in August 526, allows one to identify the two wandering years in question with 2 Jan 526 \u2013 1 Jan 525 and 2 Jan 525 \u20131 Jan 524. In the second, Month 5 corresponds to 1 \u2013 30 May. Around this time, then, traditional chronology dates Cambyses\u2019 conquest. It is not contradicted by the terminus ante quem of [1?]5 June 525 mentioned above. But recently, the three Demotic documents dating to king Psammetichus have been discredited as evidence because they have been redated about thirty years later and a rebel Pharaoh Psammetichus IV has been postulated for the tumultuous period after the death of Darius I late in 43 486. What is left, then, as evidence is the Greek tradition, already listed above. This evidence is not contemporary and great caution always needs to be exercised with dates provided by Greek historians for earlier antiquity, certainly when it comes to establishing the exact year in which an event occurred. Nevertheless, an attempt will be made to interpret the Greek evidence in light of the contemporary evidence. 40 Kambuvsh\" e[tei e, th'\" eJautou' basileiva\" Persw'n ejbasivleusen Aijguvptou (version of Eusebius, through Syncellus) \u201cCambyses became king of Egypt in the fifth year of his reign over the Persians\u201d (W.G.

Pharaoh Psammetichus IV was first postulated by Eugene Cruz-Uribe, \u201cOn the Existence of Psammetichus IV,\u201d Serapis 5.2 (1980), pp. 35\u201339.\n187\n13 DEPUYDT Page 188 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:48 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nInterestingly, Diodorus notes that Cambyses began his Egyptian campaign at the death of Amasis and he dates this development to the third year of the sixty-third Olympiad, but he does not mention Psammetichus III. As mentioned earlier, the Demotic evidence suggests that Amasis died in 527. Can the information provided by Diodorus be reconciled with this date? The Olympic Games referred to by Diodorus are the ones held in 528, and one may assume that they took place in late summer, in August 44 or September. If one counts the games themselves as the beginning of the Olympiad\u2019s first year, the third year would begin in August or September of 526, at least several months after the date of death of Amasis derived from the Demotic sources. But several calendars were used in the Greek world, and as a result of the synchronizing of different calendars, among one another and with the Olympiads, different ways of 45 counting came into use. One of them is from fall to fall, as in the Macedonian calendar. Accordingly, the first year of the sixty-third Olympiad would last from fall 529 to fall 528 and the third year from fall 527 to fall 526. Such a dating for Cambyses\u2019 campaign would agree better with the Demotic evidence, if it is assumed that Diodorus is correct in dating the beginning of the campaign soon after Amasis\u2019 death. The Greek chronographic tradition is complex and the competence of the present writer in these matters is not such as to warrant a defini46 tive statement. But at least Diodorus\u2019 statement does not have to mean that Cambyses\u2019 campaign had to occur in 526/25, the common equivalent for Olympiad 63,3. Much depends on the chronographer or epitomator from whom Diodorus was excerpting for his account of the late sixth century. It may well never be possible to determine the circumstances under which the event came to be associated with the third year of the sixty-third Olympiad in Diodorus\u2019 much later account. Manetho states that Cambyses became king in his fifth year. Since Cambyses came to the throne in August 530, this would be the year beginning in August 526. In comparing Diodorus and Manetho, it should be noted that the former states that Cambyses \u201cundertook a military campaign\u201d (ejstravteusen), the latter that Cambyses \u201cbecame king\u201d (ejbasivleusen). 44\nFriedrich Karl Ginzel, Handbuch der technischen und mathematischen Chronologie, vol. 2 (Leipzig, 1911), pp. 354\u201356. 45 Ginzel, Handbuch, vol. 2, pp. 356\u201358. On Olympiads, see also E.J. Bickerman, Chronology of the Ancient World (London, 1968), pp. 75\u201376, 91. 46 On the chronographic tradition, see, for example, Alden E.

What is a reasonable dating range for Cambyses\u2019 conquest of Egypt? This depends in part on the definition of \u201cconquest.\u201d But if taken as the whole development, from mounting the military campaign in Persia and Mesopotamia to the crowning of Cambyses, the period from 527\u2013beginning of June 525 seems certain\u2014no later than 15 June 525, in accordance with the terminus post quem established above, and not earlier than early 527, the earliest date for Amasis\u2019 death; Diodorus states that Cambyses began his campaign around the time of Amasis\u2019 death. The campaign could have begun later than 527 or the conquest have been completed several months before June 525. As in the case of the Arab conquest of Egypt around 640 C.E., it could have taken many months. It is not possible to determine exactly when Egyptian forces capitulated or when Cambyses was crowned. For the dating of these events, it is necessary to take into account Psammetichus III\u2019s short reign after Amasis\u2019 death. The earliest date for the end of Psammetichus\u2019 reign would be several months after Amasis\u2019 death in 527, that is mid to late 527. The Greek evidence suggests that Cambyses\u2019 crowning was later in 526/25. Later than 527 is also suggested by the consideration that the campaign must have had some extension in time. It may be concluded that, if one wishes to use only year dates to refer to the date of the conquest, the years 527\u201325 seem safe limits for the time being. Regnal Years of Cambyses according to the Egyptian Calendar \u2022 Each regnal year is precisely 365 days long, except for (1) the \u201cbeginning (of the reign),\u201d a period named so for lack of knowledge how the Egyptians called it, lasting from the day of accession to the first Babylonian new year; (2) the first regnal year, lasting from the first Babylonian new year to the first Egyptian new year after that\u2014that is, the first or second Egyptian new year of the reign, depending on when the king came to the throne; (3) the last regnal year, lasting from the last Egyptian new year of the reign to the death of the king. 47\nPsammetichus (III) is mentioned as successor of Amasis in the well-known statue inscription of Udjahorresne (Posener, La premi\u00e8re domination, pp. 1\u201326).\n189\n13 DEPUYDT Page 190 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:48 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\n\u2022 Wandering years marked in italics, be they complete or incomplete, include a julian 29 February.

Dates containing this regnal year can only be retroactive, since Cambyses\u2019 conquest took place in the period from early 527 at the earliest to mid 525 at the latest. The \u201cbeginning (of the reign)\u201d(?) and Year 1 are not attested as retroactive dates, Year 2 in all probability is found in P. Cairo 50059. c\nd\nThis is 1 Nisan or the Babylonian new year. For this date, see Parker and Dubberstein, Babylonian Chronology, p. 30; for the degree of accuracy of this date, see ibid., p. 25. e Dates containing this regnal year probably could only occur in documents by using retroactive dating. But since Cambyses\u2019 conquest began in early 527 at the earliest and ended in early June 525 at the latest, the probability of encountering real dates increases as this period progresses. Year 3 and Year 4 are attested in P.Ryl. IX and are probably retroactive dates. Month 5 Day 29 of Year 5 found in Louvre IM.4187 occurs in a stela from Year 4 of Darius and could therefore be a retroactive date; if it is not, the terminus ante quem for the conquest would be 29 May 525. f Dates in the earlier part of this year could be retroactive if mentioned in documents of later date, for the terminus ante quem for Cambyses\u2019 conquest is June 525. g Cambyses was still recognized according to the Babylonian records in April 522. The Behistun inscription indicates that he did not die till after 1 July 522.

Il est un fait, ces deux animaux femelles, l\u2019une du domaine de l\u2019air, l\u2019autre voisine du mar\u00e9cage, vautour et cobra, ne figurent pas seulement dans le protocole, mais, dissoci\u00e9es ou \u00e0 nouveau r\u00e9unies, on les trouve pr\u00e8s de Pharaon vivant ou bien encore apr\u00e8s son tr\u00e9pas. Seule, on le sait, l\u2019ur\u00e6us figure au front du roi de son vivant, alors qu\u2019au dessus de lui le vautour \u00e9tend ses ailes protectrices.3 En revanche, sur les enveloppes de la momie royale, ainsi que les objets du tr\u00e9sor de Tout-\u00e2nkh-Amon nous ont permis de le constater, on retrouve sur les divers sarcophages, les chaouabtis (fig. 3), ou les bouchons de vases canopes (fig. 4) les deux animaux r\u00e9unis, montrant en cela que, pour la reconstitution du mort, les deux D\u00e9esses Tut\u00e9laires \u00e9taient assur\u00e9ment n\u00e9cessaires. Cette n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 est si imp\u00e9rieuse que m\u00eame les dais fun\u00e9raires successifs (fig. 5), enfermant les divers sarcophages momiformes embo\u00eet\u00e9s, rappellent par leurs formes le profil des chapelles du Sud et du Nord, habitats respectifs, d\u00e8s les Hautes Epoques, de nos deux d\u00e9esses.

Enfin il est n\u00e9cessaire de consid\u00e9rer avec attention le tableau, tr\u00e8s longtemps rest\u00e9 inaccessible, dans le couloir menant au mammisi de Philae.15 Sur deux registres, la renaissance du dieu (et le renouveau de Pharaon) sont \u00e9voqu\u00e9s. Au registre inf\u00e9rieur le mar\u00e9cage compos\u00e9 de \u201clis\u201d et de papyrus est habit\u00e9 par le d\u00e9doublement de la vache Hathor nourrici\u00e8re.16 Puis apparaissent, au dessus de deux bassins d\u2019o\u00f9 surgissent deux lotus, les deux I\u00a2y, joueurs de sistres. Ainsi donc, les deux plantes r\u00e9sident dans le domaine chthonien o\u00f9 se reconstitue le dieu mort en tant que futur Horus.

II. The Valley Temple (Cairo, 1961). In diesem Tempel befanden sich 10 monolithe Pfeiler, deren Lage in dem Grundri\u00dfplan auf S. 2 bei Fakhry gut zu sehen ist. Den Ausgr\u00e4bern bot sich wie sonst auch bei diesen Pfeilern ein chaotisches Bild. Alle 10 Pfeiler waren zur Steingewinnung schon in alter Zeit umgelegt und die gr\u00f6\u00dferen Steine abtransportiert worden. Zumindest ein Teil der Pfeiler trug Reliefs und Inschriften; die R\u00fcckseite der Pfeiler, also ihre Nordseite, trug keine Reliefs. Ansonsten konnten die Vorderseiten (also die S\u00fcdseiten) sowie die Ost- und Westseiten reliefiert sein. Alle Reliefsplitter lagen so chaotisch im Schutt des Tempels umher, da\u00df es f\u00fcr Fakhry unm\u00f6glich war, einzelne Reliefs einzelnen Pfeilern zuzuweisen. Die 10 Pfeiler waren in F\u00fcnferreihen hintereinander angeordnet. Zu den Ausmessungen der Pfeiler teilt Fakhry Folgendes mit: \u201ctheir breadth varied between 185 and 210 cms, but their depth was 120 cms in the five pillars of the front row and 140 cms in the pillars of the back row.\u201d Daraus ergibt sich doch wohl, da\u00df die Pfeilerquerschnitte der Frontreihe, die dem von S\u00fcden Eintretenden am n\u00e4chsten lag, etwas kleiner waren als die der r\u00fcckw\u00e4rtigen Pfeilerreihe. Wir m\u00fcssen also die Pfeilerbreiten von 185 und 210 cm entsprechend auf die Pfeiler der r\u00fcckw\u00e4rtigen Reihe (210 cm) bzw. der Frontreihe (185 cm) verteilen, obwohl dies Fakhry nicht ausdr\u00fccklich angibt. Der Grundri\u00df des Tempels auf S. 2 l\u00e4\u00dft auch nur erkennen, da\u00df die Frontseiten breiter sind als die Ostund Westseiten der Pfeiler. Infolge des kleinen Ma\u00dfstabs lassen sich aber keine genauen Nachmessungen im mm-Bereich durchf\u00fchren. Eine \u00dcbersicht \u00fcber die Ma\u00dfe s\u00e4he so aus:\n15 EDEL Page 200 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:50 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nBreite der Hintere Pfeilerreihe im Norden:\nOst- bzw. Westseite 140 cm Frontseite 210 cm\nVordere Pfeilerreihe im S\u00fcden:\nOst- bzw. Westseite 120 cm Frontseite 185 cm\nWir kommen auf diese Ma\u00dfangaben noch einmal zur\u00fcck und erw\u00e4hnen hier nur noch, da\u00df die Einzelzeichnungen der Reliefs bei Fakhry im Ma\u00dfstab 1:6 gegeben werden (vgl. S. 62), w\u00e4hrend f\u00fcr die aus diesen Einzelfragmenten gewonnenen Rekonstruktionszeichnungen bei Fakhry leider Ma\u00dfangaben fehlen. 1. Fakhrys Pfeilerseite C 2 (unsere Abb. 1) Die beiden mehr oder weniger gut erhaltenen Pfeilerseiten, die Fakhry C 1 (seine Fig. 58 auf S. 77) bzw. C 2 (seine Fig. 63 auf S. 80, unsere Abb. 1) nennt, schlie\u00dfen \u00fcber die Eckkante aneinander an. C 1 ist die Frontseite, C 2 die Ostseite nach Fakhry S. 77. Nur \u00fcber C 2, das wir in Abb. 1 vervollst\u00e4ndigt haben, ist hier zu sprechen. Zu Fig. 63 gibt es ein wichtiges gro\u00dfes Zusatzst\u00fcck, Fig. 64 auf Fakhrys S. 81, dessen Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit zu Fig. 63 von Fakhry zu sp\u00e4t erkannt wurde, so da\u00df es nicht in Fig. 63 zur Anschauung kommt. Ich habe Fig. 64\u201367 im gleichen Ma\u00dfstab wie bei Fakhry (also 1:6) zeichnen lassen, um sie genauer zusammenf\u00fcgen zu k\u00f6nnen, als dies in Fakhrys Rekonstruktionszeichnung Fig. 63 der Fall ist. Dazu konnte ich noch die von Fakhry v\u00f6llig isoliert gebrachte Fig. 246 (Fakhry S. 161) in die vor dem Bild des K\u00f6nigs verlaufende senkrechte Zeile einzeichnen lassen. Man beachte dabei den etwas schr\u00e4g zur Hieroglyphe w\u00a3\u2202 verlaufenden Teil des k\u00f6niglichen Stabes, der genau die leichte Schr\u00e4ge des von Snofru gehaltenen Stabes weiterf\u00fchrt und somit beweisend ist f\u00fcr die Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit von Fig. 246 zu Fig. 63 und 67. Fakhry hatte nur die Figur des K\u00f6nigs etwas erg\u00e4nzen lassen. Titel und Namen des Snofru auf diesem Relief hat bereits Fakhry besprochen. Nachzutragen w\u00e4re aber, da\u00df \u00fcber dem \u201cGold\u201dtitel noch wie in Fig. 48 (Fakhry S. 71) n\u2020r \u2122\u00a3 \u201cder gro\u00dfe Gott\u201d gestanden haben k\u00f6nnte. Die senkrechte Inschriftzeile beginnt mit dem Infinitiv m\u00a3\u00a3 \u201csehen, betrachten, inspizieren,\u201d wobei Fakhrys Zeichner in Fig. 63 das Auge rechts von der m\u00a3-Sichel vergessen hat, das aber in der Einzelzeichnung 1:6 in Fig. 66 v\u00f6llig deutlich dasteht. Von m\u00a3\u00a3 ist abh\u00e4ngig jrd \u2122\u00df w\u00a3\u2202 (zusehen) \u201cwie die frische Pinie w\u00e4chst.\u201d Zu jrd mit j-Augment hat Fakhry auf S. 85, Anm. 1, meinen ihm damals in Kairo gegebenen Hinweis auf Urk.

Junker, Giza III, 181 und 209; es begegnet auch in den Jahreszeitenreliefs des Niuserre, vgl. meine Arbeit in den NAWG 1961,8 Abb. 13 mit S. 251. Von den beiden als Subjekte zu rd \u201cwachsen\u201d hier genannten B\u00e4umen scheint der \u2122\u00df-Baum nur im Singular genannt zu werden, w\u00e4hrend die \u2122(n)tjw-B\u00e4ume im Plural stehen. Zur Schreibung von \u2122\u00df mit drei nw-Kr\u00fcgen vgl. man den Erkl\u00e4rungsversuch von Sethe in Z\u00c4S 45 (1908), 11. Noch \u00e4lter ist die Schreibung von \u2122\u00df mit drei nw-Kr\u00fcgen im Grab des Hesire aus dem Anfang der 3. Dynastie belegt, vgl. Altenm\u00fcller, SAK (1976), 16, Abb. 4. Bemerkenswert ist die Schreibung von \u2122(n)tjw gleich aus mehreren Gr\u00fcnden. Das n ist in der Schreibung unterdr\u00fcckt worden genau wie in der 6. Dynastie in der Inschrift des Sabni, Urk. I, 139,13. Das Determinativ sollte ein Krug mit Handgriffen sein wie Gardiner, Signlist W 23 (\u201cjar with handles\u201d); so deutlich sichtbar bei \u2122ntjw Junker, Giza III, 171, Abb. 30. Bei uns liegt dagegen ganz klar das Zeichen f\u00fcr jb \u201cHerz\u201d vor, das genau dem Zeichen f\u00fcr jb in dem Namen Mrj-jb gleicht: Junker, Giza III, S. 169, Abb. 30. Zu beachten ist auch, was Lacau dazu sagt in Les Noms des Parties du Corps, Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et de Belles Lettres (Paris 1970), S. 91 in dem Abschnitt \u00fcber das Herz: \u201cIl semble que la figure de l\u2019organe ait abouti, et cela d\u00e8s les Textes des Pyramides, \u00e0 celle d\u2019un vase. Y a-t-il jamais eu un vase de cette m\u00eame forme et de ce m\u00eame nom?\u201d Die Erkl\u00e4rung d\u00fcrfte aber viel einfacher sein: Da die Zeichen f\u00fcr \u201cHerz\u201d und f\u00fcr W 23 im Hieratischen so gut wie identisch waren, wurden sie auch im Hieroglyphischen wohl laufend verwechselt; vgl. dazu unsere Abb. 2, wo unter M zu verstehen ist M\u00f6ller, Hieratische Pal\u00e4ographie. Da der verf\u00fcgbare Platz gut ausreicht, m\u00fcssen unter \u2122(n)tjw noch drei K\u00f6rner als Determinativ erg\u00e4nzt werden wie in Pyr. 512b, wo au\u00dferdem noch das Gef\u00e4\u00df W 23 als Determinativ erscheint, das bei uns durch das \u201cHerz\u201d ersetzt wird.\nAbb. 2. Verwechslung von Hieroglyphen bedingt durch die hieratischen Zeichenformen.\nDie drei Baumhieroglyphen\u2014zwei davon erg\u00e4nzt\u2014die hinter \u2122(n)tjw \u201cMyrrhen\u201d stehen, sind nun nicht etwa als Determinativa zu \u2122(n)tjw aufzufassen. Sie sind vielmehr als ideographische Schreibung f\u00fcr den\n202\n15 EDEL Page 203 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:50 PM\nElmar Edel, Studien zu den Relieffragmenten aus dem Taltempel des K\u00f6nigs Snofru\nPlural nhwt \u201cB\u00e4ume\u201d anzusehen. Urk. IV, 329,4 (Bericht der Hatschepsut \u00fcber die bekannte Puntexpedition) zeigt, wie wir den Text bei Snofru zu verstehen haben, wobei wir die Baumhieroglyphe durch B und das \u201cKorn\u201d durch K symbolisieren: nhwtBBB nt \u2122(n)tjwKKK w\u00a3\u2202 \u201cB\u00e4ume mit frischen Myrrhen\u201d (Hochstellung B und K weist auf den Gebrauch dieser Zeichen als Determinative hin). Bei Snofru ist bis auf w\u00a3\u2202 \u201cfrisch\u201d nach Art des Kanzleistils alles umgestellt worden, wie ich das in Alt\u00e4g. Gramm. \u00a7\u00a7 310\u2013314 beschrieben und durch Beispiele belegt habe. Zum Kanzleistil geh\u00f6rt auch, wie bei uns, die Weglassung des Genetivexponenten nj/nt. Wie unnat\u00fcrlich durch den Kanzleistil die Wortstellung umgeordnet wurde, zeigt sich gut an der Stellung des w\u00a3\u2202, das nicht zu nhwt gezogen werden darf, sondern wie sonst stets die \u2122(n)tjw als \u201cfrisch\u201d bezeichnet, vgl. Urk. IV, 346,14; 706,11. Ob \u2122ntjw wirklich \u201cMyrrhen\u201d bezeichnet, ist offen. Vgl. Germer, Flora des pharaonischen \u00c4gypten (Mainz, 1985), S. 107 (\u201cmit gr\u00f6\u00dfter Wahrscheinlichkeit\u2026 Myrrhe-harz\u201d), w\u00e4hrend Loret, Kemi 12 (1952), 17/18, \u2122ntjw\u2014f\u00fcr mich wahrscheinlicher\u2014f\u00fcr das wohlriechende Olibanum h\u00e4lt, das von Boswellia Arten gewonnen wird. Was schlie\u00dflich die botanische Bestimmung des \u2122\u00df-Baums angeht, so hat Loret, ASAE 16 (1916), 33 ff., gezeigt, da\u00df das Wort sowohl die Tanne (Abies cilicica) wie auch die Pinie (Pinus pinea) bezeichnen konnte. Im ersten Fall habe man gerne die Bezeichnung \u2122\u00df m\u00a3\u2122 \u201cechter \u2122\u00df-Baum\u201d gew\u00e4hlt, im anderen Fall habe man sich mit der Bezeichnung \u2122\u00df allein begn\u00fcgt. Nun ist erstmalig durch eine Inschrift des Snofru-Tempels (Fig. 110, siehe im Folgenden Abb. 3) belegt, da\u00df der \u2122\u00df-Baum e\u00dfbare Fr\u00fcchte (pr-t \u2122\u00df) trug. Das ist bei den Koniferen nur bei der Pinie der Fall, womit die botanische Bestimmung des \u2122\u00df-Baums eindeutig gesichert ist. Die \u00dcbersetzung der Inschrift von C 2 lautet nun: \u201cSchauen, wie die frische Pinie (und) die B\u00e4ume mit frischen Myrrhen(?) wachsen.\u201d Es ist klar, da\u00df der K\u00f6nig, dem diese Beischrift gilt, die genannten B\u00e4ume auch optisch vor sich gehabt haben mu\u00df. Die schmale Pfeilerseite gestattet nat\u00fcrlich nicht, eine Baumlandschaft vor dem K\u00f6nig bildlich auszubreiten. Daf\u00fcr aber hat man die M\u00f6glichkeit benutzt, unter den hochgestellten rechteckigen Darstellungen jeweils ein flachliegendes Rechteck anzubringen, um den Bildinhalt der gro\u00dfen Darstellungen, wenn auch in sehr viel kleinerem Ma\u00dfstab, zu erg\u00e4nzen. In Fig. 43 und 110 (bei Fakhry S. 84 und 106, letzteres bei uns als Abb. 3) kann man zumindest die Reste solcher erg\u00e4nzenden Darstellungen beobachten. Da ist nun Fig. 275 mit der Darstellung eines Baumes in der rechten Bildecke, dem nach links weitere B\u00e4ume gefolgt sein k\u00f6nnen, von gr\u00f6\u00dftem Interesse, zumal wenn man dazu die Beschreibung h\u00e4lt, die\n203\n15 EDEL Page 204 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:50 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nFakhry auf S. 165 von dem Baum gibt: \u201cAn unusual relief which shows the leaves of a large tree; no similar representation is known to have existed in any temple of the O.K.\u201d Wie aus unserer Zeichnung hervorgeht, pa\u00dft der Baum bequem in den durch Fig. 110 vorgegebenen rechteckigen Rahmen. Die ungew\u00f6hnliche Baumdarstellung, die Fakhry so auffiel, pa\u00dft nun aufs beste dazu, da\u00df der K\u00f6nig laut Beischrift auf exotische, in \u00c4gypten sonst nicht vorkommende Myrrhenb\u00e4ume blickt. Wir m\u00fcssen gedanklich die Baum- bzw. B\u00e4umedarstellung nach links und in Augenh\u00f6he des K\u00f6nigs r\u00fccken, um den Bildinhalt des Ganzen voll aussch\u00f6pfen zu k\u00f6nnen. Zu den Ma\u00dfen der Darstellung ist noch Folgendes nachzutragen: Die Zeichnung wurde zun\u00e4chst nach den Zeichnungen der einzelnen Bestandteile in dem von Fakhry vorgegebenen Ma\u00dfstab 1:6 hergestellt und erg\u00e4nzt. Die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe des K\u00f6nigs betrug dann von den F\u00fc\u00dfen bis zur Sch\u00e4deldecke 29,7 cm, so da\u00df das Original die sechsfache Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, also 1,78 m, aufgewiesen haben mu\u00df. Von den F\u00fc\u00dfen bis zum obersten Federnabschlu\u00df auf der Krone ma\u00dfen wir 37,4 cm, was einer originalen Gr\u00f6\u00dfe des erg\u00e4nzten Reliefs von 2,24 m entspricht. F\u00fcr die ungef\u00e4hre Lokalisation des Pfeilers ist nun aber entscheidend die Pfeilerbreite. Wenn wir hinter dem K\u00f6nig nichts weiter erg\u00e4nzen, kommt man schon auf eine Pfeilerbreite von 23,6 x 6 cm = 139,8 cm. Das entspricht genau den 140 cm, die Fakhry f\u00fcr die Ost- bzw. Westseiten der hinteren (s\u00fcdlichen) Pfeilerreihe angibt, wie wir bereits sahen. 2. Fakhrys Pfeilerseite C 1 Die Seite C 1 ist bei Fakhry als Fig. 58 auf S. 78 abgebildet. Wir k\u00f6nnen sie nicht weiter erg\u00e4nzen und verzichten daher auf ihre Wiedergabe. Ihre Breite w\u00e4re 210 cm, da es sich um die Frontseite eines Pfeilers der hinteren Pfeilerreihe handelt, wie wir im Vorstehenden sahen. Das schlecht erhaltene Relief zeigt den K\u00f6nig nach links laufend. Vgl. dazu den Kommentar bei Fakhry S. 77 und 80. 3. Fakhrys Fig. 110 (unsere Abb. 3) Man k\u00f6nnte dieses Relief, dessen Erg\u00e4nzung wir als Abb. 3 wiedergeben, auch als *C 3 bezeichnen, da es sehr wahrscheinlich als Gegenst\u00fcck zu C 2 angesehen werden darf, und dazu w\u00fcrde passen, da\u00df der K\u00f6nig genau wie auf der gegen\u00fcberliegenden Pfeilerseite C 2 nach rechts schreitet mit Blickrichtung auf die Kapellen im Nordteil des Taltempels. W\u00e4hrend in dem hochgestellten Rechteck der K\u00f6nig dargestellt ist, sind in dem unteren liegenden Rechteck f\u00fcnf Genien dargestellt, die dem K\u00f6nig ein \u201cGottesopfer darbringen,\u201d wenn man sich die Darstellung\n204\n15 EDEL Page 205 Thursday, July 22, 2004 12:50 PM\nElmar Edel, Studien zu den Relieffragmenten aus dem Taltempel des K\u00f6nigs Snofru\nAbb. 3.

Zwei Genien sind praktisch erhalten, w\u00e4hrend sich die Erg\u00e4nzung der \u00fcbrigen drei Genien problemlos in die durch C 2 vorgegebene Breite des Rechtecks einf\u00fcgt. So wie in C 2 die Pinie als erster Baum in der senkrechten Inschriftzeile vor dem K\u00f6nig genannt wird, so werden auch die \u201cFr\u00fcchte der Pinie\u201d von dem ersten in Abb. 3 dargestellten Genius dargebracht. Das d\u00fcrfte wohl kaum ein Zufall sein. Der zweite Genius bringt \u201cFeigen\u201d (d\u00a3b)\u2014 wohl ein Hinweis darauf, da\u00df in der Baumpflanzung, die der K\u00f6nig in C 2 in dem unteren liegenden Rechteck vor sich hat, auch andere B\u00e4ume wie Feigenb\u00e4ume usw. vertreten waren. So wie im unteren Rechteck steht \u201cHerbeibringen des Gottesopfers,\u201d so wird in der anzunehmenden senkrechten Inschriftzeile vor dem K\u00f6nig im oberen Rechteck gestanden haben \u201cEmpfangen des Gottesopfers bestehend aus Fr\u00fcchten der Pinie (und) Feigen.\u201d Zum Schlu\u00df sollte man noch etwas festhalten, was Fakhry gar nicht erw\u00e4hnt hat. Snofrus Relief bezeugt indirekt, da\u00df unter ihm eine Expedition in das ferne Land Punt am Roten Meer etwa in die Gegend des heutigen Suakin gesandt worden sein mu\u00df, um \u2122ntjw-B\u00e4ume zu holen. Die fr\u00fcheste ausdr\u00fcckliche Erw\u00e4hnung einer Expedition nach Punt zur Beschaffung von \u2122ntjw-B\u00e4umen findet sich dann erst wieder in den Puntreliefs und Inschriften der K\u00f6nigin Hatschepsut in der 18. Dynastie im Tempel von Deir el-Bahari. Unter Ramses II. wird ausdr\u00fccklich die Anlage von \u201cvielen G\u00e4rten\u201d (b\u2122\u00a2w) \u201cmit jeder (Art von) Baum, wohlriechenden Kr\u00e4utern, den Pflanzen (rnpwt) Punts\u201d bezeugt: Kitchen, Ram.

Fazzini\nW\nilliam Kelly Simpson has long displayed an interest in the art of the New Kingdom. This was evidenced early in his Egyptological career by articles such as the one he wrote with John D. Cooney on a section of an Amarna parapet composed of fragments from the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s collection and a larger section 1 belonging to The Brooklyn Museum. Later, during his seventeen years as Curator of Egyptian and Ancient Near Eastern Art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, that interest was reflected in his department\u2019s numer2 ous acquisitions of New Kingdom art of various types. Indeed, in addition to significantly enlarging Boston\u2019s holdings of private statuary of Dynasty 18, William Kelly Simpson also wrote an important article that made many of the best of those sculptures better known and 3 understood. Hence, although the New Kingdom and private statuary of Dynasty 18 are hardly the main fields of study of this book\u2019s honoree, it is not inappropriate, I hope, to discuss and illustrate here a private sculpture of Dynasty 18 that has never been published in detail or in photographs, presumably because it is lacking its head (not to mention parts of its lower legs, feet and base). What is preserved, however, is of fine quality and warrants more attention than the brief entry and drawing of its main 1\nJohn D. Cooney and William K. Simpson, \u201cAn Architectural Fragment from Amarna,\u201d The Brooklyn Museum Bulletin 12, 4 (Summer, 1951), pp. 1\u201312. William Kelly Simpson was the first to suggest that the Metropolitan and Brooklyn fragments belonged together. He also realized, much later, that an Amarna relief in his possession most probably joined a relief in Brooklyn (William K. Simpson, The Face of Egypt: Permanence and Change in Egyptian Art, exh. cat. [Katonah, 1977], pp. 46 and 69, nos. 42\u201343), first loaning and then kindly donating his relief to The Brooklyn Museum. 2 E.g., A Table of Offerings: 17 Years of Acquisitions of Egyptian and Ancient Near Eastern Art by William Kelly Simpson for the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (Boston, 1987), pp. 24\u2013 51. 3 Willian K.

James\u2019 volume on pre-Ramesside 4 hieroglyphic texts in The Brooklyn Museum. The sculpture, illustrated 5 in Figs. 1\u20133, was acquired in the art market in 1936 with monies from The Brooklyn Museum\u2019s Charles Edwin Wilbour Fund and bears the accession number 36.613. The figure wears a skirt similar to one J. Vandier described as \u201cdemi6 longue, assez large et tr\u00e8s appr\u00eat\u00e9e,\u201d and the single column of text down the center of the skirt, visible in fig. 3, and T.G.H. James\u2019 previously published drawing (redrawn for fig. 4) reveals that the sculpture represented a high priest of Amun named Menkheperreseneb. Until recently, this sculpture has been identified as an image of the high priest by that name who served in office during the later reign of Tuthmosis III and into the early reign of Amunhotep II and owned two Theban tombs 7 (TT 86 and 112). However, Peter Dorman has recently argued compellingly that there were two related high priests of Amun named Menkheperreseneb, both holding that office under Tuthmosis III, the later Menkheperreseneb, owner of TT 112, perhaps succeeding his likenamed uncle and remaining in office until early in the reign of 8 Amunhotep II. As already indicated in James\u2019 entry on the statue, a cartouche containing the prenomen of Tuthmosis III adorns the leopard 9 10 skin on the figure\u2019s left shoulder, where it is carved in raised relief. There is nothing about the figure, however, that permits its specific attribution to either Menkheperreseneb the elder or younger. On the other hand, as Peter Dorman has also raised doubts about the longstanding attributions of two other statues (British Museum 708 and, especially, Egyptian Museum, Cairo CG 42125) to a high priest of Amun 4\nT.G.H.

Whichever of the two Menkheperresenebs is represented, Brooklyn 12 36.613 is 72 cm tall. The width of the figure at the shoulders is 26.5 cm and the width of the back slab is 32.5 cm. The maximum total depth of the sculpture is 32.8 cm, the maximum depth of the figure (at the lowest preserved portion of the right leg) being 24.5 cm. The depth of the back slab varies from 7.8 cm near the top to 8.2 cm near the bottom. Brooklyn\u2019s Menkheperreseneb was depicted with his left leg advanced, his arms pendant and his hands open against the outer sides of his thighs, the pose that Jacques Vandier labeled P(riv\u00e9). N(ouvel). E(mpire).I,D. It was extremely rare for male figures in the Old Kingdom, 13 but as Vandier\u2019s P(riv\u00e9). M(oyen). E(mpire). II,a, became common in the 14 later Middle Kingdom. An element of the statue with a longer history is the back panel, or slab, wider than the normal back pillar, which certainly dates back to 15 the Old Kingdom, and is attested in private statuary of the later Mid16 17 dle Kingdom, Second Intermediate Period, and early Dynasty 18 pri18 or to its appearance on Brooklyn 36.613. The rear of our statue\u2019s back slab appears never to have been decorated, and much of it is now taken 10 I.E.S.\nEdwards has noted that cartouches of a king on a high priest\u2019s leopard skin could reflect the priest\u2019s status as that king\u2019s deputy: Treasures of Tutankhamun, exh. cat. (New York, 1976), p. 105. However, such cartouches were not limited to high priests as indicated, for example, by a representation of two priests in a bark procession from Tuthmosis III\u2019s temple at Deir el Bahri (Jadwiga Lipinska, \u201cList of the Objects Found at Deir el-Bahari Temple of Tuthmosis III Season 1960/1962,\u201d ASAE 59 [1966], p. 73, no. 18 and pl. VI). As Erich Winter has noted, cartouches on leopard skins of Dynasty 18 priests are the harbingers of more elaborate inscriptions on sashes worn by leopard skin-clad priests in later times: \u201cEine \u00e4gyptische Bronze aus Ephesos,\u201d Z\u00c4S 97 (1971), pp. 152\u201353. Although different in concept, we might note that it is during the reign of Tuthmosis III that owners of private statues began to have the cartouche of their sovereign carved into the bare \u201cflesh\u201d on the statue\u2019s shoulders or upper arms: Henry G. Fischer, in Edward L.B. Terrace and Henry G. Fischer, Treasures of the Cairo Museum.

If related to either of the high priests named Menkheperreseneb, British Museum statue 708 would have represented him as \u201csecond priest\u201d in an early stage of his career. 12 The height of 59.5 cm given in James, Corpus \u2026 1, is an erroneous figure taken from the then-existing records for the statue. 13 Jacques Vandier, Manuel \u2026 3, pp. 61, 227, 434. 14 In discussing a statue group of the time of Sesostris III, Henry G. Fischer has observed (in Treasures of the Cairo Museum \u2026, p. 81), \u201cDuring the later half of the Twelfth Dynasty, statuary becomes increasingly monumental in the literal sense of the word. The attitude of men is frequently as passive as that of women\u2014in the majority of cases they no longer have one or both hands fisted, but hold their hands flat upon their lap or at their sides.\u201d\n214\n16 FAZZINI Page 215 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:21 PM\nRichard A. Fazzini, A Statue of a High Priest Menkheperreseneb in The Brooklyn Museum\nup by two large depressions that may indicate it was ultimately used as a surface for crushing or grinding. Alas, we cannot determine how high the back slab extended nor whether the top was straight, with or without rounded corners, or round. What may appear in the illustration to be the rounded upper left-hand corner of the back slab is actually a break. Although the head is missing, enough of the neck and the shoulders are preserved to make it certain that Menkheperreseneb was not wearing the broad wig reaching down to or even covering part of each shoul19 der that was his era\u2019s most common wig type. This means that Menkheperreseneb was depicted with either a short wig, such as those 20 sometimes worn in Dynasty 17 and early Dynaty 18 or with a shaven head, which is rare for Dynasty 18, and especially rare for early Dynasty 21 18 statues of adult males. William Kelly Simpson once wrote, at the beginning of a catalogue entry on a headless Ramesside statuette whose owner was depicted with a leopard skin and elaborate, pleated skirt, that \u201cfrequently the accidental absence of a head is useful in drawing attention to the details of the body, in this case to an elaborate ceremonial 22 costume.\u201d This holds true, as well, for Brooklyn\u2019s Menkheperreseneb. It is unfortunate, however, that we cannot determine whether the statue was shaven-headed, like many New Kingdom relief representations of 15 Baudouin\nvan de Walle, \u201cR\u00fcckenpfeiler,\u201d L\u00c4 5 (1984), col. 316.\n16 In their publication of a 105 cm tall statue group of late Dynasty 12, (\u201cEin Denkmal zum\nKult des K\u00f6nigs Unas am Ende der 12.

If it were, it would be possibly one of the earliest known three-dimensional images of a shaven-headed priest wearing a leopard skin. In fact, to this writer\u2019s knowlege, there are no real three-dimensional prototypes for The Brooklyn Museum\u2019s Menkheperreseneb depiction as a priest. The Mus\u00e9e du Louvre\u2019s late Dynasty 12 group of high priests of 24 Ptah is very different in appearance, lacking a leopard skin and wearing a very different type of calf-length skirt. Surely more relevant, although hardly a close parallel, is Cairo, Egyptian Museum CG 395, a statue of King Amunemhat III as a leopard skin-cloaked priestly stan25 dard bearer. Given our present knowledge, it would seem to be the first \u201cpriestly\u201d statue with leopard skin and the last three-dimensional king\u2019s image wearing such a garment until much later in Dynasty 18 than the 26 reign of Tuthmosis III. This statue has been claimed as the possible source for the depiction of a leopard skin cloak on Mus\u00e9e du Louvre A 76, a block statue of a non-clerical official of late Dynasty 12 or 27 Dynasty 13. The reign of Tuthmosis III provides us with another block statue with leopard skin that represents a man who held a number of priestly 28 titles.

Fazzini, A Statue of a High Priest Menkheperreseneb in The Brooklyn Museum\nMenkheperreseneb statue, is Cairo, Egyptian Museum CG 70038 from 29 Abydos, a frontal figure of the high priest of Memphis, Ptahmose I, carved in bold relief. Although represented with a wig and sidelock, Ptahmose, like Brooklyn\u2019s Menkheperreseneb, also wears a leopard skin mantle and a calf-length skirt. Moreover, from his belt hangs a pendant element of attire that is one of Ludwig Borchardt\u2019s examples of what he interpreted as an instrument container carried by astronomers and sur30 veyors, about which more will be said below. Here suffice it to say that the pendant element on the right side of the skirt of Brooklyn\u2019s Menkheperreseneb is another example of Borchardt\u2019s \u201cinstrument case.\u201d To be sure, there are significant differences between the statues of Menkheperreseneb and Ptahmose. Nevertheless, the sculpture from Abydos at least indicates that the statue of Menkheperreseneb as priest was not a wholly unique monument of its era. If there are no truly good prototypes for Brooklyn\u2019s statue of Menkheperreseneb, it is itself a good harbinger of some later works. One such sculpture is part of a block statue in Copenhagen\u2019s Ny Carlsberg 31 Glyptothek, inscribed for a man named Paser. Carved half in the round before the squatting Paser is a smaller, standing male figure who has at least one hand open at his side and wears a leopard skin mantle arranged in a manner similar to Menkheperreseneb\u2019s. He also wears a calf-length skirt and, like Menkheperreseneb, the \u201castronomer\u2019s/surveyor\u2019s instrument case\u201d to the right of the leopard\u2019s head. To judge from published photographs, the figure\u2019s head may have been shaven. This statue has 32 twice been dated to Ramesside times, but R. Schulz has recently argued that it should be ascribed to the Tuthmoside period in general 33 and to the reign of Amunhotep II in particular. If so, this figure, whose identity remains uncertain, would provide the closest near-contempo34 rary parallel for significant aspects of the figure of Menkheperreseneb. 28\nLondon, The British Museum 888: Regine Schulz, Die Entwicklung \u2026 kuboiden Statuentypus, vol. 1, pp. 377\u201378, and vol. 2, pl. 98a\u2013b. 29 G\u00fcnther Roeder, Service des Antiquit\u00e9s de l\u2019Egypte.

One is the statue of Taitai, high priest of Horus, lord 35 of Hebenu, that is probably from Middle Egypt. His leopard skin is arranged differently than Menkheperreseneb\u2019s, his hands are in a different pose, and his \u201castronomer\u2019s/surveyor\u2019s instrument case\u201d descends directly from the head of his leopard skin. Nevertheless, it is a statue of a high priest who is clearly shaven-headed and wearing a skirt similar to Menkheperreseneb\u2019s, if somewhat shorter, and is basically a related type of priestly image. Far closer to Menkheperreseneb\u2019s statue in many 36 details is Turin\u2019s well-known statue of Anen, from Thebes. Although Anen wears a shoulder-length wig, the pose of his statue, the shape of his skirt, the basic arrangement of his leopard skin and its decoration with star-shapes and with a cartouche containing prenomen, the position and general shape of his \u201castronomer\u2019s/surveyor\u2019s case\u201d and the adornment of its lower section with another cartouche with prenomen are all more or less closely prefigured in the statue of Menkheperre37 seneb. Another statue with more than a passing resemblance to the Brooklyn Menkheperreseneb in terms of pose and attire is, unfortunately, an uninscribed and unprovenanced Late Period image of a shaven-headed 38 priest now in Baltimore. First appearing in Dynasty 19 and commonplace in priestly images of the Late Period are inscribed bands or sashes 39 on leopard skins. The absence of such a sash on the Baltimore statue 34 It\nis difficult simply to accept Schulz\u2019s stylistic arguments for dating on the basis of the published photographs, but it certainly seems possible that she is correct. Most difficult to accept is her suggestion that the figure may be represent a statue of Paser, the subject of the block statue, rather than one of his relatives or a superior. 35 \u00c4gyptisches Museum, Staatliche Museen Preu\u00dfischer Kulturbesitz, Berlin, no. 17021: Betsy Bryan, in Egypt\u2019s Dazzling Sun: Amenhotep III and His World, exh. cat. (Cleveland, 1992), pp. 248\u201349, illus. 36 Turin, Museo Egizio 5484. Normally published in a three-quarter right frontal view, a good full frontal view of this statue was published in Claude Vandersleyen, et al., Das Alte \u00c4gypten, Propyl\u00e4en Kunstgeschichte 15 (Frankfurt am Main, Berlin and Vienna, 1975), pl. 187b. For some of the many publications of this statue, see PM II2, p. 214, where it is described as presumably from the area of Karnak\u2019s Amun-Re-Horakhty temple because of the appearance of a statue on a plate in Jean-Jacques Rifaud\u2019s Voyage en Egypte, en Nubie, et lieux circonvoisins, depuis 1805 jusqu\u2019en 1827 (Paris, 1830), pl. 42, that resembles it somewhat. The plate is captioned \u201cstatues en granit, d\u00e9couvertes par l\u2019auteur dans les fouilles \u00e0 Thebes, \u00e0 la partie est du grand temple de Karnak.\u201d The statue in the plate, however, shows an un-Egyptian-looking back pillar rising high above the figure\u2019s head, lacks the inscription down the front of the skirt, reverses the writing of Amunhotep III\u2019s prenomen in the cartouche on the leopard skin on Anen\u2019s shoulder, ignores the writing of Amunhotep III\u2019s nomen on the upper part of Anen\u2019s \u201castronomer\u2019s/surveyor\u2019s instrument case,\u201d and includes a cartouche with Amunhotep III\u2019s nomen at the bottom of that element where Anen\u2019s statue has the king\u2019s prenomen. Betsy Bryan\u2019s recent publication of the Turin statue (Egypt\u2019s Dazzling Sun, pp. 249\u201350, illus.) argues that Anen\u2019s statue was made for Amunhotep III\u2019s mortuary temple.\n218\n16 FAZZINI Page 219 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:21 PM\nRichard A. Fazzini, A Statue of a High Priest Menkheperreseneb in The Brooklyn Museum\nhas been seen as an archaizing element by the publisher of a Late Period statuette of a presumably shaven-headed overseer of priests of Horus of Hierakonpolis (possibly from that site) whose hands are open at his 40 sides, and who wears a leopard skin and a calf-length skirt. This suggestion could very well be true. However, it is difficult to accept the same author\u2019s claim that the statuette\u2019s plain skirt, which resembles that of the Walters Art Gallery\u2019s anonymous priest, is another archaizing 41 element adopted from the Old and Middle Kingdoms. The suggested prototypes from those periods do not resemble the statuette\u2019s skirt as much as do the semi-long, broad and stiff skirts shown, for example, on the statues of Menkheperreseneb, Taitai (shorter) and Anen. Because it is difficult to cite works of Dynasty 25 or 26 that definitely show a pendant element of attire like the one on the Walters Art Gallery statue or its forerunners already cited, it is also conceivable, although hardly certain, that the \u201castronomer\u2019s/surveyor\u2019s instrument case\u201d on the Walters statue is another archaizing element. To be sure, Borchardt\u2019s article on this \u201cinstrument case\u201d included relief representations of Montuemhat and his son Nesptah on the stela forming the rear of a pair statue, and on a statue of a priest of unknown provenance 42 attributed to the \u201cSp\u00e4tzeit.\u201d However, Jean Leclant, no less reason43 ably, has interpreted the element in the first example as clerical bands. 44 Moreover, although it is sometimes accepted as Late Period, even Borchardt was not always so sure of the date of his second example, which he first published as \u201cSp\u00e4tzeit?,\u201d which could be earlier, and 37 The\ncartouche on Menkheperreseneb\u2019s \u201castronomer\u2019s/surveyor\u2019s instrument case\u201d was not noted in T.G.H. James, Corpus \u2026 1. The writer would like to thank Donald Spanel and Paul O\u2019Rourke for assistance in checking the statue\u2019s inscriptions and Mary McKercher for assistance in documenting other aspects of the statue\u2019s decoration. Menkheperreseneb\u2019s statue does not appear to parallel Anen\u2019s statue in having a small, horizontal cartouche with his sovereign\u2019s nomen further up on the \u201csatchel.\u201d 38 Walters Art Gallery 22.113; height complete: 61 cm.

Borchardt also identified an example of his \u201castronomer\u2019s/surveyor\u2019s instrument case\u201d on a Karnak stela of the 46 Dynasty 21 high priest Menkheperre. It seems difficult, however, to be sure of the equation of the element on this figure, or of the similar pen47 dant element on a late Dynasty 20 image of Herihor as high priest, with the element worn by Menkheperreseneb and Anen, which is rectangular and divided into several sections, and is suspended from cordlike elements. Except for the Walters Art Gallery statue, none of the Third Intermediate or Late Period images known to this writer show the \u201cinstrument case\u201d suspended from a cord tied around the waist or, as in the statues of Anen and Menkheperreseneb, the division of the vertical suspension elements into two zones, the divider on Anen\u2019s statue bearing a cartouche. The lack of an inscription on the Walters Art Gallery statue means it cannot be used to link the pendant element of attire under question to more than priests in general. Borchardt identified it as an astronomer\u2019s or surveyor\u2019s instrument case essentially because individuals shown wearing it included people to whom those labels might possibly be 48 attributed, one of them being Anen, by virtue of his title wr-m\u00a3w. But there is nothing in the titles of a number of individuals shown with this 49 element of attire, including Menkheperreseneb, that links them to astronomy and surveying; and if Borchardt\u2019s interpretation of the object 50 has still been accepted in relatively recent years, Borchardt himself 51 called his interpretation only an \u201cattempted explanation.\u201d It is hence not surprising that Borchardt\u2019s theory has sometimes been questioned. 45 Ludwig Borchardt,\nService des Antiquit\u00e9s de l\u2019Egypte.

Fazzini, A Statue of a High Priest Menkheperreseneb in The Brooklyn Museum\nFor example, in a discussion of what he termed \u201ca peculiar satchel\u201d or \u201cpriestly satchel generally divided into three or more pockets(?)\u201d in paintings of priests in the Dynasty 19 Theban Tomb of Khonsu, called To (TT 31), Norman de Garis Davies noted Borchardt\u2019s theory and suggested that it might have been meant for holding papyri for recitation and that its use in the tomb \u201conly by priests of Montu or of a royal cult 52 when engaged in rites \u2026 does not point to astronomy.\u201d The priests in the images Davies was discussing were all \u00a2m-n\u2020r tpy of the cults of regular deities or deceased kings, and the \u201cinstrument case\u201d or \u201csatchel\u201d has also sometimes been associated specifically with \u201cfirst prophets.\u201d For example, Georges Legrain described it as it appears on Cairo Egyptian Museum CG 42156, a statue of Paser, high priest of 53 Amun, as \u201cla trousse du grand pr\u00eatre d\u2019Amon.\u201d And Etienne Drioton believed it was shown worn (on the right side of a kilt with triangular front panel) with a leopard skin mantle as the costume of the high priests of Amun on Mus\u00e9e du Louvre E 11609, a statue of Tutankhamun protected by Amun, even though it was not limited to the high priests 54 of Amun or other gods. Considering the \u201cinstrument case\u201d some sort of container, Norman de Garis Davies noted a possible relationship between it and at least one image of what he identified as a sporran worn by a relief figure of King 55 Amunhotep III when acting as priest. However, unlike the pendant element of attire on the Louvre statue of Tutankhamun and Amun, the royal regalia cited by Davies does not look like one of Borchardt\u2019s \u201cinstrument cases.\u201d On the other hand, and as noted by Paul Barguet and Jean Leclant, a pendant element of attire that Borchardt would presumably have considered an \u201cinstrument case\u201d is suspended from a leopard head on the front of the triangular panel of the kilt worn by one of the standard bearer statues of King Amunhotep III in the Karnak 56 Precinct of Montu. In recent days the similarity between this element, 52\nNorman de Garis Davies, Seven Private Tombs at urnah, Mond Excavations at Thebes 2 (London, 1948), p. 14, n. 3.\n53\nGeorges Legrain, Service des Antiquit\u00e9s de l\u2019Egypte.

And the \u201cinstrument cases\u201d on statues such as those of Taitai and Anen have been redefined as a \u201cjeweled apron\u201d and \u201can apron, presumably of precious 58 metal.\u201d While this may be the most recent and certainly reasonable interpretation of this element of attire, it is not certain that they should all be considered as similar as Borchardt considered them. For example, Luc Limme, who accepts Borchardt\u2019s interpretation of some of the \u201castronomer\u2019s and surveyor\u2019s instrument cases,\u201d has argued that this definition would not be appropriate to the functions of Memphite high priests of Ptah. He also notes that Borchardt mistakenly identified those priests\u2019 \u201cr\u00e9seau de perles\u201d as \u201cinstrument cases\u201d in his two cited examples of 59 Memphite priests of Ptah wearing this element. One of Limme\u2019s instances of such a mistaken identity is on the bold relief image of Ptahmose I (CG 70038) mentioned above and dated to the reign of Tuthmosis III. And following Limme, this would make Brooklyn\u2019s statue of Menkheperreseneb the earliest known appearance of the \u201cinstrument case\u201d/\u201capron\u201d or, in the words of Elisabeth Staehelin, \u201cEin 60 Abzeichen h\u00f6herer Priester.\u201d The most prominent preserved feature of Menkheperreseneb\u2019s statue is the leopard skin mantle draped over his left shoulder. The leopard\u2019s head lies just below his waist level, its left foreleg dangling down past the head and the right pulled around towards the right rear of Menkheperreseneb\u2019s upper torso, while the tail is visible hanging behind Menkheperreseneb\u2019s left arm. This disposition of the garment is not universal. Among the sculptures already discussed, for instance, it resembles only that of the small figure on the front of the Copenhagen sculpture of Paser, the Turin statue of Anen and the uninscribed Baltimore statue of a priest. This general disposition of the leopard skin has sometimes been associated with upper levels of the clergy (i.e., the 61 \u201cfirst\u201d or \u201csecond\u201d prophets) from more than one site.

Fazzini, A Statue of a High Priest Menkheperreseneb in The Brooklyn Museum\n62\ncannot be assumed that it was limited to such officials, and it was not used for all images of high priests, including some already mentioned: CG 70038 (Ptahmose I, high priest of Memphis) and Berlin 17021 (Taitai, high priest of Horus, lord of Hebenu). Indeed, it has been observed that the lack of a specific costume or title for the high priest of Amun is evidence for the late appearance of this post (i.e., not until the beginning of 63 Dynasty 18) in comparison with high priesthoods of other cults. As for the leopard skin in general, one might note J\u00fcrgen von Beckerath\u2019s observation that \u201cdas Leopardenfell findet man seit dem Neuen Reich bei einer Anzahl von Priestern h\u00f6heren Ranges, ohne das man jedoch fests64 tellen k\u00f6nnte, welchen R\u00e4ngen oder T\u00e4tigkeiten es spezielle zukam.\u201d As is visible in Figs. 1\u20133, the leopard skin on the Brooklyn statue of Menkheperreseneb is adorned with stars carved in low relief, which, as others have indicated, is not unusual for a work of the New Kingdom. For example, it was over seventy years ago that Drioton observed that rose-like shapes, a star, and a star within a circle were used since 65 Dynasty 18 to represent the natural spots of a leopard skin, and von Beckerath has outlined the transformation of stars within circles into 66 rosettes on some leopard skins in Dynasties 25\u201326. The appearance of stars on garments has sometimes been seen as a 67 possible reference to priest-astronomers in general. The stars on the leopard skin of the Turin statue of Anen have often been linked to his 68 title of wr m\u00a3w m \u00a2wt-srw and, most recently, also to his claim in an 62 An\ninteresting illustration of this point could be a scene in the Theban tomb (TT 48) of Amunemhat, called Surer: Torgny S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh, Private Tombs at Thebes 1, Four Eighteenth Dynasty Tombs (Oxford, 1957), p. 41 and pl. XL. If this very poorly preserved composition is restored and interpreted correctly by S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh, it depicts a row of eight images of Surer, each wearing a leopard skin in the manner of Menkheperreseneb\u2019s, a kneelength skirt and an \u201cinstrument case.\u201d Exactly how this costume relates to Surer\u2019s various associations with the cult of Amun\u2014none of them as \u201cfirst prophet\u201d or \u201csecond prophet\u201d\u2014remains uncertain.

He also raises the interesting question of whether or not most of the New Kingdom depictions of leopard skins may have been of imitation leopard skins. Dagmar F\u00f6rster (\u201cA Late Period Statue \u2026,\u201d p. 48) sees the use of rose-like forms instead of stars or stars within circles on the leopard skin of the late statuette of a priest in the Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum as another example of archaizing on that figure, one that goes back to the statue of Amunemhat III cited in n. 25, above. If he is correct, the Walters Art Gallery figure of a priest should be considered similarly archaizing. However, as not all New Kingdom images of leopard skins bear stars, stars in circles, or even rose-shaped markings, the presence of such markings in later figures may not necessarily be archaizing. 67 Ludwig Borchardt, \u201cDie Instrumentasche \u2026,\u201d p. 20: \u201cPriester mit besternten Pantherfellen\u2014Astronomen?\u201d 64 J\u00fcrgen\n223\n16 FAZZINI Page 224 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:21 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\n69\ninscription to astronomical knowledge. While this may be true in Anen\u2019s instance, it does not necessarily follow that a star-spangled leopard skin must have the same meaning on images of other individuals. 70 Many, but not all, representations of priests wearing star-studded leopard skins are Theban. Yet even if one considers only Theban images, one finds a variety of priests represented, including high priests of vari71 72 ous deities, such as Montu, and of the cults of deceased kings, and 73 priests of other ranks. The use of stars or stars within circles for the markings on leopard skins is also found on actual garments from the tomb of Tutankhamun, which included both real and imitation skins. I.E.S. Edwards\u2019 comments on these in the catalogue of the 1970s Tut74 ankhamun exhibition include a possible relationship between this phenomenon and the king\u2019s role as high priest of Heliopolis. He also suggests that stars in circles, which resemble the hieroglyph for d(w)\u00a3t, might otherwise only be found on images of high priests of the deceased king, a suggestion that some of the references already given demonstrates is not true. In the same place, Edwards further expressed the belief that the use of both stars and stars within circles on one of Tutankhamun\u2019s garments was unique. However, not only does this combination appear on the leopard skin worn by the Louvre\u2019s statue of 75 Tutankhamun before Amun, it also appears, for example, on an image of the high priest, Khonsu, in the shrine in his tomb where he offers to 76 on a statue of an \u00a1t-n\u2020r and sm-priest of Osiris and Anubis; 68\nE.g., Wolfgang Helck, \u201cPriestertracht,\u201d L\u00c4 4 (1982), col. 1105; Mohamed Moursi, Die Hohenpriester des Sonnengottes von der Fr\u00fchzeit \u00c4gyptens bis zum Ende des Neuen Reiches, M\u00c4S 26 (Berlin, 1972), p. 156.\n69 Betsy\nBryan, in Egypt\u2019s Dazzling Sun, p. 250.

Fazzini, A Statue of a High Priest Menkheperreseneb in The Brooklyn Museum\n77\nDynasty 20; and on the Brooklyn statue of Menkheperreseneb, stars and stars within circles appear in alternating rows. Whatever the meaning of this combination of stars and stars within circles decorating leopard skins, the Brooklyn Menkheperreseneb statue may provide its earliest dated occurrence. The provenance of Menkheperreseneb\u2019s statue is not known. The Brooklyn Museum\u2019s accession records for the statue state that the vendor claimed it came from Bedrashein which is, of course, near Memphis and Saqqara. Given the current state of our knowledge, one cannot exclude the possibility that it may once have stood in Memphis. However, even if Menkheperreseneb\u2019s statue was at Bedrashein at one time, it may have reached there from someplace further south, which is one reason our old accession records also indicate that the vendor\u2019s statement was \u201cprobably untrue\u201d and that a provenance of Thebes or Karnak was more probable. Given the Theban provenance of the closest parallels for elements of its form, the invocation of offerings from the offering table of Amun on the text on the skirt, and the fact that both Menkheperresenebs were high priests of Amun at Thebes, it is extremely tempting to ascribe the statue to that city. Moreover, even though the text on the statue does not refer to Ipet-sut, the statue, if it is from Thebes, is probably more likely to be from Karnak than the West Bank. While the provenance of the Brooklyn statue of Menkheperreseneb is uncertain, the statue itself is surely one of the relatively rare 78 Dynasty 18 private (as opposed to royal) statues in pink granite, which is appropriate for a fine and, as we have seen, perhaps quite innovative sculpture of the Tuthmoside era.\nb\n76 Norman\nde Garis Davies, Seven Private Tombs \u2026, pl. XVIII.

XLIX. 78\nFor the rarity of such sculptures, see Thierry de Putter and Christina Karlshausen, Les pierres utilis\u00e9es dans la sculpture et l\u2019architecture de l\u2019Egypte pharaonique. Guide pratique illustr\u00e9 (Brussels, 1992), p. 85; and idem, \u201cWhy did Akhenaten forsake the use of pink granite?,\u201d GM 130 (1992), p. 21. Another private work in pink granite of the reign of Tuthmosis III is Museum of Fine Arts, Boston 29.728, a statue of the Vizier Neferweben: Dows Dunham, \u201cThree Inscribed Statues in Boston,\u201d JEA 15 (1929), pp. 164\u201365, and pl. XXXII. If Karlshausen and De Putter are correct in characterizing pink granite private sculptures as rare in Dynasty 18, it is more difficult to accept their contention that Akhenaten abandoned the use of that stone after his installation at Akhetaten. In Egyptological literature, the terms pink and red granite often mean the same or essentially the same stone. Reports on the excavations at Amarna include a reasonable number of references to fragments of royal sculptures in such stone: e.g., John Pendlebury et al., The City of Akhenaten 3, The Central City and The Official Quarters, The Egypt Exploration Society, Forty-Fourth Memoir (London, 1951), pp. 37, 45, 46, 61, 62, 63, 64, 66, 72.\n225\n17 FECHT Page 227 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:21 PM\nDer beredte Bauer: die zweite Klage\nGerhard Fecht\nH\nerrn Kollegen Simpson, dem bew\u00e4hrten Kenner und Erschlie\u00dfer \u00e4gyptischer Texte sei diese Untersuchung der zweiten Klage gewidmet. Sie sollte als Kostprobe einer Gesamtbearbeitung der \u201cBauerngeschichte\u201d aufgefa\u00dft werden, die ich noch zu leisten hoffe. Auf die inzwischen vielfach er\u00f6rterte Frage des zeitlichen Ansatzes des Archetyps der \u201cBauerngeschichte\u201d gehe ich nicht ein, doch werden einige generelle Bemerkungen dazu wohl mit Recht erwartet. William Kelly Simpson hat in GM 120 (1991), S. 95 meine Position als \u201copting for a compromise\u201d gesehen. Dem stimme ich gerne zu. Freilich m\u00f6chte ich den Kompromi\u00df dahin interpretieren, da\u00df der Archetyp doch wohl in der Ersten Zwischenzeit anzusetzen ist, w\u00e4hrend das, was wir vor den Augen haben, eben diverse\u2014und dies im Wortsinn des lateinischen diversus\u2014mittel\u00e4gyptische Bearbeitungen sind, die auf einer oder mehreren Umarbeitungen des alten Textes in mittel\u00e4gyptische Metrik basieren und\u2014in unbekanntem Ausma\u00df, vermutlich auch ohne rigorose Konsequenz\u2014mittel\u00e4gyptische Sprache. Wir k\u00f6nnen nur hoffen, da\u00df bei aller \u00c4nderung die Gedankenf\u00fchrung als solche nicht zu sehr beeintr\u00e4chtigt worden ist. J. Assmann schreibt in Ma\u2122at (M\u00fcnchen, 1990), S. 45, im Anschlu\u00df an Leo Oppenheim: Ohne Kanonisierung l\u00e4\u00dft sich der \u2018Traditionsstrom\u2019 nicht stillstellen, er ver\u00e4ndert nicht nur den Bestand, sondern auch die Gestalt der Texte und verlagert sein Bett mit jeder Epoche. Das ist das Problem der \u00e4gyptischen und der mesopotamischen \u00dcberlieferung.\nWenn er dann aber auf S. 59 von den \u201cKlagen des Oasenmannes\u201d meint: \u201cDer Text geh\u00f6rt zu jenen Literaturwerken, die im sp\u00e4teren Mittleren Reich entstehen, aber in die Erste Zwischenzeit zur\u00fcckversetzt werden\u201d, so ist das widerspr\u00fcchlich und etwas vorschnell. Ich f\u00fcrchte, da\u00df mit den Fragen um Titel und Verbalformen die Archetypen nur unter sehr g\u00fcnstigen Bedingungen zeitlich festgelegt werden k\u00f6nnen. Unsere Basis ist ja schmal. Da\u00df uns einiges von den einst in den Jahrhunderten des MR vorhandenen literarischen Handschriften \u00fcberhaupt greifbar blieb, ist doch das Ergebnis einiger sehr unwahrscheinlicher Zuf\u00e4lle. Es gen\u00fcgt, auf die Darstellung aus der Hand Simpsons zu\n17 FECHT Page 228 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:21 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nverweisen: \u201cPapyri of the Middle Kingdom\u201d, in: Textes et langages de l\u2019Egypte pharaonique (ed. S. Sauneron), II, S. 63\u201372. Wenn nun in diesem minimalen Restbestand immer wieder ganz erhebliche Unterschiede zwischen den Textzeugen zu einem und demselben Literaturwerk auffallen, m\u00fcssen wir schlie\u00dfen, da\u00df es einst bei solchen Werken eine bunte Vielfalt von mehr oder minder stark voneinander abweichenden Redaktionen gegeben hat. \u00c4gyptische Literatur kannte keine Stabilisierung wie die Homerischen Epen durch die Lesung bei den Panathen\u00e4en, sie kannte keine fr\u00fchen philologischen Bem\u00fchungen wie die klassisch antike Literatur\u2014\u201cPhilologie\u201d ist nicht nur als Wort griechisch\u2014geschweige denn so etwas wie die Akademie von Alexandria. Sie kannte auch keine Behandlung als Kanon heiliger Schriften, an denen nichts ge\u00e4ndert werden darf. All das ist nichts Neues, alle wissen das. Zwischen dem MR und der Ersten Zwischenzeit (Nordreich) liegt die Schwelle des \u00dcbergangs von der \u00e4lteren zur j\u00fcngeren Form der Metrik. Wo Handschriften des MR oder des NR erhalten sind, die die \u00e4ltere Metrik aufweisen, m\u00fcssen wir zwar auch mit Modernisierungen rechnen, doch d\u00fcrften sich diese in etwas bescheidenerem Ma\u00df halten. Dar\u00fcber habe ich in Hommages \u00e0 Fran\u00e7ois Daumas geschrieben: Ptahhotep. Entsprechendes zu der Lehre f\u00fcr Merikare steht noch aus. Bei unserem \u201cBauer\u201d haben wir aber leider durchgehend MR-Metrik, wie z.B. auch beim \u201cLebensm\u00fcden\u201d. Ein Versuch, dem Verst\u00e4ndnis schwieriger Texte n\u00e4herzukommen, bleibt immer sinnvoll. Und vielleicht kommt man auf diesem Wege auch einmal zur Datierung des Archetyps. Umschrift nach B 1 (119\u2013170) Ich folge im Zweifelsfall der Umschreibung von R.B. Parkinson (1991). Wo ich das ausnahmsweise nicht tue, setze ich einen Asterisk (*) vor die Umschreibung. Das ist dann keine Kritik an Parkinson. Bei hieratisch einander sehr \u00e4hnlichen Zeichen und bei fachsprachlichen oder sonst ungew\u00f6hnlichen W\u00f6rtern ist damit zu rechnen, da\u00df in einer der zeitlich vorausgehenden Abschriften und m\u00f6glicherweise im Archetyp der in B1 vorliegenden MR-Redaktion der \u201cBauerngeschichte\u201d ein anderes, hieratisch \u00e4hnliches Zeichen gestanden hat. Im gegebenen Fall nehme ich die zuletzt genannte M\u00f6glichkeit an. Es handelt sich also nicht um abweichende Lesungen sondern um Emendationen. Ich bleibe bei der alten Bezeichnung \u201cBauer\u201d und \u201cBauerngeschichte\u201d, obwohl der Held dieser \u201cGeschichte\u201d kein Bauer war. Die Alternative \u201cOasenbewohner\u201d klingt so b\u00fcrokratisch wie eine Volksz\u00e4hlung, und auch \u201cOasenmann\u201d ist unbefriedigend (was ist dann seine\n228\n17 FECHT Page 229 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:21 PM\nGerhard Fecht, Der beredte Bauer: die zweite Klage\nFamilie\u2014die Oasenfrau und die Oasenkinder?). Es steht hier \u00e4hnlich wie beim \u201cPseudopartizip\u201d, das alte Unrichtige ist manchmal das immer noch ein klein wenig bessere, jedenfalls dann, wenn man f\u00fcr Fachgenossen schreibt. Die Wiedergabe der Hieroglyphen soll lediglich das jeweils gemeinte Wort (/die grammatische Form) leicht erkennbar machen, ich bevorzuge deshalb ausf\u00fchrliche Schreibungen.

Einwurf des Rensi trennt vom Zweiten Teil. Erste Strophe (V.1\u201312): \u201cDas Richtige\u201d. In der ersten Halbstrophe von sechs Versen (2+2+2) wird Rensi als besonders Gro\u00dfer und besonders Reicher angesprochen. In seinem Umkreis ist das realistisch gesehen. Jedoch ist das zun\u00e4chst nur das \u00c4u\u00dfere. Deshalb entspricht in der n\u00e4chsten Halbstrophe zu sechs Versen (2+1, 2+1) in Vers 9 der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe und dem Reichtum die bildhafte Nennung seiner Rolle, zumal als Richter: \u201cSenklotschnur, die-das-Gewicht-tr\u00e4gt\u201d, und in Vers 12 die daraus sich ergebende Verpflichtung: \u201cSenklotschnur, mache-keine-Abweichungen!\u201d Die Metapher \u201cSenklotschnur\u201d etc. ist identisch mit dem tp-\u00a2sb (in Vers 25) \u201cRechnen, korrekte Methode, Richtigkeit, Norm des Handelns\u201d. \u201cSchnur, die das Gewicht tr\u00e4gt\u201d meint ja die Kontrolle der Richtigkeit der Waage, denn sie mu\u00df mit dem \u201cZeiger\u201d der Waage \u00fcbereinstimmen. Das ist der Ma\u00dfstab der Maat, der \u201cWeltordnung als Gerechtigkeit\u201d.1 Als Garant der Maat wird aber Rensi auch zum \u201cSteuerruder des Himmels\u201d und zum \u201cTragbalken der Erde\u201d: Vers 7 und 1 So\nmit Assmann, Ma\u2122at, S. 34.\n235\n17 FECHT Page 236 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:21 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\n8, und er hat die daraus sich ergebenden Verpflichtungen: Vers 10 und 11. Der Autor denkt eingleisig prinzipiell-konsequent und kommt damit folgerichtig zu unseren Formeln, die sp\u00e4ter gelegentlich in K\u00f6nigseulogien belegt sind, aber gewi\u00df nicht erst im beginnenden NR geschaffen wurden. Ich sehe hier im Gegensatz zu J. Assmann, L\u00c4 2, 43 keine Ironie sondern allenfalls eine rhetorisch legitime Hyperbel als Gedanken-Tropus. Die Maat, f\u00fcr die Rensi einzustehen hat, ist offenbar empfindlich. Sie zerbricht unter seinem Falschverhalten, wie dann Strophe 3 zeigt. Dazu ist zu bedenken, da\u00df es keine kodifizierte Gesetzes-Norm gab, auch kein heiliges Buch mit verbindlicher Ethik. Es gab wohl geachtete Schriften, zumal Weisheits- oder Lebenslehren, aus denen man zitiert, aber\u2014mit J. Assmann, Maat, S. 45\u2014: \u201cOhne Kanonisierung l\u00e4\u00dft sich der \u2018Traditionsstrom\u2019 nicht stillstellen, er ver\u00e4ndert nicht nur den Bestand, sondern auch die Gestalt der Texte und verlagert sein Bett mit jeder Epoche. Das ist das Problem der \u00e4gyptischen und der mesopotamischen \u00dcberlieferung\u201d. Hinzu kommt, da\u00df zur Zeit der Niederschrift der \u201cBauerngeschichte\u201d\u2014sicherlich des Archetyps des Textes\u2014der Begriff Maat verunsichert gewesen zu sein scheint. In der sechsten Klage (B1 282\u2013283) steht: 2 m\u00a2 nfr 2 n\u00b4-hqs n\u00b4-wbn-m\u00a3\u2122t 2 F\u00fclle gut, 2 ohne-da\u00df-verk\u00fcrzt-ist, noch-da\u00df-\u00fcberquillt-die-Maat!\nDas kann keine Warnung vor Gro\u00dfz\u00fcgigkeit sein, dahinter ist eher eine Kraft zu vermuten, die mehr \u201cgef\u00fcllt\u201d bekommen wollte und dies als Maat ansah.

Es gibt offenbar eine Schein-Maat, die von gewissen Leuten als Maat angesehen und propagiert wird, und man hat erlebt, da\u00df etwas zun\u00e4chst gut Erscheinendes von Menschen ausgehen kann, in denen man keine Guten sieht, und deren \u201cGutes\u201d nicht gut sein kann, weil es bei Unkritischen, also der Masse der Menschen, das Schlechte beliebt macht. Hinzu stelle ich einen geradezu krassen Spruch aus dem jw-msKorpus der Admonitions (5,3\u20135,4): 3 jw-ms-m\u00a3\u2122t \u221et-t\u00a3 m-rn.s-pwjj 3 jzft-pw jrr(w).sn \u00a2r-grg-\u00a2r.s 3 Wahrlich-die-Maat ist-durch-das-Land-hin in-diesem-ihrem-Namen, 3 doch-Unrecht-ist-es, das-sie-tun, indem-sie-sich-auf-es-verlassen.\nGardiner2 hatte Zweifel an der ihm von Sethe vorgeschlagenen Lesung m\u00a3\u2122t, die jedoch auf meiner Infrarotfotografie des Papyrus eindeutig richtig ist. Hier haben wir also die Schein-Maat. Es bleibt bei Sethes Vorschlag \u201cdem Namen nach\u201d, was im Zusammenhang meinen mu\u00df: \u201cnur der willk\u00fcrlichen Benennung, nicht dem Wesen entsprechend\u201d. Der Name als \u00e4u\u00dferer Schein ist aber eine sonst aus \u00c4gypten nicht bekannte Vorstellung, es ist so extrem un\u00e4gyptisch,3 da\u00df man st\u00e4rkste Zweifel an der Echtheit h\u00e4tte, st\u00fcnde der Text irgendwo isoliert. Gerade dies zeigt das Au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnliche der gemeinten Situation, gewi\u00df auch hinsichtlich ihrer geistigen Bew\u00e4ltigung. Ich bin also \u00fcberzeugt, da\u00df der \u201cBauer\u201d eine \u00fcberwundene tief greifende Umbruchszeit reflektiert. Dies bleibt auch dann g\u00fcltig, wenn man sich auf die beiden Belege aus der \u201cBauerngeschichte\u201d beschr\u00e4nkt.4 Die Bedrohtheit der Maat versch\u00e4rft die Verantwortung des hohen Richters, der als Norm des Handelns die Maat verwirklichen mu\u00df.

Nemtinacht ist ja \u201c\u2202t\u201c-Abh\u00e4ngiger des Rensi, man kann also prinzipiell-abstrakt denkend behaupten, da\u00df auch Rensi durch das Verbrechen sich bereichert habe. Es ist interessant, da\u00df aus Deir elMedineh, d.h. aus dem sp\u00e4ten Neuen Reich, der Grundsatz nachweisbar ist, da\u00df ein an der jeweiligen Verhandlungssache pers\u00f6nlich interessierter Richter seine Funktion nicht aus\u00fcben darf.5 Das war offenbar zur Zeit der \u201cBauerngeschichte\u201d noch nicht so. Des Rensi Versto\u00df gegen die Maat (Schutz des Schwachen, Schutz des Eigentums) ist\u2014Verse 15\u201319\u2014 umso unverst\u00e4ndlicher insofern, als er alles besitzt, womit er seine Klientel versorgen kann, was ja nat\u00fcrlich beinhaltet, da\u00df er f\u00fcr sich selbst ohnehin sehr gut versorgt ist. Die genannte knappe Ration von einem Hin Bier und nicht ganz so k\u00fcmmerlichen drei Broten6 zeigt, da\u00df der ganze Passus Vers 15\u201319 die Versorgung der Klientel meint.7 Die Stelle setzt voraus, da\u00df auch bei sehr Reichen die Versorgung der Klientel problematisch sein konnte, und das hei\u00dft, da\u00df es sehr gro\u00dfe Klientelen gab. Damit ist das Thema \u201cgro\u00df und reich\u201d abgehandelt, es folgt das Thema \u201cSteuerruder, Tragbalken, Lotschnur\u201d, also: Verantwortlicher f\u00fcr die Maat, die Himmel und Erde leitet und st\u00fctzt. Die Waage ist schief, das Lot der Waage abgeirrt, und diese Metaphern f\u00fchren zur direkten Aussage \u201cder wahrhaftige Gerechte ist zum Verwirrer geworden\u201d. Damit kann nur Rensi gemeint sein, denn sich selbst sieht der \u201cBauer\u201d gewi\u00df nicht als \u201cVerwirrer\u201d oder \u201cVerwirrter\u201d, wie wir auch 4 Anders,\nwie schon oben gesagt, J. Assmann, Ma\u2122at, S. 56f., 59, 217. Ich halte aus vielerlei Gr\u00fcnden die dort vorgetragene globale L\u00f6sung f\u00fcr unrichtig. In Fecht, \u201cDer Vorwurf an Gott in den Mahnworten des Ipu-wer\u201d (1972) habe ich Datierungsfragen f\u00fcr dieses Werk auf den Seiten 10\u201327 (mit Nachtr\u00e4gen) er\u00f6rtert: Teile des Textes aus der Ersten Zwischenzeit, aus der 13. Dyn., aus der Ramessidenzeit (Endredaktion). Zur Datierung des Archetyps der \u201cBauerngeschichte\u201d soll die vorliegende Untersuchung Hinweise erbringen, deren Gewicht der Leser abw\u00e4gen wird. Neferti kann nur aus der Zeit Amenemhet I. stammen, in der Lehre f\u00fcr Merikare gibt es noch AR-Metrik (vgl. einstweilen Fecht, loc. cit. S. 223). Wie kann man sich eine nur m\u00fcndliche \u00dcberlieferung von Texten mit doch sehr unterschiedlicher und meist (auch) zeitgebundener Thematik \u00fcber mindestens 200\u2013300 Jahre vorstellen, und dies im so schreibfreudigen \u00c4gypten? Und wie k\u00f6nnen die meisten der Texte \u201cdie These von der Lebensnotwendigkeit des Staates demonstrieren\u201d? Falls sie jemals demonstriert werden mu\u00dfte, was ich nicht glaube.\u2014Die Grundlage eines Erkl\u00e4rungsversuches sehe ich vielmehr in dem ja von Assmann (Ma\u2122at, S. 45) im Anschlu\u00df an Leo Oppenheim formulierten Satz: \u201cOhne Kanonisierung l\u00e4\u00dft sich der \u2018Traditionsstrom\u2019 nicht stillstellen, er ver\u00e4ndert nicht nur den Bestand, sondern auch die Gestalt der Texte und verlagert sein Bett mit jeder Epoche. Das ist das Problem der \u00e4gyptischen und der mesopotamischen \u00dcberlieferung\u201d. Ich habe dies bewu\u00dft zum drittenmal zitiert.

Unter diesen Umst\u00e4nden ist die Maat nicht mehr bei Rensi, und es liegt nahe zu sagen, da\u00df sie fliehe, weil sie von ihrer richtigen Stelle verdr\u00e4ngt sei. Die lokale Bestimmung \u201cunter-dirhinweg\u201d ist nur zu verstehen mit dem Hinweis auf den k\u00f6niglichen Thronsockel, der die Gestalt des Maat-Zeichens hat.8 Gewi\u00df ist Rensi nicht K\u00f6nig, doch als Richter steht er der Maat-Seite des K\u00f6nigs extrem nahe. Ich vermute, da\u00df zur Zeit des \u201cBauern\u201d die Beamten in Richterfunktion auf solchen Maat-Sitzen thronten. Die richtige Deutung der Stelle ist von der Richtigkeit dieser Annahme nicht abh\u00e4ngig. Es lie\u00dfe sich auch mit einer Metapher rechnen: du vertrittst den K\u00f6nig, die Maat flieht vor dir und damit auch vor dem K\u00f6nig, dessen Thron auf dem Maat-Urh\u00fcgel ruht. Dritte Strophe (V. 24-35): \u201cDie Folge\u201d. Diese Strophe mit dem Aufbau 1+2+1,2; 2,1+2+1 ist vom Gedanken der Konsequenz beherrscht. Rensi stellt in seinem Verhalten die Norm, den Ma\u00dfstab dar. In ihm war die Maat sichtbar, erlebbar. Auch dann, wenn er die Maat verletzt, m\u00fcssen die ihm untergeordneten Beamten in dieser Maat-feindlichen Haltung die richtige Norm sehen, an der sie sich orientieren. Als Folge sieht der Redner das Chaos: die Beamten tun nun, im Glauben das Rechte zu tun, das Gegenteil, n\u00e4mlich Unrecht. Dahinter steht ein logisches Denken, da\u00df uns einseitig konsequent anmutet. Wir haben diese Art abstrakter Logik schon oben, bei der Besprechung der zweiten Strophe erw\u00e4hnt, und wir kennen sie gut aus dem Abschnitt \u201cVorwurf an Gott\u201d der Admonitions.9\n6 Wenn\nW. Helck (Das Bier im Alten \u00c4gypten [Berlin, 1971], 46f.) Recht h\u00e4tte, ist ein Hin Bier etwa 1/2 Liter, w\u00e4hrend der \u201cBauer\u201d t\u00e4glich zwei ds etwa 5\u20136 Liter erh\u00e4lt nach B1 115. Andererseits, ebenfalls W. Helck in: L\u00c4 3, 1206, n. 30 und 1213, n. 34, m\u00f6gen zwei ds etwa einen Liter ausmachen, was wahrscheinlicher wirkt. Beim Brot ist das Verh\u00e4ltnis 3:10. H. Brunner, Lehre des Cheti, 198/9, pSallier II, 10, 6/7 werden zwei Hin Bier und 3 Brote als f\u00fcr den Sch\u00fcler gen\u00fcgend angesehen. Demnach ist die Ration von einem Hin (falls kein Schreibfehler vorliegt) wirklich allzu knapp. Vielleicht handelt es sich bei den Rationen nur um Zusch\u00fcsse, die an die Klienten ausgegeben werden. 7 Zur Bedeutung der Klientel vgl.

Erste Strophe: (V. 39\u201345): Wer wird strafend abwehren, wenn alles pervertiert ist? Diese Strophe zu sieben Versen beginnt mit einem Vers, der vier Kola umfa\u00dft. Synchronisch gesehen ist das eine \u201cAusnahme\u201d, diachronisch gesehen aber steht es in einem gro\u00dfen Zusammenhang und ist von erheblichem Interesse. In der \u00e4yptologischen Linguistik ist man vielfach bestrebt, Ausnahmen zu nivellieren, man strebt nach einheitlichen Systemen. Tats\u00e4chlich gibt es niemals solche \u201cidealen\u201d Systeme, denn \u00fcberall ist Wandlung, stets gibt es sowohl Ans\u00e4tze zu vielleicht einmal sich konsolidierenden Neuerungen einerseits wie deutliche oder erst unter der Angleichungsschicht freizulegende Reste \u00e4lterer (Teil)Systeme andererseits.

In \u201cLebensm\u00fcder\u201d, Z. 55/6 hat die einzige erhaltene Handschrift den einzigen Vierheber des gesamten Textes: 4 jw-wpj.n-n.j b\u00a3.j r\u00a3.f w\u00dfb.f-\u2202d.t.n.j\nDer Kopist oder ein Besitzer des Papyrus hat sich wahrscheinlich daran gesto\u00dfen. Der \u201csitzende Mann\u201d von n.j ist, anders als die benachbarten Zeichen, auffallend stark besch\u00e4digt. Dieser auffallende Befund in zwei hohen (Archetyps-)Alters verd\u00e4chtigen Literaturwerken schreit nach einer Deutung. Ich gab diese in L\u00c4 4, Sp. 1140/1, wie schon erw\u00e4hnt, doch gehe ich hier nochmals kurz von einer anderen Seite her darauf ein. Erstens: Das Auftreten der Vierheber in spezieller Verumst\u00e4ndung kann kein Zufall sein. Die Texte sind lang, es finden sich keine weiteren Vierheber. Zweitens: Es bestand nicht der mindeste Zwang zu diesen au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnlichen Vierhebern, die Verse h\u00e4tten ohne jede Schwierigkeit auf drei Kola beschr\u00e4nkt werden k\u00f6nnen. Bei den Versen aus dem \u201cBauer\u201d zeigen das die B1-Varianten, beim \u201cLebensm\u00fcden\u201d w\u00e4re auf das trennende n.j ohne weiteres zu verzichten gewesen, die Gespr\u00e4chssituation ist eindeutig, das\u2014w\u00f6rtlich\u2014: \u201cdamit-er-beantworte-das-was-ichgesagt-hatte\u201d ist schon redundant. Drittens: Das bedeutet, da\u00df der Autor\u2014bzw. in seinen Fu\u00dfstapfen ein Redaktor\u2014diese Vierheber bewu\u00dft geschaffen, da\u00df man sie gewollt hat, da\u00df man sie also als richtig im Redebeginn ansah. Viertens: In den uns \u00fcberkommenen Handschriften aus dem MR sind die Vierheber im Redebeginn nur eine kleine Minderheit und sie sind im Schwinden begriffen: B1 neben R, wohl auch der fast ganz getilgte \u201csitzende Mann\u201d im \u201cLebensm\u00fcden\u201d. Offenbar sind diese Vierheber \u00dcberreste, man hat es unterlassen, sie zu tilgen, sei es aus Fl\u00fcchtigkeit, Bequemlichkeit oder sonst einem uns unbekannten Grund.\n243\n17 FECHT Page 244 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:21 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nF\u00fcnftens: In sp\u00e4teren Texten gibt es keine Vierheber im Redebeginn, zur Zeit unserer Texte sind sie im Schwinden. Wenn sie jemals \u00fcblich waren\u2014und das m\u00fcssen sie gewesen sein, sonst g\u00e4be es sie nicht\u2014, dann mu\u00df das fr\u00fch angesetzt werden. Sechstens: Die Frage lautet also: Gab es fr\u00fche Schriften, in denen Reden h\u00e4ufig waren und in denen Redeanf\u00e4nge irgendwie vermehrt waren? Die Antwort ist eindeutig: in Frage kommen nur die \u201cDramatischen Texte\u201d, \u201cRitualtexte\u201d, \u201cMysterienspiele\u201d oder wie man sie sonst benennen oder unterteilen mag. Vor den jeweils ersten Versen von Reden waren die Sprechenden genannt. Oft ist der Vermerk \u2202d-mdwww-X Y \u201cX spricht zu Y\u201d, doch gibt es auch die Nennung des Sprechenden allein, und \u00fcberdies wissen wir nicht, ob das \u201cX spricht zu Y\u201d tats\u00e4chlich mit zwei Kola gesprochen wurde (mit Einf\u00fcgung des nie geschriebenen n \u201czu\u201d), oder vielleicht nur als Regievermerk \u201csprechen-X-Y\u201d. Da\u00df diese \u201cDramatischen Texte\u201d als Genus sehr alt sind, ist m.E. unzweifelbar.13 Auch die Grabinschriften gab es ja vor dem, was wir Literatur nennen, sie standen einstmals neben den \u201cdramatischen\u201d Texten und Ritualtexten, magischen Texten etc.\u2014eben Texten des \ufb02rj-\u00a2\u00a3b\u2014 als \u00e4lteste Korpora umfangreicher Niederschriften, zu denen sich k\u00f6nigliche und verwaltungstechnische Schriften stellten, z.B. Amtseinf\u00fchrungs- und Amtsbeschreibungstexte, die zusammen mit Elementen anderer Herkunft, v.a. Vater-Sohn-Belehrung, die Ausgangsbasis f\u00fcr die Weisheitslehren bildeten, dem \u00e4ltesten Genus einer vom \u201cSitz im Leben\u201d abgel\u00f6sten, aber noch unproblematischen, auf die Gemeinschaft bezogenen \u201cLiteratur\u201d. So standen schon im AR verschiedene Sorten von Texten nebeneinander, jede Art mit den ihr eigenen Traditionen. Als man in der Ersten Zwischenzeit problematisierende, stark individuelle \u201cAuseinandersetzungsliteratur\u201d schrieb\u2014greifbar in MR- bzw. NRRedaktionen: \u201cLebensm\u00fcder\u201d und \u00e4lteste Teile der \u201cAdmonitions\u201d\u2014 gestaltete man dieses Neue als Diskussionen (toter Mensch\u2013Gott, lebender Mensch\u2013Ba) und konnte sich dabei nur an die Tradition der \u201cDramatischen\u201d Texte anschlie\u00dfen, denn diese bestanden weithin aus Zwiegespr\u00e4chen. Zun\u00e4chst wird man Namen oder Bezeichnungen der Redenden vor dem jeweils ersten Vers der Reden genannt haben, eben nach dem bekannten Vorbild, doch man schrieb ja keine Textb\u00fccher f\u00fcr Auff\u00fchrungen, sondern Lesetexte, und so gerieten die Nennungen der 13 Ich sehe in CT IV, Sp. 312 ein zum Totentext entstelltes Spiel, das helfend und erkl\u00e4rend\nin der 6.

Brunner, in: ZDMG 111 (1961), 439\u201345 (mit \u00e4lterer Literatur), entwickelt eine geistreiche Deutung des Spruches, der ich im einzelnen wie im gesamten nicht immer zu folgen vermag.\n244\n17 FECHT Page 245 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:21 PM\nGerhard Fecht, Der beredte Bauer: die zweite Klage\nRedenden notwendigerweise in das\u2014auch metrische\u2014Gef\u00fcge des Textes hinein. Daraus ergab sich f\u00fcr eine unbekannt lange \u00dcbergangszeit die Regel, da\u00df erste Verse von Reden vier (anfangs wohl auch f\u00fcnf) Kola hatten. Da\u00df man das schlie\u00dflich aufgab, ist leicht verst\u00e4ndlich. Wir fassen Reste in der \u201cBauerngeschichte\u201d und im \u201cLebensm\u00fcden\u201d; in den erst in einer Handschrift des sp\u00e4teren NR \u00fcberlieferten \u201cAdmonitions\u201d ist nat\u00fcrlich keine Spur mehr davon zu finden. Die \u201cLehre f\u00fcr Merikare\u201d hatte keine Diskussionen, als \u201cLehre\u201d folgte sie anderen alten Traditionen, nicht denen der \u201cdramatischen\u201d Texte.14 Wir kehren zur\u00fcck zur ersten Strophe des zweiten Teils der Klage. Isoliert in der Mitte der 7-Verse-Strophe, in Vers 42, wird das Thema dieses zweiten Teils genannt: das Strafen. In den Dreiergruppen vor und nach dem zentralen Vers stehen Beispiele f\u00fcr die schlimmen Zust\u00e4nde, und zwar in einer auf Rensi zunehmend deutlicher zielenden ansteigenden Linie. Jeweils im dritten Vers (also V. 41 und V. 45) ist Rensi angesprochen, erst als \u201cder-f\u00fchren-sollte\u201d, dann sehr spezifisch. Die letzten beiden Verse sto\u00dfen scharf zu, sie konfrontieren Nmtj-n\u221etw mit Rnsj. Sie sind bisher nicht verstanden. Vers 45 endet mit der rhetorischen Frage, ob Rensi \u201cden zu ihm Geh\u00f6renden\u201d (oder: \u201cden, zu dem er geh\u00f6re\u201d) finde. Das n.k des Verses 45 kann ja auch immer n(j).k sein, und das hat die beiden Bedeutungen, da die Nisbe nur die Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit, nicht aber deren Richtung festlegt. Das Verb wf\u00a3 ist wohlbekannt, aber es scheint nicht erkannt zu sein, da\u00df sich wf\u00a3 zu f\u00a3j verh\u00e4lt wie w\u2020z zu \u2020zj, beide mit der Grundbedeutung \u201chochheben\u201d bzw. \u201chochheben\u201d = \u201ctragen\u201d. \u00dcber \u201chochheben\u201d = \u201cbekanntmachen\u201d kommen beide zu positiven wie zu negativen Bedeutungen. Auf die Details kann ich hier nicht eingehen. Es gen\u00fcgt festzustellen, da\u00df in der Lehre des Ptahhotep, D\u00e9v. 72, pPrisse positives wf\u00a3 hat (etwa \u201cr\u00fchmen, positiv sprechen \u00fcber\u201d), L2 dagegen negatives wf\u00a3. Prisse steht dem Archetyp aus dem sp\u00e4ten AR recht nah, hat noch AR-Metrik, L2 ist eine sp\u00e4tere Bearbeitung (cf. die in Anm. 7 genannte Arbeit). Sinuhe B 40 hat schon die negative Variante (etwas zwischen \u201canzeigen\u201d und \u201cverurteilen\u201d), doch aus der Ersten Zwischenzeit haben wir in n\u2202m-wf\u00a3.k-s(j), das Gardiner mit \u201cIt were agreeable that thou shoudst support her\u201d \u00fcbersetzt, einen w\u00fcnschenswert eindeutigen Beleg f\u00fcr die positive Variante aus einem Totenbrief.15 Hier ist unsere Stelle im \u201cBauern\u201d anzu-\n14 Zu\nden Vierhebern siehe auch den Exkurs am Schlu\u00df dieses Beitrags.

Die n\u00e4chste Strophe zu 7 Versen (V. 46\u201352) bildet mit der dann folgenden von 8 Versen eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Einheit: richtig strafen, rechtzeitig strafen\u2014es ist hohe Zeit dazu. Die 7-Verse-Strophe (2, 2+[1+2]) stellt im ersten Vers verk\u00fcrztes Strafen kausal neben langwieriges Unheil. Die Schreibung \u00a2\u2122 f\u00fcr \u00a2w\u2122 ist altert\u00fcmlich, sie schlie\u00dft sich AR-Schreibungen an.16 Die Aussage des Verses 47 d\u00fcrfte die erw\u00fcnschte Wiederherstellung der rechten Ordnung meinen.\u2014Das folgende Verspaar (V. 48\u201349) wurde allgemein mi\u00dfverstanden. Das jrj(w) Ende Vers 48 verkn\u00fcpfte man mit Vers 49: \u201chandle f\u00fcr den Handelnden, um zu veranlassen, da\u00df er handle\u201d. Die Metrik zeigt, da\u00df mit jrj(w) ein Vers endet und damit eine relative Sinneinheit, wie ich das seit den ersten Publikationen zur Metrik stets formuliert habe. So versteht sich leicht, da\u00df der Autor aus seiner Beobachtung \u00fcber die Wirkung einer \u201cverk\u00fcrzten\u201d (unzureichenden) Strafe einerseits und einer \u201cvorbildlichen Tat\u201d andererseits den Schlu\u00df zieht, da\u00df dies die Existenz eines (g\u00f6ttlichen) Gebots erweise, das sich an den richte, der zu handeln habe, damit dieser auch wirklich handle. Das pw nach dem rf ist explikativ: \u201cdas-bedeutetdoch\u201d. Die n\u00e4chsten drei Verse (V. 50\u201352) geben drei Aspekte des Guten, das sich aus dem Befolgen dieses Gottesgebots herleitet. In allen drei Versen steht das richtige Handeln vor einem damit verbundenen anderen Handeln. In den letzten beiden Versen wird das pr\u00e4ventive Handeln gepriesen, das angesichts von Rensi\u2019s Verschleppen durch Schweigen als das extrem rechtzeitige Handeln gesehen wird. Die n\u00e4chste Teilstrophe von 8 Versen (V. 53\u201360) wird gegen Ende etwas schwierig. Die ersten 6 Verse sind aber durchsichtig, wenn man an die erste Klage zur\u00fcckdenkt, die der \u00e4gyptische Leser noch frisch im Kopf hatte, B1 84\u2013102, speziell 92\u201393. Da hie\u00df es, wenn Rensi auf dem See der Maat segle, dann: \u201c\u2026da\u00df-kommen-werden-zu-dir Fische ist-alszur\u00fcckgehaltene(/gebannte), / da\u00df-du-V\u00f6gel erlegen-wirst ist-indem-siefett-sind\u201d (Verspaar), d.h. der Gerechte wird mit Reichtum und Erfolg gesegnet. Wenn der \u201cBauer\u201d nun darum fleht, da\u00df doch ein Augenblick die wirtschaftlichen Mi\u00dferfolge des Rensi in ihr Gegenteil umkehre, so fleht er darum, da\u00df aus dem Ungerechten (dem es ja wirtschaftlich schlecht gehen mu\u00df) wieder ein Gerechter werde. Es folgt in drei Versen die Best\u00e4tigung dieser Deutung, denn an drei Partizipialpaaren wird die 16\nSiehe mein \u201cDie Belehrung des Ba und der Lebensm\u00fcde\u201d, in: FS W.

Zu beachten ist \u201cAugenblick\u201d in Vers 53: es geht wieder um Schnelligkeit, wie oben, Verse 51\u201352. Das abschlie\u00dfende Verspaar erfordert eingehendere Behandlung. Es mu\u00df im Anfang verderbt sein. Was dasteht ist das Wort \u2122nbr(w), das im NR als eine Art Korb bezeugt ist: Jac. Janssen, Commodity Prices, 150, an unserer Stelle aber keinen Sinn ergibt. Ich emendiere in *\u2122nb-bd(w) und denke dabei an b\u2202 \u201cSchmelztiegel\u201d (f\u00fcr Metalle) und \u2122nb, nach Wb. 1, 192, 3\u20134 \u201cverschlie\u00dfen (mit Mund, also auch mit den Z\u00e4hnen), umschlossen halten (vom L\u00f6wen gesagt, mit den Krallen)\u201d, bei Osing, Nominalbildung, Anm. 213 \u201cum-, verschlie\u00dfen; fassen; binden, flechten\u201d; die Grundbedeutung d\u00fcrfte sein \u201cumschlie\u00dfen(d halten), bedecken(d halten)\u201d. Der Tiegel wird, wenn das Metall geschmolzen ist, von einem Arbeiter gehalten, der es ausflie\u00dfen l\u00e4\u00dft. L. Klebs, Die Reliefs des alten Reiches, S. 84f., beschreibt das so: \u201cDer Tiegel wird, da er gl\u00fchend ist, vorsichtig mit zwei Steinen(?) angefa\u00dft. Dann wird eine kleine \u00d6ffnung seitlich am Boden des Tiegels ge\u00f6ffnet, und die schwere, reine Schmelze am Grund des Tiegels flie\u00dft aus. Ein Mann sitzt mit einem St\u00e4bchen in der Hand vor dem Gie\u00dfenden, um die Schlacke zur\u00fcckzuhalten\u201d. Sie bezieht sich auf die Darstellung bei Mereruka (Klebs, l.c., Abb. 68), der hockende Mann scheint nur dort gezeigt (so auch Drenkhahn, Die Handwerker, S. 27 V, VII, XIV, XX). Zweifellos mi\u00dfverstanden ist aber bei Klebs die T\u00e4tigkeit des hockenden Mannes. Er hat gewi\u00df mit dem St\u00e4bchen die \u201ckleine \u00d6ffnung seitlich am Boden des Tiegels ge\u00f6ffnet\u201d, wovon Klebs spricht, ohne auf die Art der \u00d6ffnung einzugehen. Drenkhahn, l.c.: \u201cIm AR hat der runde Tiegel ein seitliches Ausgu\u00dfloch am Boden\u201d; sie verweist auf \u201cdie gefundenen Schmelztiegel, MDAIK 18 (1962), Tf. 3\u20135\u201d. Da\u00df dieses Loch w\u00e4hrend des Schmelzvorgangs provisorisch verschlossen war, ist selbstverst\u00e4ndlich. Es mu\u00dfte vor dem Ausgie\u00dfen rasch ge\u00f6ffnet werden: wie anders als mittels eines St\u00e4bchens, mit dem man den Verschlu\u00df durchstie\u00df? Das mu\u00dfte ein zweiter Mann tun, und zwar direkt \u00fcber dem Gef\u00e4\u00df, in das die Schmelze laufen sollte. Dies und nichts anderes ist bei Mereruka gezeigt. Die Wahl des Verbs \u2122nb d\u00fcrfte mit der besonderen Art zusammenh\u00e4ngen, mit der man den gl\u00fchend hei\u00dfen Tiegel anfa\u00dfte: (Klebs) \u201cvorsichtig mit zwei Steinen(?)\u201d. Der Text geht weiter mit jn-tr-snb.n.k. Das letzte Wort kann nicht snb \u201cgesund werden\u201d sein.

Osing sieht in \u201cSpindel\u201d die Grundbedeutung, was aber wegen \u201cTragstange\u201d unm\u00f6glich ist, denn man kann wohl die \u201cSpindel\u201d als \u201cStange\u201d bezeichnen, nicht aber die Tragstange als \u201cSpindel\u201d.17 Den etymologischen Anschlu\u00df f\u00fcr nb\u00a3 \u201cStange, Stock\u201d m\u00f6chte ich \u00fcber ein Verb *nb\u00a3 in b\u00a3 \u201chacken\u201d suchen, wozu einerseits b\u00a3jj(w), b\u00a3b\u00a3(w) \u201cLoch, H\u00f6hlung\u201d geh\u00f6rt, andererseits wb\u00a3 \u201cbohren, \u00f6ffnen\u201d, sb\u00a3 \u201c\u00f6ffnen, *erhellen, unterrichten\u201d.

Wie snb\u00a3 neben nb\u00a3 so steht snb\u00a3b\u00a3 neben nb\u00a3t, das von P. Lacau\u2013H. Chevrier, Une chapelle d\u2019Hatchepsout \u00e0 Karnak, nicht erkannt worden ist. Dort hei\u00dft es in einer Rede Amuns an die K\u00f6nigin (Block 166, 4.

Das medizinische (pEbers) nb\u00a3 \u201cin manischer Geistesverfassung sein\u201d mag umgekehrt durch nb\u00a3 \u201cSpindel\u201d zumindest beeinflu\u00dft sein. Wenn nb\u00a3b\u00a3 \u201csich drehen, winden\u201d meint, was plausibel wirkt, gilt dasselbe. CT VII 214 i \u00fcbersetzt Osing \u00a3bn.n.j-pt \u201cich habe den Himmel gedreht\u201d. Wegen der dortigen Parallele pn\u2122 wird dieses \u00a3bn nicht hei\u00dfen \u201cin kreiselnde Bewegung versetzen\u201d (wie die Spindel) sondern eher etwas wie \u201cumkippen\u201d. Da\u00df beides von deutschem \u201cdrehen\u201d zur Not abgedeckt werden kann\u2014man w\u00fcrde freilich eher \u201cdrehen\u201d von \u201cumdrehen\u201d differenzierend unterscheiden\u2014setzt den erheblichen Abstraktionsgrad einer modernen Sprache voraus. Wenn man in nb\u00a3 \u201cSpindel\u201d mit Osing eine Ableitung von \u00a3bn \u201cdrehen\u201d (eher: umkippen) und den oben genannten nb\u00a3 und nb\u00a3b\u00a3 sieht, mu\u00df man \u201cSpindel\u201d und \u201cStab\u201d eben, wie gesagt, etymologisch trennen.\u2014Die Etymologien um das Spinnen machen auch sonst Schwierigkeiten. In volkst\u00fcmlichem Sprachgebrauch \u00fcbliches deutsches \u201cspinnen\u201d f\u00fcr \u201cverr\u00fcckt sein\u201d m\u00f6chte man unwillk\u00fcrlich mit der sich drehenden Spindel kombinieren, allenfalls macht das gleichfalls volkst\u00fcmliche \u201csich etwas zurecht spinnen\u201d stutzig. \u201cSpinnen\u201d im Sinne von \u201cverr\u00fcckt sein\u201d kommt letztlich aus nicht so stark abwertendem verk\u00fcrztem \u201cGedanken spinnen\u201d. Ein Beispiel aus einem etymologischen W\u00f6rterbuch: \u201cMoritz lie\u00df nicht ab\u2026 fortw\u00e4hrend zu sinnen und zu spinnen\u201d (Goethe, Ital. Reise, Dez. 1787, das. 27, 182). Dies nur als Beispiel. Im Russischen gebraucht man das Wort f\u00fcr \u201cflechten\u201d im Sinne von \u201csich etwas zurechtdenken\u201d.\n248\n17 FECHT Page 249 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:21 PM\nGerhard Fecht, Der beredte Bauer: die zweite Klage\nWie auch immer die linguistische Entwicklung im einzelnen verlaufen sein mag\u2014man mu\u00df z.B. auch mit der semantischen Einwirkung von Substantiva auf Verba rechnen\u2014, praktisch steht im Ergebnis neben nb\u00a3t \u201cGr\u00fcndungspfahl\u201d snb\u00a3b\u00a3 \u201cGr\u00fcndungspfahl in die Erde eintreiben\u201d (= \u201cgr\u00fcnden\u201d), und ebenso neben nb\u00a3 \u201cStange\u201d snb\u00a3 \u201cdie Stange (in den Tiegel) hineinstecken\u201d.20 Dabei m\u00fcssen wir offenlassen, ob in snb\u00a3 ein kausatives Element sp\u00fcrbar ist. Kausative k\u00f6nnen auch etwa gleichbedeutend mit der Grundform sein.21 Es ist auch gleichg\u00fcltig, ob wir \u00fcbersetzen \u201chast-du-das-St\u00e4bchen-durchsto\u00dfen-lassen\u201d oder \u201chast-du\u2026 -durchgesto\u00dfen\u201d. In Bildreden pflegt der Angesprochene als Handelnder zu fungieren, auch wenn ein Kausativ angebracht w\u00e4re.\u2014Die Schwierigkeit und Verderbnis der beiden zuletzt er\u00f6rterten Verse ist gewi\u00df Folge davon, da\u00df in einer Bildrede Fachsprache gebraucht war und mit Vorstellungen gearbeitet wurde, die Spezialisten unter den Handwerkern vertraut waren, aber kaum dem Schreiber-Kopisten. Die \u00dcbersetzung ergibt sich nun und bringt den Gedanken zum Ausdruck, da\u00df es h\u00f6chste Zeit sei zu handeln, weil sonst ein Ungl\u00fcck eintritt, wie es im Bild das Erstarren der Schmelze im Tiegel w\u00e4re. In der n\u00e4chsten Teilstrophe von 8 Versen (V. 61\u201368: 1+2+1, 1+2+1), die mit der nachfolgenden (V. 69\u201375: 1+2+1, 2+1) eine relative Einheit bildet, geht es zun\u00e4chst gem\u00e4\u00df den Stichw\u00f6rtern im jeweils ersten Vers um den Mi\u00dfbrauch der H\u00e4rte, der Rensi angelastet wird, dann um den Mi\u00dfbrauch der Milde. Dabei folgt in der ersten Teilstrophe nach der Aussage \u00fcber die H\u00e4rte eine erg\u00e4nzende \u00fcber die Milde, in der zweiten Teilstrophe auf die Aussage \u00fcber die Milde eine solche \u00fcber die H\u00e4rte. \u2014Man sieht, beide Teilstrophen sind kunstvoll verschr\u00e4nkt, doch dies ist bei weitem nicht alles. Zugleich wird nun, durch Amphibolien verdeckt, mit dem Eingreifen von gef\u00fcrchteten Todes-Gottheiten gegen Rensi gedroht. Und diese Drohungen sind tats\u00e4chlich das Hauptthema, denn erstens f\u00fchren sie das Thema \u201cdas Strafen\u201d\u2014nun Bestrafen Rensis\u2014weiter, zweitens sind die letzten drei Verse der ersten Teilstrophe nur unter dem Aspekt der Drohung gegen Rensi verst\u00e4ndlich, und dasselbe gilt f\u00fcr die letzte Strophe des Zweiten Teils, die als n\u00e4chstes anschlie\u00dft (V. 76\u201382). Zugleich ist der Text beider Teilstrophen 18 Zum\nWortgebrauch vgl. Wb. 4, 178, 7\u20139.

S. 116. 19 Bei\n249\n17 FECHT Page 250 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:21 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nmitbestimmt von dem Willen des Autors, die beiden Amphibolien zu verdeutlichen: beide Schl\u00fcssel-Verben sind je zweimal gebraucht, einmal in der verschleiernden Bedeutung da, wo gedroht wird, einmal in der dort gemeinten zweiten Bedeutung au\u00dferhalb des engsten Kreises der Drohungen, der die Verse 64\u201368 umgreift. Nun zum einzelnen. Vers 61 ist neutral, Rensi ist stark und m\u00e4chtig. Die beiden eng anschlie\u00dfenden n\u00e4chsten Verse wenden das ins Negative: Mi\u00dfbrauch. Im vierten wird daraus konkludiert, da\u00df Rensi dem Boten des \u221entj, des Krokodil-Todesd\u00e4mons gleiche (twt). Dieser schreckliche \u221entj ist gut bezeugt,22 in ihm kulminiert der schreckliche Aspekt des Krokodils, wobei zugleich\u2014je nach Situation\u2014ein Hinweis auf Osiris (Wb. 3, 308, 6\u20137) mitklingen kann. An unserer Stelle weist das \u201cBote\u201d auf Osiris, denn Boten des \u221entj, des unmittelbar zupackenden Krokodils sind wenig wahrscheinlich, w\u00e4hrend die Boten des Osiris ja wohlbekannt sind. Dennoch steht im Vordergrund hier sicherlich das grausige Krokodil. Das vielseitige Wort twt kommt sechs Verse weiter in der zweiten Teilstrophe nochmals vor, und zwar keine nominale oder sonstige Ableitung des Verbs, sondern dasselbe Adjektivverb. In Wb. 5, 257 sind Bedeutungen des Wortes in der auch im \u201cBauer\u201d vorliegenden Konstruktion mit der Pr\u00e4position n aufgelistet: a\u2013b \u201cgleichen, \u00e4hnlich sein\u201d, c \u201cgeb\u00fchren, angemessen sein, zustehen\u201d (z.B. twt-n.f j\u00a3w \u201cLobpreis ist geb\u00fchrend f\u00fcr ihn\u201d). Diese Konstruktion haben wir in Vers 70, wo mit Selbstjustiz gedroht wird: 2 twt-\u2020\u00a3wt n-jwtj-j\u221ewt.f \u201cgeb\u00fchrendist-das-Wegnehmen f\u00fcr-den-der-seinen-Besitz-nicht-hat\u201d. Wenn wir nun diese Bedeutungsschattierung des twt n- in Vers 64 einsetzen, verstehen wir: \u201cGeb\u00fchrend-bist-du f\u00fcr-den-Boten des-\u221entj\u201d, d.h. etwa: du hast es verdient, vom Todesboten abgeholt zu werden. Auf diese mit twt bewerkstelligte Amphibolie folgt der Vers 65, mit dem eine neue Versgruppe von vier Versen beginnt: mk-tw-sw\u00a3j.tj \u00a2rnbt-jdw \u201cSiehe-du-hast-\u00fcbertroffen die-Herrin-der-Pestilenz\u201d, eine Aussage, die auf der Linie der voranstehenden liegt: \u201cDu-gleichst demBoten des-Krokodil-Todesd\u00e4mons\u201d. Die die Teilstrophe abschlie\u00dfenden drei Verse, die ohne Zweifel Bezug nehmen auf Sachmet als die \u201cHerrin der Pestilenz\u201d, schlie\u00dfen sich mit \u201c\u00fcbertreffen\u201d aber zu keinem evidenten Sinn zusammen: \u201cgibt-es-nichts-f\u00fcr-dich, so-gibt-es-nichts-f\u00fcrsie\u201d etc. Wer Sachmet \u00fcbertrifft, ist nicht abh\u00e4ngig davon, ob \u201ces etwas 22\nVgl.

Das Verb sw\u00a3j \u00a2r- hei\u00dft zun\u00e4chst einfach r\u00e4umlich \u201cvorbeigehen an-\u201d (\u201cfern machen\u201d), und daraus entwickelte sich einerseits \u201c\u00fcbertreffen\u201d, andererseits \u201cnicht ber\u00fccksichtigen, nicht hinreichend beachten, sich nicht k\u00fcmmern um\u2026\u201d u.\u00e4. (aus: \u201cachtlos vorbeigehen, statt stehen zu bleiben und sich zu k\u00fcmmern um\u2026\u201d). Diese zweite Bedeutung hatten wir in Vers 63 \u201cdie-Milde-ist-an-dir-vor\u00fcbergegangen\u201d oder \u201c\u2026hat-sich-nicht-umdich-gek\u00fcmmert\u201d, \u201c\u2026dich-nicht-ber\u00fccksichtigt\u201d, das hei\u00dft: sie ist an dir vorbeigegangen, ohne dich zu beeinflussen, in einem deutschen Idiom: sie hat dich links liegen lassen. Wenn wir diese Bedeutung einsetzen in Vers 65, \u00fcbersetzen wir: \u201cSiehe-du-hast-nicht-hinreichendber\u00fccksichtigt die-Herrin-der-Pestilenz\u201d, du hast bei deinen b\u00f6sen Taten nicht daran gedacht, da\u00df diese r\u00e4chend \u00fcber dich kommen wird. Die folgenden Verse sind nun durchsichtig: \u201cgibt-es-nichts-f\u00fcr-dich, sogibt-es-nichts-f\u00fcr-sie\u201d, d.h. wenn du nicht raubst, dann raubt sie dich nicht; \u201cgibt-es-nichts-gegen-sie, so-gibt-es-nichts-gegen-dich\u201d, d.h. wenn ihr nichts anzulasten ist (scil. die T\u00f6tung des Rensi), dann deshalb, weil dir nichts anzulasten ist; \u201cwenn-du-es-nicht-tust, so-tut-sie-esnicht\u201d, d.h. wenn du nicht gewaltt\u00e4tig bist, so ist sie nicht gewaltt\u00e4tig (gegen dich). Der Krokodilgott \u221entj und die L\u00f6weng\u00f6ttin Sachmet sind hier Racheg\u00f6tter f\u00fcr Verbrechen gegen die Maat, und das sind dieselben Gottheiten, die zusammen mit dem distanziert nachstehenden Pta\u00a2 in dem Zitat \u00e4lterer Literaturbruchst\u00fccke in Admonitions 5, 7\u20139, wo die Sinnhaftigkeit des Opfers an G\u00f6tter negiert wird, als groteske Opferempf\u00e4nger aufgef\u00fchrt sind.23 Der Grundgedanke ist nat\u00fcrlich derselbe wie in Merikare E 46\u201347 jrj-m\u00a3\u2122t w\u00a3\u00a2.k tp-t\u00a3 \u201cTue-die-Maat, damit-dudauerst auf-Erden!\u201d oder wie in der dritten Klage des \u201cBauern\u201d, B1 176\u2013 77 z\u00a3w-tkn-n\u00a2\u00a2 mrj-w\u00a3\u00a2 / mj-\u2202d-\u2020\u00a3w-pw n-fnd jrt-m\u00a3\u2122t \u201cH\u00fcte-dich-vordem-Nahen-der-Ewigkeit, w\u00fcnsche-zu-dauern, / gem\u00e4\u00df-dem-(Sprich)Wort-\u2018Luft f\u00fcr-die-Nase ist-das-Tun-der-Maat\u2019\u201d, wo diesseitiges und jenseitiges Leben nicht mehr zu trennen sind. 23 S.\nmein \u201c\u00c4gyptische Zweifel am Sinn des Opfers\u201d, in: Z\u00c4S 100 (1973), 6\u201316.

Wenn wir die Verse 53\u201355 wieder ins Auge fassen, sehen wir, wie zun\u00e4chst wirtschaftlicher Mi\u00dferfolg des Rensi als automatische Konsequenz vorausgesetzt wird, und wie dann (V. 64\u201365) die Bestrafung zur Frage nach Leben und Tod wird. Wenn dieser Automatismus versagt, bleibt der Ausgleich aus\u2014 oder: in\u2014der postmortalen Existenz: Am Ende der neunten Klage will der \u201cBauer\u201d weggehen, um sich (im Jenseits) bei Anubis zu beschweren, der sch\u00fctzend hinter ihm steht, wenn man seinen Namen \u221ewj.n-Jnpw -\u00b4 \u00b4(Aussprache des NR: *\u221eawinanapa/i) ernstnimmt. Auch dies ist eine Drohung, die an die Todes-Boten denken l\u00e4\u00dft.\u2014Auffallend ist die Deutlichkeit, mit der auf die Amphibolien hingewiesen wird, eben durch die aufgezeigte Doppelung der beteiligten Verben. Das best\u00e4rkt den ohnehin naheliegenden Schlu\u00df, da\u00df f\u00fcr den Autor beide Interpretationsebenen wichtig und richtig waren und da\u00df diese Zweischichtigkeit als sachliche Identit\u00e4t im Sinne von Kausalit\u00e4t realisiert werden mu\u00df. Das hei\u00dft, da\u00df in der Meinung des Autors derjenige, der sich dem Wesen gef\u00e4hrlichd\u00e4monischer G\u00f6tter angleicht, diesen G\u00f6ttern selbst als Opfer anheimf\u00e4llt. Das ist eine fr\u00fche Form eines uns wohlbekannten mittelalterlichen, aber im Grunde nie veraltenden Motivs: des Paktes mit dem Teufel. Die zweite Teilstrophe (7 Verse, V. 69\u201375) ist in der neuen \u00dcbersetzung nun wohl durchsichtig. Der \u201cHerr-des-Brots\u201d ist der Patron der Klientel24 (vgl. oben V. 15\u201319), zu der wohl auch der R\u00e4uber Nemtinacht geh\u00f6rt. Das vom \u201cBauern\u201d geforderte Recht auf Selbstjustiz f\u00fcr den Beraubten ist zwar zun\u00e4chst die Reaktion darauf, da\u00df Nemtinachts Raub ein vorget\u00e4uschter Akt berechtigter Selbstjustiz war. Rensi ist milde nur gegen\u00fcber dem R\u00e4uber, in dessen Interesse er hart ist, er unterst\u00fctzt also das nicht durch Not sondern durch Gier motivierte Rauben, das unbedingt angeklagt werden mu\u00df, weil ein Richter, der das nicht tut, sich der selbsts\u00fcchtigen Beihilfe schuldig macht. Demgegen\u00fcber wird die Selbstjustiz des Beraubten als passend, geb\u00fchrend bezeichnet. Das wirkt immerhin recht bemerkenswert, denn in \u00c4gypten war zumindest in der Theorie doch wohl der Prozess das einzig legale. Die Stelle wirkt revolution\u00e4r oder doch in einem revolution\u00e4ren Sinn ausweitbar: principiis obsta. Die letzte Strophe des zweiten Teils der eigentlichen Klage, der dann noch der Schlu\u00dfappell folgt, umfa\u00dft wieder 7 Verse (V. 76\u201382). Die erste Strophe dieses zweiten Teils (V. 33\u201345) hatte den Aufbau 2+1,1,1+2; in ihr wurde Rensi mit Nemtinacht konfrontiert. 24 Englisch\n252\n\u201cLord\u201d hat bekanntlich die Grundbedeutung \u201cBrotwart\u201d.\n17 FECHT Page 253 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:21 PM\nGerhard Fecht, Der beredte Bauer: die zweite Klage\nDie letzte Strophe nun hat den Aufbau 2+1+2,2; in ihr wird Rensi mit dem K\u00f6nig konfrontiert. Metrisch haben beide Strophen (au\u00dfer der Siebenzahl) den isolierten, betonten Einzelvers gemeinsam, der einmal zwischen zwei Dreiergruppen, einmal zwischen zwei Verspaaren steht. Dieser Einzelvers gab als Vers 42 das Thema an, das auch in der letzten Strophe noch g\u00fcltig ist, wo er in Vers 78 das Thema der zweiten Ebene angibt: Strafen seitens des K\u00f6nigs. In den beiden um den Mittelvers gruppierten Verspaaren (V. 76\u201377, V. 79\u201380) ist von Rensi gesagt, da\u00df er ein Steuermann ist. Im Gliederungsaufbau erkennt man eine Wiederaufnahme des SteuerMotivs der ersten Strophe der Klage (V. 7, V. 10), also ein zentrierendes Element. Sachlich ist die Aussage insofern richtig, als Rensi in seiner Eigenschaft als hoher Beamter leitet, also steuert. Weiterhin ist zweierlei gesagt. Erstens, da\u00df das Schiff vom Kurs abgleitet, und (damit) Unheil-Unrecht in dem Bereich (den Angelegenheiten) des Rensi geschaffen wird. Zweitens wird gesagt, da\u00df das Gesicht des Steuermanns nach vorn gerichtet ist, was auch stimmt, denn der Steuermann schaut nach vorne, zum Bug (w\u00a3\u2202t oder \u00a2\u00a3t) des Schiffes hin, wo der Lotse (/Pilot) steht, der den Kurs angibt, dem Steuermann durch Handzeichen oder Zuruf anzeigt, wie zu steuern ist. Dieser Lotse kann in unserem Fall nur der K\u00f6nig sein, der das Staatsschiff lenkt.25 Im herausgehobenen Mittelvers (V. 78) steht nun, da\u00df der K\u00f6nig m-\u221ent(j) sei. Da \u221ent(j) ein gel\u00e4ufiger Ausdruck f\u00fcr den vorderen Teil des Palastes ist, in dem er u.a. Beamte empfing26, wird man das mit \u201cHaus\u201d determinierte Wort zun\u00e4chst eben als \u201cPalast\u201d interpretieren: \u201cder-K\u00f6nig istim-Palast\u201d. Im Zusammenhang der Strophe ist diese Interpretation des auff\u00e4llig plazierten Mittelverses der 5 Verse einnehmenden Konfrontierung des Rensi mit dem K\u00f6nig aber doch sehr schwach, und man erkennt rasch, da\u00df hier wieder eine Amphibolie steckt: \u201cim Palast\u201d ist eine nichtssagende, harmlose Feststellung, \u201cvorne\u201d, wie man genausogut \u00fcbersetzen kann\u2014m-\u221ent(j) \u201cvorne\u201d kann auch mit dem \u201cHaus\u201d determiniert werden\u2014, ist dagegen sinnvoll, freilich keineswegs harmlos.

Es gibt dann zwei M\u00f6glichkeiten, entweder ist Rensi illoyal, er verwickelt den K\u00f6nig ohne dessen Wissen und entgegen dessen Weisungen in seine eigenen \u00fcblen Machenschaften, oder aber: der K\u00f6nig ist schuld. F\u00fcr den \u201cBauer\u201d konnte nur die erste dieser M\u00f6glichkeiten die zutreffende sein: Rensi schaut auf den K\u00f6nig, tut aber dennoch Unrecht. Er wird als Verr\u00e4ter \u00fcberf\u00fchrt und schwer bestraft werden. Das ist die handgreiflichste Drohung, sie bricht zwar nicht aus dem Unbegreiflich-G\u00f6ttlichen r\u00e4chend in das irdische Leben ein, sie kommt aus dem diesseitig-realen G\u00f6ttlichen und ist vernichtend.27 Hier sei eine Randglosse eingeschaltet. In der \u00e4gyptologischen Literatur wird nicht selten die Meinung vertreten, da\u00df in der \u201cBauerngeschichte\u201d Humor und Ironie eine betr\u00e4chtliche Rolle spielten. Ich bin nicht dieser Ansicht. An unserer Stelle freilich kann man derartiges vermuten, wenn auch nicht auf der Ebene der Argumentation, sondern auf einer zweiten Ebene dahinter. Da, wo die Drohung in gef\u00e4hrlicher Weise den K\u00f6nig einbezieht, stellt sich f\u00fcr den orientierten Leser eine Realit\u00e4t her, die keineswegs bedrohlich ist. Der K\u00f6nig hat ja tats\u00e4chlich dem Rensi Weisung gegeben, den \u201cBauern\u201d hinzuhalten, um recht viele Reden aus ihm herauszulocken. Der gebildete Leser hatte gewi\u00df Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr das literarische Interesse des K\u00f6nigs, durch die Wahl seiner Lekt\u00fcre bewies er ja das gleiche Interesse, und f\u00fcr den Unterhalt des \u201cBauern\u201d und seiner Familie war auf das beste gesorgt. Der Leser wird an diesem geistreichen Spiel mit den beiden Ebenen seine Freude gehabt haben. Die Mehrschichtigkeit erinnert an die Amphibolien. Und noch eine grammatische Bemerkung. In der gesamten Klage gibt es keinen Adverbialsatz mit dem eigentlich obligatorischen jw-; die Schlu\u00dfermahnung ist frei von Adverbials\u00e4tzen. Die Ausnahme sind die Verse 76\u201380, die Konfrontation mit dem K\u00f6nig, denn hier steht jwdreimal, zweimal in einem Hauptsatz, dem ein Umstandssatz folgt, also da, wo allenfalls ein zweites Tempus erwartet w\u00fcrde. Die letzten beiden Verse der Strophe (V. 81\u201382) geh\u00f6ren vielleicht noch in den \u201cK\u00f6nigs\u201d-Zusammenhang, \u201cvielleicht\u201d im Sinne einer m\u00f6glichen und naheliegenden, in der Sprache zwingend vorgegebenen, Amphibolie. Der erste dieser Verse ist besonders merkw\u00fcrdig mi\u00dfverstanden worden, denn \u00a3wj \u201ceinreichen, \u00fcberreichen, zustellen\u201d steht im Wb. 1, 15, 10\u201311; vgl. au\u00dferdem etwa: Hayes, Late M.K. Papyrus, S. 35f.; Helck, Z\u00c4S 85 (1960), S. 32 (mit Liter.); wdnw nimmt Bezug auf 27 In\nB1 244\u2013246 (4.

Auch hier ist mit dem \u201czweiten\u201d Rechtsfall gewi\u00df der gegen den Richter gemeint. Das scheint bislang nicht verstanden.\n254\n17 FECHT Page 255 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:21 PM\nGerhard Fecht, Der beredte Bauer: die zweite Klage\nVers 9, wo Rensi als \u201cSenklotschnur, die das Gewicht tr\u00e4gt\u201d apostrophiert wird (Gewicht = wdnw). Der Adressat der Petition, Rensi, der die Norm verk\u00f6rpert, ist als solcher nicht mehr da, denn die Norm ist ja zerst\u00f6rt, die \u201cSenklotschnur, die das Gewicht tr\u00e4gt\u201d, ist zerrissen. Bei Vers 82 denkt man an Ptahhotep, D\u00e9v. 273/4, wo es auch um die richtige Einstellung zu Bittstellern geht. Das pronominale Subjekt in k\u00a3.tw kann sich auf \u201cdie Leute\u201d beziehen, aber auch auf den K\u00f6nig, Verweis auf den K\u00f6nig mit tw \u201cman\u201d gibt es im \u201cBauern\u201d. Wenn der K\u00f6nig gemeint ist, dann mu\u00df \u201cjener-da\u201d Rensi sein, wenn \u201cdie Leute\u201d gemeint sind, d\u00fcrfte dabei eher an den \u201cBauern\u201d zu denken sein. Der Vers ist im Grunde auch amphibolisch, und da die Aufmerksamkeit des K\u00f6nigs peinlicher f\u00fcr Rensi eingesch\u00e4tzt worden sein d\u00fcrfte, wird das Gemeinte eben der K\u00f6nig sein. *** Nun folgt die abschlie\u00dfende Ermahnung, rhetorisch die peroratio. Sie ist zweigeteilt, sieben Verse (V. 83\u201389) zielen auf Rensi und die Beamten, sechs Verse (V. 90\u201395) zielen auf Rensi und den \u201cBauern\u201d, zusammen macht das also dreizehn Verse aus. Rensi soll eine Zufluchtsst\u00e4tte gegen die Gefahren sein, die er selbst heraufbeschworen hat. Lexikalisch zeigt Vers 83 keine Schwierigkeiten. Was die Beschaffenheit der jbw-\u201cZufluchtsst\u00e4tte\u201d gegen Krokodile angeht, sagen einige Verse aus einem Lobpreis Amuns aus \u25caern\u2248\u2013 Gardiner, HO 1, pl. 38,2 vo., 4/5 immerhin ein weniges aus. Bei Assmann, \u00c4g. Hymnen und Gebete ist dieser Text nicht ber\u00fccksichtigt. In H. Brunners gehaltvoller Besprechung von HO (in: BiOr 15 [1958], S. 195\u201397) sind die ersten beiden Verse \u00fcbersetzt, der dritte blieb unverstanden\u2014das Fremdwort dprw nicht erkannt\u2014und daher falsch \u00fcbersetzt.28 2 2 3 3\n\u00a3\u221e-sw r-jbw-mn\u221e \u00a2r-m\u00a3st ntj-\u221entj \u2020\u00a3jj-dpjjw dprw r\u00a3.sn-wn(w) k\u00a3p.n m-\ufb02nw.f n\u00b4-sn\u2202.j-n.w\nMeine \u00dcbersetzung: 2 N\u00fctzlicher-ist-er als-ein-trefflicher-jbw-Schutzbau 2 auf-der-Uferbank des-Krokodils. 3 Die-Krokodile-packen die-Beutetiere mit-offenen-M\u00e4ulern, 28 Das\nbisher ungedeutete dprw (Determ.: Krokodil) mu\u00df Lehnwort aus dem Semitischen sein: hebr\u00e4isch trp . rei\u00dfen (vom Raubtier), t\u2019 . r\u00e9p\u00e1h (vom Raubwild) zerrissenes Tier, t\u00e4r\u00e4p .

Die Metathesis zu dpr kann von dem Wort f\u00fcr \u201cKrokodil\u201d beeinflu\u00dft sein, darauf weist auch das Determinativ.\n255\n17 FECHT Page 256 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:21 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\n3 doch-unser-Versteck ist-in-ihm, und-ich-f\u00fcrchte-mich-nicht-vor-ihnen.29\nDaraus ist zu entnehmen, da\u00df man vom jbw aus den Kampf der Krokodile ungef\u00e4hrdet betrachten konnte. Das setzt H\u00f6he und einen soliden Unterbau voraus. Da Holz selten und teuer war, kam als Baumaterial nur Lehm, Schlamm in Betracht, zumal man diese jbw\u2019s sicher m\u00f6glichst bei allen gef\u00e4hrdeten Anlegestellen errichtete. Vermutlich waren es hinreichend hohe, solide runde Turmst\u00fcmpfe aus Lehm mit eingelassenen Trittl\u00f6chern und Handgriffen zum Ersteigen, mit einer umwallten Plattform oben. In der \u201cBauerngeschichte\u201d kommen diese Schutzbauten noch in der 3., 4. und 8. Klage vor. Vers 85 ist schwierig. Zun\u00e4chst zu \u2122t-jm.f: die Bedeutung \u201cein Glied von ihm (selbst)\u201d ist eindeutig, s. A.H. Gardiner, AEO 1, S. 109* (einige Belege aus PT, Dyn. 11 und ein unklarer aus Edfu; dazu noch Dyn. 11, Cl\u00e8re\u2013Vandier, TPPI, \u00a7 32). Die Konzentration der sp\u00e4rlichen Belege auf die sp\u00e4te Dyn. 11 (drei von vier oder f\u00fcnf Belegen, alle nach der Reichseinigung des MR) ist sehr auff\u00e4llig; vielleicht liegt herakleopolitanische Tradition aus der Zwischenzeit vor, die Belegverteilung erinnert etwas an die der oben S. 240 besprochenen rhetorischen Floskel. Entscheidend f\u00fcr das Verst\u00e4ndnis ist das ungedeutete Wort t\u00a3mw. In B1 ist es mit \u201cSchlange/Wurm\u201d determiniert, in R mit \u201cPflanze\u201d (und Pluralstrichen). Ein etymologischer Anschlu\u00df l\u00e4\u00dft sich\u2014lautlich und auch semasiologisch\u2014bei \u2020\u00a3m \u201cbedecken, sich bedecken, /verh\u00fcllen\u201d finden mit den Ableitungen \u201cBinde, Nachsicht, Vorhaut\u201d, und dazu kopt. S twlM \u201cbeschmieren, sich bedecken, /Verunreinigung\u201d; dazu dann tnm (geschr. dnm) aus griechischer Zeit \u201cSchmutz\u201d. Die Konsonantenfolge n-m wechselt ja gern dissimilatorisch mit l-m, und da\u00df \u00a3 f\u00fcr l stehen kann, ist bekannt. Das griechische dnm \u201cSchmutz\u201d ist Schreibung f\u00fcr eine Substantivbildung vom Stamm \u2020\u00a3m aus, wahrscheinlich der substantivierte Infinitiv. Damit kann aber unser t\u00a3mw nicht einfach identisch sein, auch abgesehen von dem auslautenden -w; es hat wohl die Entwicklung von \u2020 zu t mit ihm gemeinsam, doch die Determinierungen (Schlange/Wurm und Pflanze) weisen auf eine semantische Spezialisierung: etwas, das man als pflanzlich oder als tierisch ansehen kann. Das pa\u00dft nun sehr gut zu \u201cSchimmel\u201d, und dies wiederum stimmt zu unserem Kontext, denn hier stehen sich \u201cMann\u201d und \u201cein Glied von ihm\u201d gegen\u00fcber, und es geht um Verderbnis, die das Ganze \u00fcberziehen wird. Daher die vorgeschlagene \u00dcbersetzung, in der gesagt wird, da\u00df von einem verderbten Teil (Zunge) aus dessen Ganzes (Mann) verdorben werden kann, so wie 29\nVgl. Leidener Amunshymnen, III 19: \u201ces-gibt-keine-Kraft des-Krokodils (\u221entj), wennsein-Name-ausgesprochen wird\u201d.\n256\n17 FECHT Page 257 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:21 PM\nGerhard Fecht, Der beredte Bauer: die zweite Klage\ndas bei Verschimmelung ja tats\u00e4chlich geschieht. \u00c4hnliche Aussagen zu diesem Thema gibt es bekanntlich, z.B. \u201cLehre des Ani\u201d, Max. 34: whn.tw-rm\u2020 \u00a2r-ns.f \u201cder-Mensch-wird-zerst\u00f6rt von/wegen-seinerZunge\u201d; in der \u201cLehre des Amenope\u201d handeln zehn Stellen von der Zunge.30\u2014Die Syntax des Verses 85 ist verk\u00fcrzt aus t\u00a3mw-pw n-z\u2019 t\u00a3mw-\u2122t-jm.f, wie man das aus Vergleichen kennt (Gardiner, Eg.Gr. \u00a7 506,4). Nun folgt der Abschnitt Vers 86\u201389 mit dem Bezug Rensi\u2013Richter. Vers 87 wurde in j\u00fcngerer Zeit noch falsch \u00fcbersetzt, doch sind die beiden Schl\u00fcsselw\u00f6rter inzwischen eindeutig nachweisbar: \u2122\u2202j steht im Wb. 1, 240, 3 mit der etwas unklaren \u00dcbersetzung \u201creinigen\u201d, weiterhin deutlicher bei Junker, G\u00eeza 11, 160f.; Newberry, Beni Hasan 2, 6; Helck, Das Bier, 26; und v.a. CT VI, 283 s, wo \u2122\u2202j zusammen mit mndm genannt ist: jw.f-r\u221ew rn / n-mndm-pw \u2122\u2202\u2202w-jm.f \u201cer-wei\u00df den-Namen / jenes-Korbs, in-dem-er-geworfelt-wird.31 Zu mndm: P. Posener-Kri\u00e9ger, Les Archives\u2026 N\u00e9ferirkar\u00ea-Kaka\u00ef 2, 374 (d), wo mndm als alter Konsonantenbestand gesichert ist. Das Verspaar ist nun verst\u00e4ndlich: nur wenn Rensi nicht selbst l\u00fcgt, kann er die Beamten kontrollieren, wobei das Bild des Worfelns als des Trennens von Brauchbarem und Unbrauchbarem mit einem gro\u00dfen Korb gebraucht wird. Das n\u00e4chste Verspaar weist darauf hin, da\u00df gerade das L\u00fcgen, das Rensi dringend zu vermeiden hat, den Richter-Beamten aus Bequemlichkeit so lieb ist. Wir denken an den Passus vor der Ersten Klage (B1 75\u201380), wo die Richter als Beisitzer dem Rensi eine sehr bequeme, aber l\u00fcgenhafte Entschuldigung f\u00fcr den \u00dcberfall des Nemtinacht auf den \u201cBauern\u201d anboten. Diese Richter m\u00fcssen in dem Korb-Sieb geworfelt werden, wie das im Bilde gesagt ist, sonst greift die moralische Verschimmelung um sich. Schlie\u00dflich noch die letzten Verse, in denen der \u201cBauer\u201d f\u00fcr sich selbst bittet und fordert. Es scheint ihm widersinnig, da\u00df Rensi, der kundigste aller Menschen, nun gerade von seiner, des \u201cBauern\u201d, Angelegenheit nichts wissen sollte, da\u00df er also nicht \u00fcber die wirklichen Begebenheiten informiert sein sollte?32 Dann fordert er ihn in zwei Verspaaren auf\u2014wie wissend oder unwissend Rensi auch sein mag\u2014, er 30 Es sei noch verwiesen auf den Artikel in\nL\u00c4 und den Aufsatz von S.

Einen schl\u00fcssigen zweiten Beleg f\u00fcr \u221em m- kann ich hier nicht darlegen (\u201cfalsch orientiert sein \u00fcber etwas\u201d).\n257\n17 FECHT Page 258 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:21 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nsolle die ihm als Richter und gro\u00dfem Herrn zukommende Retterfunktion aus\u00fcben. Hier sind drei Stellen bisher nicht richtig erfa\u00dft. Das jw(jw)\u2014es mu\u00df PsP. sein\u2014kann nicht \u201cschifflos sein\u201d meinen, denn der \u201cBauer\u201d hat nicht \u201ceinen Weg, der schifflos ist\u201d. Vielmehr ist zu \u00fcbersetzen \u201cabschneiden, abtrennen\u201d (Wb. 1, 48,1). Es geht um den \u201cabgeschnittenen Weg\u201d, den der \u201cBauer\u201d hat, d.h. er steht auf einem Weg, dessen Fortsetzung von der Flut weggesp\u00fclt ist, auf einem Dammweg also. Dieses Bild mu\u00df real oder imagin\u00e4r jedem \u00c4gypter pr\u00e4sent gewesen sein. Das seltene \ufb02dr im letzten Vers hat G. Burkard behandelt in seinem Textkritische Untersuchungen zu \u00e4g. Weisheitslehren (Wiesbaden, 1977), S. 193.33 Er meint f\u00e4lschlich, das Wort sei nur Ptahhotep, D\u00e9v. 10 (pPrisse) belegt. Dort steht s\u2202r-n.f \ufb02dr(w) r\u2122w-nb. Stattdessen haben (D\u00e9v. 15) L2 s\u2202r-jb rmj(w) r\u2122w-nb und C s\u2202r-jb wrd(w) r\u2122w-nb. Da\u00df \ufb02dr ein altert\u00fcmliches Wort ist, das L2 und C, beide wohl Dyn. 18 (letzte Abschrift!), nicht mehr kennen, ist evident. Umso interessanter ist es, da\u00df das Wort im \u201cBauern\u201d vorkommt. Papyrus Prisse konnte ich\u2014in seinem Archetyp, nicht etwa die letzte, uns zuf\u00e4llig erhaltene Kopie\u2014in das Alte Reich datieren, sei es in Teilen, sei es als Ganzes.34 Burkard meint, die Bedeutung k\u00f6nne aus dem Zusammenhang mit dem Determinativ des \u201cschlechten Vogels\u201d ann\u00e4hernd erschlossen werden. Ich zitiere: \u201cEs ist eine bekannte Erscheinung, da\u00df man mit zunehmendem Alter oft weniger Schlafbed\u00fcrfnis hat, man \u201cschl\u00e4ft schlecht\u201d. Das ist m.E. auch hier gemeint, als Bedeutung ist daher \u201cschwerfallen, schlecht sein\u201d o.\u00e4. anzunehmen; s\u2202r ist Infinitiv, \ufb02dr Pseudopartizip; \u2026\u201d. Ich glaube nicht, da\u00df dieser Schlu\u00df richtig ist. Ich bin sicher, da\u00df auch Burkard zur\u00fcckhaltender gewesen w\u00e4re, h\u00e4tte er sich an die \u201cBauerngeschichte\u201d erinnern k\u00f6nnen. Denn dort ist auch ein solcher schlichter erster R\u00fcckschlu\u00df konkreter eingebunden und damit aussichtsreicher. Wenn der \u201cBauer\u201d in seiner Schlu\u00dfermahnung zu Rensi sagt \ufb02dr.k-wj, so ist die Vermutung, da\u00df er damit etwas wie \u201crette mich\u201d oder \u201crette mich heraus\u201d meint, sehr naheliegend. Und tats\u00e4chlich sind wir damit der Grundbedeutung des Wortes sehr nahe. Die \u00e4gyptischen W\u00f6rter f\u00fcr \u201cretten\u201d haben auch immer eine zweite Bedeutung: n\u00a2m a) (fort)nehmen, rauben b) retten; \u00dfdj a) (fort)nehmen b) retten; \u2122w\u00a3j a) (fort)nehmen, rauben b) versorgen (wohl aus *retten).35 Die Grundbedeutung d\u00fcrfte\u2014 grob gesch\u00e4tzt\u2014einfaches \u201cnehmen\u201d sein, daraus Weiterentwicklung in 33\nSp\u00e4ter, aber mit demselben Deutungsversuch, in einem Aufsatz \u201cPtahhotep und das Alter\u201d in: Z\u00c4S 115 (1988), S. 19\u201330. Er h\u00e4lt in beiden Arbeiten den Text des pPrisse, den wir hier analysieren, in der Abfolge der Verse f\u00fcr verderbt, er geht von L2 und C aus.

Die Variante \u201cretten\u201d haben wir im \u201cBauer\u201d, Vers 95. Die Variante \u201cwegnehmen, fortnehmen\u201d in Ptahhotep, denn ein Aspekt des Schlafens ist im \u00c4gyptischen das \u201cFortgenommensein\u201d. Ich habe in SAK 1 (1974), S. 186f. gezeigt, da\u00df s\u2202r \u201cschlafen\u201d urspr\u00fcnglich als Zustandsverbum \u201cferngehalten sein, entr\u00fcckt sein\u201d hei\u00dft. Die Schlafenden befinden sich bekanntlich nach \u00e4gyptischer Auffassung im Jenseits, der Unterwelt, bei den Toten.36 So nennt sich Ptahhotep als altersschwacher Mann \u201centr\u00fcckt\u201d, d.h. er schl\u00e4ft infolge der j\u00a2w \u201cKindesschw\u00e4che\u201d auch am Tag gelegentlich ein, so wie das bei kleinen Kindern zu sein pflegt. Dieses Vor-sich-hind\u00e4mmern in Benommenheit, etwa: nach dem Essen, ist gewi\u00df ein Problem des Tags! Im Kontext ist der betreffende Vers Ende einer Teilstrophe. Doch um Unsicherheiten auszur\u00e4umen, ist es wohl richtig, die erste gro\u00dfe Strophe zu drei\u00dfig Versen zu umschreiben. Es ist n\u00e4mlich auch hier m\u00f6glich, ein wenig aus dem Zusammenhang zu schlie\u00dfen, aber nur, wenn dieser Zusammenhang der \u00e4gyptische ist, d.h. als Minimum zun\u00e4chst einmal der metrische.

Es bildet den eindr\u00fccklichen und rhetorisch \u00fcberzeugenden Abschlu\u00df der zweiten Klage. Die Gesamtzahl der Verse ist 95 (5 mal 19). Die beiden gro\u00dfen Themenkreise, die \u201cTeile\u201d, aus denen die Klage besteht, haben jeweils die Gesamtverszahlen 38 (= 2 mal 19) und 57 (= 3 mal 19). Zwischen den m\u00f6glichen Teilungen 35:60 (dies fairerweise gew\u00e4hlt, weil der kleinere Teil hier 38 ist) und 47:48 inclusive liegen dreizehn M\u00f6glichkeiten, davon keine so angenehm einfach passend ist wie unsere 2:3-Aufgliederung. Der erste Teil ist gegliedert: 35 (5 mal 7) und 3 (Unterbrechung durch Rensi, Trennung der beiden Teile), die 35 Verse wiederum in 12\u201311\u201312. Der zweite Teil ist gegliedert in 44 (zweites Thema) und 13 (Schlu\u00dfermahnung), die 44 Verse wieder in 22\u201322, diese beiden 22 in 7\u201315 und 15\u2013 7, diese beiden 15 in 7\u20138 und 8\u20137. Die Schlu\u00dfermahnung f\u00e4llt dagegen mit ihren 7 (3\u20134) und 6 (2\u20134) Versen etwas ab. Andere Redaktoren m\u00f6gen andere L\u00f6sungen gefunden haben. R weicht von B1, soweit erhalten, im Schlu\u00dfteil, aber auch in B1 152 ab. Leider ist von R nicht gen\u00fcgend vorhanden, um die Gliederung zu erfassen. Exkurs Wegen der Bedeutsamkeit, die den Versen mit vier Kola im Redebeginn zukommt, mu\u00df ich hier noch auf den Aufsatz von J. Osing,\u201c Die Worte von Heliopolis\u201d, in: Fontes atque Pontes, FS H. Brunner (Wiesbaden, 1983), S. 347ff. eingehen, der (S. 358, Anm. 29) f\u00e4lschlich meint, zwei Vierheber ansetzen zu m\u00fcssen. Ich gebe meine Umschreibung des Textes, also des Gebetes an Amon-(Re\u2122), sodann Osings und meine \u00dcbersetzung. Selbstverst\u00e4ndlich bauen meine Beitr\u00e4ge auf Osings Leistung in Lesung und \u00dcbersetzung auf.

Die Wortverbindung ist zwar bisher nicht belegt, aber ist doch evident richtig im \u00e4gyptischen Sinne. Der Sonnengott macht die in periodischer Gliederung zu verwirklichende, aktive Zeit (n\u00a2\u00a2) durch seine periodisch unendliche Aktivit\u00e4t\u2014also durch seine Tat\u2014stets wieder jung, wie auch das Jahr rnpt \u201cdas Junge\u201d hei\u00dft, weil jedes neue Jahr als eine gro\u00dfe Zeiteinheit neu und jung herbeigebracht wird. Der Gott kann rnpj-n\u00a2\u00a2 sein, weil er Herr der \u2202tEwigkeit/Zeit ist, des ungegliederten, passiven, potentiellen ZeitVorrats, der also \u201craumhaft\u201d ist, aber nicht Raum. Das Nebeneinander von rnp-n\u00a2\u00a2 und nb-\u2202t ist daher zwar nicht zu \u201cerwarten\u201d, es ist aber sehr sinnvoll. Es mag mit der unbekannten Sonnen-Theologie von Heliopolis verbunden sein. Ich gebe Osings \u00dcbersetzung und damit Gliederung; die Umschrift entspricht, sie er\u00fcbrigt sich. Mit Ausnahme des eben erkl\u00e4rten rnp habe ich ja Osings Umschreibung \u00fcbernommen.

F\u00fcr die Annahme von Vierhebern gibt es keinen Grund. Die Verspaare sind nicht durchg\u00e4ngig, sie sind angenehm aufgelockert durch die Dreiergruppen Vers 9\u201311 (2+1) und Vers 18\u201320 (1+2); dabei sind alle Verse \u201crelative Sinneinheiten\u201d, so wie auch Verspaare, Dreiergruppen, und selten selbst Einzelverse \u201crelative Sinneinheiten\u201d sind. Als Beispiele f\u00fcr solche Einzelverse sind in der Zweiten Klage des \u201cBauern\u201d z.B. die Verse 42 und 78 zu nennen. Es gibt nur eine Bitte: in der ersten 5-Verse-Strophe, in Vers 12/13, und es gibt eine Bitte um Erh\u00f6rung dieser Bitte: in der zweiten 5-VerseStrophe, in Vers 18\u201320, und darauf folgt der Vortrag der \u00dcberzeugung, da\u00df diese Bitte als eine w\u00fcrdige erh\u00f6rt werde. Ich kenne aus der Zeit nach der 1.ZZ. und dem MR einen Vierheber im gro\u00dfen Amarnahymnus (Grab des Aja, M.

Dahinter kann ein Fehler stehen. Der Hymnus ist nur einmal \u00fcberliefert, merkw\u00fcrdig ist die Nennung der Duat. Vielleicht wollte aber auch der k\u00f6nigliche Verfasser seine Kenntnis alter Literatur ins Spiel bringen, ohne freilich die Beschr\u00e4nkung der Vierheber auf den Redebeginn erkannt zu haben. In zwei Zweiheber aufzul\u00f6sen ist der Vers nicht, das zeigt u.a. die Gro\u00dfgliederung, die noch unpubliziert ist.\u2014 Scheinbare Vierheber gibt es in den Leidener Amunshymnen (Zandee, De Hymnen aan Amon van Pap. Leid. 1, 350 [Leiden, 1948]) in gr\u00f6\u00dferer Zahl, wenn man die Verspunkte ernstnimmt, die aber nur bis Z. 11 der zweitletzten Kolumne reichen, was auf Unfertigkeit oder auch Bewu\u00dftsein eigener Unf\u00e4higkeit hinweist, und die nicht alle richtig gesetzt sind, besonders bei den Dreiverse-Gruppen. In den drei von mir metrisch publizierten \u201cKapiteln\u201d (Z\u00c4S 91 [1964], S. 37\u201352) weisen zwei \u201cKapitel\u201d je einen Fehler auf. Nat\u00fcrlich gibt es (selten) Univerbierungen (feste Genetive, einsilbiges Nomen regens), z.B. Km-n-\u00a3t \u201cAugenblick\u201d (Typ \u2122tnt-\u221et, zp-n-jwtj, \u00a2m-n-, k\u00a3-n-, gs-n-jtrw etc.); in IV 21 ist Jmnw-R\u2122w-Pt\u00a2 eine Hebung, die drei werden ja als Eins gesehen. Das einzige wirkliche Problem stellen S\u00e4tze wie II, 5 dar: pt m-nbw nwn m-\u221esbd \u201cder-Himmel ist-Gold, der-Nun ist-Lapislazuli\u201d, die in diesem Text gewertet werden k\u00f6nnen als pt-m-nbw nwn-m-\u221esbd, was die Gliederung \u00fcberzeugend zeigt. Da\u00df hier aber das \u201cgr\u00f6\u00dfte Problem\u201d (Regelliste I 5 in: Fecht, Literarische Zeugnisse, S. 34f.) als St\u00f6rfaktor wirkt, ist leicht zu erkennen. In einer Zeit, als die Metrik erlernt werden musste (von wievielen Schreibern? Wie gut?), weil der Satzakzent sich in Richtung auf das Koptische hin ver\u00e4ndert hatte, d\u00fcrfte z.B. die umgangsprachliche (neu\u00e4gyptische) Vorform des koptischen prwme swtm, also p\u00a3-rm\u2020 \u00a2r/ms\u2202m, als ein einziges Kolon gesprochen worden sein, w\u00e4hrend in der (traditionellen) Metrik noch zwei Kola gemessen wurden, wie die gesamte Masse der metrischen, mehr oder weniger neu\u00e4gyptischen Texte zeigt. Daher ja die Verspunkte, die aber verst\u00e4ndlicherweise l\u00e4ngst nicht alle richtig gesetzt sind. Da\u00df damals die Phrase rmjw \u00a2r-jtrw oder rmjw-\u00a2rjtrw (Regelliste I 5) \u201cdie-Fische(-)im-Flu\u00df\u201d per nefas \u00fcbertragen werden konnte auf das schriftlich damit identische \u201cdie-Fische(-!)sind-imFlu\u00df\u201d/\u201cw\u00e4hrend-die-Fische(-!)im-Flu\u00df-sind\u201d, statt richtiger \u201cdie-Fische sind-im-Flu\u00df\u201d, das liegt nahe. Wie weit der Verfasser der Hymnen (nicht der Punkte-Schreiber) diese Ausweitung getrieben hat, mu\u00df die Einzeluntersuchung bei eindeutiger Gliederung zeigen. (Ich habe dar\u00fcber vor Jahrzehnten mit Kollegen Derchain einen Briefwechsel gef\u00fchrt.)

Ich habe \u00fcber all das geschrieben.

Fischer, Notes on Some Texts of the Old Kingdom and Later\nThe interpretation of the remainder of the inscription raises several questions because of its incompleteness, but the disparate phrases may be translated as follows: 1 2\n3 4 5 6 7\n\u2026 as for any of the \u221enrt-people of the temple \u2026a \u2026 on behalf ofb the hereditary prince, the king\u2019s son, the lector priest, director of those in whom the gods are(?),c the overseer [of priests \u2026 NN]d \u2026 \u2026 It happened that the majesty of this gode came by water \u2026 \u2026 [Year 1,]f third month of summer, day 1, accompanied \u2026 \u2026 I have exempted the priests of this templeg from(?)h \u2026 \u2026 in this temple formerly. I acquired chestsi of \u2026 \u2026 for their sons\u2019 sons, for their childrens\u2019 children \u2026\na\nIn line 5 of the Cairo fragment this term for the temple personnel appears in the masculine form \u221enrw. b The initial \u00a2r-tp cannot belong to a title, for such a title would not take precedence over the exalted titles that follow. c For this title see Junker, Giza XI, p. 84. d The first two titles are identical to those of the \u00cctp-k\u00a3-Mnw of the Cairo fragment; he is given none of the other titles listed here, but was undoubtedly the overseer of the priests of Min, since that document was made in the presence of the inspectors of priests, implying that he was their superior. Quite possibly the same person is involved in both cases. e It seems questionable whether the phrase \u201cmajesty of this god\u201d would have been applied to the king at so early a date as this fragment must be (cf. Goedicke, Die Stellung des Konigs im Alten Reich [Wiesbaden, 1960], p. 41). One of the Eighth Dynasty Coptos decrees mentions the making of a boat of Wsry, \u201cTwo Powerful Ones,\u201d (Urk. I, 298), doubtless referring to the twin gods of the nome, for which see my Coptite Nome, pp. 3, 46; and the passage under consideration may refer to the return of such a vessel from a ceremonial voyage to visit a neighboring divinity. Alternatively, it might concern the visit of a divine bark from a temple located elsewhere (discussed in Fischer, Dendera, pp. 125\u2013 26). \ufb01 f It hardly seems possible that the copy has misread DF. The numeral is omitted in \u201cfirst year,\u201d just as it is on the Cairo fragment. g One would normally expect an exemption of this kind to be executed by the king, but in this case one might expect the subject to be \u00a2m.\u00a1 \u201cmy majesty.\u201d Furthermore the following phrases, in the next line, seem more suited to the boasts of a non-royal person, especially the statement concerning the acquisition of chests of goods, even though these were evidently acquired for the temple. The exemption of the temple priesthood therefore seems to be decreed by the overseer of priests himself. h Reading m-\u2122; but this group could be mk\u00a1 \u201cprotect.\u201d i There is little doubt about the reading of hnw, despite the odd substitution of P for #. The same substitution apparently occurs in the list of offerings on the Cairo stela (col. III, P\u00b5 is evidently to be read mhr \u201cmilk vessel,\u201d which, despite Wb. II, 115, is 6) where \u21223 attested as early as Dynasty 6 (Urk. I, 254, [15]). The reading mr could also be applied to a jar for milk, but it seems doubtful that P was used as a phonetic complement as early as the presumed date of the two Coptite fragments; as Gardiner notes (EG, Sign List, O 5), this use follows its employment as a determinative in a Dynasty 12 occurrence of mrrt \u201cstreet.\u201d\n269\n18 FISCHER Page 270 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:23 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nThe large hieroglyphs at the bottom of the fragment are perplexing. If the pair of strokes beneath is correct, and not a mistake for or , this word must be \u00a1m\u00a3\u221ey \u201crevered,\u201d written in a way that would be unexpected much before the Eleventh Dynasty. The word nb would then belong to the preceding sign rather than to nb \u00a1m\u00a3\u221e \u201cpossesor of reverence.\u201d All of the signs face left, evidently belonging to the same person, the individual for whom the stela was made, who addresses a representation of the local god, or simply faces his temple, located beyond the stela.5 They most surprisingly seem to attribute to this individual a royal epithet, \u201cgiven\u2026 all(?) dominion,\u201d as well as the non-royal epithet \u00a1m\u00a3\u221ey, or nb \u00a1m\u00a3\u221e and this \u201crevered\u201d person is presumably the overseer of priests.6 It is clear that the fragment, along with its counterpart in Cairo, is to be dated beyond the end of the Eighth Dynasty, when the power of the king had waned considerably in the southernmost provinces. Goedicke has assigned the Cairo fragment to that dynasty, but while he rightly compares the basalt false door of Wsr, who has similar titles, he ignores indications that place the false door later, towards the end of the Heracleopolitan Period.7 In the present case this late a date is confirmed not only by the presumptuous combination of epithets that has just been considered, but also the mention of the armlike censer and the sign for \u00a3b; perhaps too the substitution of the sign in place of .8\n\u2039\nm\nZ\nP\n#\n2. Some links between u.e. nomes 7 and 14 Thanks to Torgny S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh\u2019s new publication,9 it is now possible to make a clearer comparison between the Sixth Dynasty tomb chapels of the cemetery hitherto known as Qasr es-Sayyad and those of other sites. The excellent workmanship of the tombs at Meir seem to have been a particular source of inspiration, even though the craftsmen further upstream were somewhat less adroit. Among the motifs that were borrowed, one may note, in the chapel of \u2044dw/Snn\u00a1,10 the female figure, 5 Cf.\nmy Orientation of Hieroglyphs (New York, 1977), pp. 20\u201325. closest parallel that occurs to me, as far as this period is concerned, is the addition, to the names of nomarchs, of such tags as \u201clife, prosperity, health,\u201d \u201cliving for ever and ever,\u201d and \u201cprotection and life about him like Re for ever and ever:\u201d Anthes, Hatnub, passim. The last phrase is also adopted, in the Twelfth Dynasty, by the vainglorious W\u221e\u00a2tp (Blackman, Meir VI, pp. 26, 28 and pl. 13), as well as an even more presumptuous statement (p. 35 and pl. 17). 7 See my Coptite Nome, pp. 40\u201341; Dendera, p. 75, n. 307, p. 89 (13, 14). 8 Another late feature is the addition of a pair of arms to the signs and , which is attested in the Eighth Dynasty Coptos Decrees: ibid., fig. 23 (6) on p. 133. 9 The Old Kingdom Cemetery at Hamra Dom (EL-Qasr wa es-Saiyad) (Stockholm, 1994). 10 Ibid., pl. 8, and Blackman, Meir V, pl. 28. 6 The\n270\n18 FISCHER Page 271 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:23 PM\nHenry G.

A series of attendants carry small shrines of peculiar form, containing jars as well as a standing figure of the owner.12 They are followed by more attendants, carrying portable chests of cloth, and they echo phrases such as \u201cho! cloth that is praised by \u00ca\u00a3wty!\u201d The most elaborate of these phrases rings an interesting change on the parallel at Meir, and one that requires the latter to be reconsidered. The two versions13 are as follows: Q.S.\n\u203a \u00c1\u2039 2\ufb01 TTT u``\u00a1 !xxx~\u00a1\u2039 \u00a2\u2044\u00a7M\u2039@\ufb01\u00a4 \ufb01 ~\u00a1\u00a2 2 \u201eI Meir\n\u203a( I % 2 m \u2039 \u00c1\u2039 \ufb01 x m m \u2122 \u00a4 \u00a3 \u00a1< @ \ufb01 \u00a4\ufb01 TT u``\u00a1! ~\u00a1\u00a2 2 \u201e Blackman translates his version: \u201cAny brightness which the nobles see in the darkness is due to the cloth.\u201d14 This interpretation is precluded by the second version, in which \u201cdarkness\u201d is paralleled by \u201clapis,\u201d presumably because of the darkness of that stone. The correct translation is evidently: \u201cAny brightness that the patricians see is as darkness compared to my cloth,\u201d and: \u201cAny brightness that the patricians see, it is lapis compared to my cloth.\u201d15 As Gardiner notes (EG, p. 129), the basic meaning of the preposition \u221eft is \u201cface to face with,\u201d i.e., vis-\u00e0-vis. A rather similar Old Kingdom example of this preposition, expressing contrast, is:\n$ ^ \ufb01 \u2039@ 'F 2 \u00a1 )` \u2122x\u201e \ufb01 \u02d9\u00a1\u00a2 \u201cI never inflicted evil on a man, despite my power.\u201d16 11 The scene at Meir, like many other motifs in its tomb chapels, occurs in the mastaba of Mereruka at Saqqara, where the wife\u2019s words similarly conclude with an \u201coath of asseveration:\u201d discussed in Z\u00c4S 105 (1978), pp. 44\u201347; 107 (1980), p. 86. 12 S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh, op. cit., pl. 15; Meir V, pls. 19, 26.

An ostracon from Helwan The ostracon shown in fig. 2 is one of a pair published by Hans Goedicke under the title \u201cTwo Lost Old Kingdom Ostraca,\u201d17 on the basis of photographs found among the papers of Bernard Grdseloff in 1958, or somewhat earlier. They were not in fact lost, but are in the Cairo Museum, where they bear the Journal d\u2019Entr\u00e9e numbers 88555 (shown here) and 87192. I made copies of both of them in 1956, along with those I have discussed in Orientalia 29 (1960), pp. 187\u201390, and Goedicke discussed this one with me at the museum when he came upon me at work. On that occasion he thought that the place named in the heading should be read Nst-\u00ccr \u201cThrone of Horus.\u201d I think he is right in abandoning this \ufb01 idea, but cannot agree with his present transcription: < . The third , and not , while the first one is . His attempt to sign is indeed see the presumed gst as a variant spelling of g\u00a2st \u201cgazelle\u201d is therefore to no purpose. In view of the fact that the final can hardly be \u201cHorus,\u201d which ,18 the only interpretation would be written ,or more probably of \u00d4r-st-\u00a2r that occurs to me is \u201cunder (my?) supervision.\u201d Although \ufb02r-st-\u00a2r is not known to have replaced \ufb02r-\u00a2r in this sense prior to the Middle Kingdom (Wb. III, 316 [6]), some similar st-compounds were in use earlier (Edel, Alt\u00e4g. Gramm., \u00a7 260), and so the present example would not be anomalous. For other toponyms introduced by \ufb02r one may compare and .19 Goedicke\u2019s reading of the feminine name is likewise untenable, for the first sign is not but . P\ufb02r.s is not attested from other sources, but a feminine name P\ufb02r-nfrt is known from Dynasty 6,20 while P\ufb02rt (Ranke, PN I, 136.4 ) is attested for the Middle Kingdom, and from the Old Kingdom we have its masculine counterpart P\ufb02r (ibid., 420.14). The name P\ufb02r.s evidently identifies the mother of the deceased, who is mentioned thereafter. His rather unusual name, \u00ccbs, is likewise unknown elsewhere.21 Both these names, like many others,22 may refer to the circumstances of birth; the first would then mean \u201cshe turns about\u201d (par-\n\u00d8\n@\n<\n\u00d8 \u00a33\n@\u00ef\n\u221e\u221a\n\u00d8\nY\n@p O j\n0\n6 cm\n17\nFestschrift zum 100-j\u00e4hrigen Bestehen der Papyrussammlung der \u00d6sterreichischen Nationalbibliothek Papyrus Erzherzog Rainer (Vienna, 1983), pp. 155\u2013164. 18 Among the many names of estates mentioning Horus that are listed by Helen Jacquet-Gordon, Domaines, p. 480, only three have the phonetic writing: pp. 189, 383, 392. The phonetic writing is usual in non-royal personal names, but is scarcely ever reduced to \u00d8; for one such exception see Ranke, PN II, 296(1). 19 Karola Zibelius, \u00c4gyptische Siedlungen nach Texten des Alten Reiches (Wiesbaden, 1978), pp. 192\u2013194. 20 Incorrectly listed as P\ufb02rt-nfrt by Ranke, PN II, 136(5); this misreading is explained in my Egyptian Studies III: Varia Nova (New York, 1996), p. 66, n. 173.\n272\nFig. 2.

Although I feel doubtful about the precise form of the final determinative, Goedicke is probably right in concluding that the orientation of the outstretched human figure is reversed.23 This reversal is quite unexpected, for the recumbent figure of a corpse is normally shown with the head forward.24 It should also be noted that a stream of blood appears to emerge from the head\u2014a detail that is known from one of the Helwan ostraca published formerly.25 It does not seem necessary to comment on Goedicke\u2019s lengthy discussion of the \u201cEast Nome,\u201d which is mentioned as the region in which \u00d4r-st-\u00a2r was located, except to express disagreement with his conclusion that it likewise designates the province in which Helwan was situated. 4. The reading of the Old Kingdom sign for \u201cweaver\u201d I have already acknowledged in Egyptian Studies III: Varia Nova (New York, 1996), p. 239, that the Old Kingdom sign representing a female weaver cannot be read \u00a1n\u2122t, as I had previously deduced, since \u00a1n\u2122t is a distinctively different title. That does not mean, however, that one should revert to the reading \u00a1rjt, proposed earlier by Junker,26 for there is further evidence that strongly favors another solution. That evidence is provided by the meticulous drawings in Christiane Ziegler\u2019s Le Mastaba d\u2019Akhethetep (Paris, 1993), p. 176, where the object held in the lap of the seated woman is delineated in greater detail than in any other example known to me (fig. 3).27 The object cannot be a shuttle, as I have suggested elsewhere,28 nor can it be a spindle ( : Gardiner\u2019s W34), as Ziegler proposes,29 or any other implement used in\nj\n21\nBut cf. \u00ccbsy, Ranke, PN II, 305(2), from a papyrus of the Second Intermediate Period: Smither, JEA 34 (1948), p. 32 and pl. 7A, lines 4 and 11. There is some uncertainty about the termination of this name. 22 Ranke, PN II, pp. 3, 30, 198. 23 I had myself thought that it might show the body on a bier, with a cloth ( ) thrown over \u00a2 the foot-board, as in Dows Dunham and W.K.

The one in the chapel of Mr(w)-\u00a1b(\u00a1) (LD II, 20a) is insufficiently intact, as I have seen from a photograph kindly provided by Peter Der Manuelian. 28 Egyptian Women of the Old Kingdom (New York, 1989), pp. 10\u201311.\n273\n18 FISCHER Page 274 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:23 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nweaving.30 It is clearly the \u00a2ts-scepter, good examples of which are to be found in the tombs of two queens of the Fourth Dynasty at Giza: Mr-sy-\u2122n\u221e (fig. 4)31 and R\u221et-R\u2122 (fig. 5).32 Since it seems unlikely that the scepter as such would be be placed in the lap of the weaver, it evidently functions as a phonetic element, forming a composite hieroglyph of a kind that is well attested in the Old Kingdom.33 And it is closely paralleled by a composite of this kind signifying \u00a2mt \u201cservant\u201d (fig. 6).34 The meaning of \u00a2ts, as applied to female weavers, is rather obscure. Apart from its reference to a scepter,35 it occurs in the epithet wrt \u00a2ts, with or without the addition of nbty \u201cthe Two Ladies,\u201d referring to the king, and is somtimes accompanied by wrt \u00a2zwt \u201cgreat of praises,\u201d which may convey much the same sense.36 This suggests that the weaver called \u00a2tst may have been \u201cone who is rewarded\u201d or \u201cadorned,\u201d and she is, in fact, repeatedly shown receiving costly ornaments in payment for her services.37 In other contexts \u00a2ts also refers to \u201ccompleting\u201d a period of time, and to \u201ccelebrating\u201d a festival.38 I feel doubtful that this meaning can be stretched to refer to weavers who were \u201cfinished\u201d in learning their craft, or who \u201cfinished\u201d the process of weaving, as distinguished from those who assisted in preparing the rove, spinning the thread, setting up the warp, and so on. But, at all events, the designation \u00a2tst seems to honor them as particularly skilled and well-paid workers.\nFig. 4. \u00ccts-sign, tomb of Queen Mr-sy-\u2122n\u221e.\nb\n29\nOp. cit., p. 130.

Freed\nF\new have made contributions to as many areas of Egyptology as William Kelly Simpson. He is especially renowned for his advancement of Middle Kingdom studies, and his pioneering volume, The Terrace of the Great God at Abydos,1 published in 1974, has led many to look at Middle Kingdom stelae in new and useful ways.2 This study,3 offered in his honor and inspired by his research, represents, in part, an attempt to address one of the questions posed by him in that volume, namely whether it is possible to identify the work of individual sculptors or workshops of relief sculptors.4 In a broader sense, it examines stelae for the information they can provide about the organization of artisans in early Dynasty 12 and the development of relief styles.5 Accordingly, works are grouped together on the basis of their similar style or iconography. Stelae with significant elements in common are considered to come from the same \u201cworkshop\u201d or \u201cstudio,\u201d here defined as a group of artisans working cooperatively in the same place over a period of time and observing a common model.6 Although written records are lacking, that such workshops existed seems only logical, particularly in the Middle Kingdom, when large 1 William\nKelly Simpson, The Terrace of the Great God at Abydos: The Offering Chapels of Dynasties 12 and 13 (New Haven and Philadelphia, 1974). 2 For a review of literature on stelae since Simpson\u2019s work, see C.

Freed, The Development of Middle Kingdom Egyptian Relief: Sculptural Schools of Late Dynasty XI, with an Appendix on the Trends of Early Dynasty XII (Ph.D. Dissertation, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, 1984), p. 207ff., and for the Second Intermediate Period by M.

This study covers a representative sample of workshops from approximately the beginning of Dynasty 12 through the reign of Amenemhat II. Although stelae from that time have been found throughout the Nile Valley,7 workshops may be identified with certainty only at Abydos, Thebes, and Elephantine, owing to the number of stelae found at those sites. The Theban and Abydene workshops are discussed here.8 While the primary focus of the study is art historical, inscriptional information, particularly in the offering formula, is included when it provides information about the date of a stela or workshop. It is hoped that further work will add more stelae to the workshops listed on the following pages, uncover additional workshops, and refine those workshops identified here. Clarification of terminology A stela workshop is defined here as three or more stelae sharing distinctive aspects of composition or style which collectively set them apart from others. Each workshop is given a name based on one or more of its salient characteristics although stelae in a given workshop may show considerable variety aside from their shared attributes. In virtually no case are all of the distinctive attributes found on all the stelae. Alternatively, stelae associated with certain workshops appear so similar as to suggest the work of an individual artist. The \u201cVertical Curls and Flower Group\u201d is an example. Stelae in the same workshop may span several decades. Occasionally, architectural elements such as wall reliefs and false doors are included in the workshops where they meet the appropriate criteria. Most of the monuments discussed are decorated in relief, but a few uncarved stelae which were painted (usually, although not necessarily, in preparation for carving) are included, based on their similarity to carved examples in a given workshop. For each member of a workshop, an attempt is made to include at least one primary or significant reference where additional information about the piece may be found. Photographs of representative examples of each group are also included.\n7 Stelae\nwere also found at quarry sites beyond the Nile Valley. For the Elephantine workshops, see Franke, Heqaib, p. 109ff. For a reference to a stela found near Elephantine which I believe was made in Abydos, see \u201cPacked Offerings Group.\u201d\n8\n298\n20 FREED Page 299 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:25 PM\nRita E. Freed, Stela Workshops of Early Dynasty 12\nGenerally, the provenance given is the one listed in the primary publication of the stela. All those in Simpson\u2019s groupings in Terrace of the Great God at Abydos are assumed to come from Abydos. He includes examples from the great mid-nineteenth century collections of Athanasi and Anastasi, sold at auction in London in 1837 and 1857 respectively. Following Simpson\u2019s model, other stelae from those collections not included in his groupings are also treated as Abydene.9 As far as date is concerned, a stela is considered dated if it contains a cartouche in or near its lunette or upper border, or if the context of the cartouche otherwise implies that the stela\u2019s owner lived during the reign of the king mentioned.10 A stela is labeled \u201cdatable\u201d (as opposed to \u201cdated\u201d) if it belongs to the same owner as a dated stela or if its owner is known through other sources, such as statuary or papyri, to be associated with a given king. Stelae listed together by Simpson in the same group (see below) are considered to be approximately contemporary when a product of the same workshop. Workshops are listed in approximate chronological order, although there is substantial overlapping.

Possibly as early as late Dynasty 11, although most are more likely to be early in the reign of Amenemhat I. This is based on a combination of style,11 inscription,12 and the archaeological record.13 Relief Style. Stelae in this group may be carved in either relatively low, flat, raised relief, sunk relief with a deep outline, or painted only. Regardless of the technique, they all preserve abundant and skillfully painted detailing, particularly in the offerings. Males tend to be either short and stocky or overly thin-waisted, and females may be quite slender and high-waisted. Shared Attributes. This group, which may be either horizontal or vertical in format, is characterized by a large, figural field and an inscription most often restricted to no more than two lines. Often the inscription does not include an offering formula but only identifies the figures depicted and names one of a variety of deities. Women and men share equal prominence. Relatively large facial features are given extra emphasis through paint. Eyes and brows are placed particularly high on the face and extend in thick, parallel cosmetic lines to the temples. Men often sport short beards and carry staves with upturned ends.14 The offerings represented are disproportionately large and few in number. They tend 11 For the low flat, raised relief style of MMA 16.10.333 and Cairo, JE 45626, which is char-\nacteristic of Amenemhat I see R.

There is at times an inventiveness seen, for example, in Cairo, JE 45626, where three figures on a chair with two backs interlock arms (and legs) in an embrace. Comments. Although generally not quite as fine, the style of painting and relief is remarkably similar to what is found in the tombs of Dagy and Meketre at Thebes, which have recently been redated to Mentuhotep III and the early years of Amenemhat I respectively.15 This represents a continuation of a style seen on a group of Theban stelae made during the reign of Mentuhotep II after the reunification.16 The beginning of a dynasty, before its canons are established, is at times characterized by the charm and playful inventiveness seen in this group. Vienna \u00c4S 202 preserves traces of a full eighteen-square grid, perhaps the earliest stela to do so.17 This fleshing out of the limited guidelines of the Old Kingdom Achsenkreuz came about presumably as an attempt to emulate Old Kingdom proportions at a time when Old Kingdom monuments were again accessible.18 The fact that it is often impossible to distinguish between late Dynasty 11 and early Dynasty 12 material at Thebes lends further support to Arnold\u2019s theory that Amenemhat I ruled from Thebes for a longer period than is generally realized.19 Both the inscriptions and decoration of MMA 16.10.327, MMA 16.10.333, Cairo, JE 45626, and Cairo JE 45625 may have been executed by the same hand.

Based on the high, rounded relief style of some and the jewel-like, incised detailing of others (see comments), it is possible that a few stelae in this group are attributable to late Dynasty 11. According to Hodjash and Berlev, the fact that the name of the owner of Moscow 4159 is separated from his titles by the epithet \u00a1m\u00a3\u221e \u221er and the name of the patron deity supports a date prior to Dynasty 12.20 The phrase n.f after prt.\u221erw on Ashmolean A 149 is commonly found on Heracleopolitan Period false doors and post-reunification Dynasty 11 monuments from Thebes.21 On the basis of style and attributes, however, most stelae in this workshop appear to be early Dynasty 12. Dated examples of the bookroll with single tie, seen on Leiden V 125, are not known earlier than the coregency between Amenemhat I and Sesostris I.22 Relief Style. These stelae display considerable variation of style. The relief may be decidedly high and rounded or significantly lower and flatter. One stela is carved in sunk relief. Musculature in legs and knees are often exaggerated. Incised interior detailing is generally restricted to wigs on both men and women. Figures tend to be canonical vertically but males particularly may vary from canonical norm in breadth of shoulders or girth. Shared Attributes. The presence of a large-scale standing couple, a triad of equal height, and less often, a single male bind these stelae together as a group. With the previous Theban-based workshop it shares, in most instances, a limited area for inscriptions. When present, offerings tend to be relatively packed and restricted to the far side of the stela by a visual barrier created by a walking stick. Additional shared attributes include a large basin with tapering sides which either rests on the offering table or replaces it, and a scepter with upturned end (also seen on the previous group) held by many males. On a few stelae, the offering table itself is quite tiny, and either the walking stick or a flower stem may rest directly on it. In several instances the walking stick\n20 Hodjash and Berlev note that this separation is unattested after Dynasty 11, Egyptian Reliefs, no. 27. 21 E.

A triangle is either incised or cut out of the bottom of the table leg. On many, incised detailing draws attention to the wigs. Individual curls on male wigs generally are arranged in horizontal rows or radiate out from a central point on the skull and follow the contour of the head. Female wigs may also be decorated. Either the hair is \u201cbraided,\u201d as indicated by cross-hatched lines, or it is pulled directly back from the forehead, as indicated by incised parallel lines. Comments. The geographical spread of this stela group (Thebes to Abydos) suggests the increasing popularity of stelae, as well as the greater ease of travel and communication in the post-reunification years. The relief style and attributes of Los Angeles County Museum 50.37.13 are very similar to those of Ashmolean A 149, which was also found at Dendera. These two stelae may well be the earliest known from the workshop or be from the hand of an artist trained prior to the reunification. This is based on the non-canonical style of the Ashmolean stela and the intricate interior detailing seen on both. The latter is found not only at Dendera,23 but also in the tombs of Mentuhotep II\u2019s minor queens at Thebes, which predate the reunification,24 and in other contemporary material.25 The bold, rounded, raised relief style of Moscow 4159 is also very similar to what is found on Theban material dating prior to the reunification.26 Conversely, the low, flat, raised relief style devoid of interior detailing and the overall formality of MFA 25.659 from Naga ed Deir reflects the Northern influence on early Dynasty 12 material. Although differences of style link certain stelae to specific sites, overall there is a tendency toward standardization of format and sophistication. Such features link these stelae more closely to later Twelfth Dynasty works. Within the standardization, there is still room for creativity, as seen, for example, in Berlin 22820, where the owner K\u00a3\u00a1 carries a bow and arrows in the same manner as he would carry a walking stick and scepter. He is also accompanied by his hunting dogs. The curved stick held horizontally on several stelae in this group and the flower held at the base of the stem on Marseilles 21 are features found on other stelae from the end of Dynasty 11 and early Dynasty 12.27 23\nW.

Simpson attributes Leiden V 124 to the same sculptor as Leiden V, 125 (Terrace, p. 4, n. 25), but I prefer to see them as the work of two different hands in the same workshop. The somewhat better quality of Leiden V 125 suggests that it served as the model from which Leiden V 124 was made. Both belong to the same owner. 29 When the capital moved to \u2044\u2020-t\u00a3wy during the reign of Amenemhat I, it is likely that the center of stela production also shifted northward. 28\n307\n20 FREED Page 308 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:25 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nFig. 3a.

With one exception all the stelae in this group were carved in sunk relief or combine raised and sunk relief. Both types are unmodeled and share rather coarsely incised linear interior detailing. Proportions are often non-canonical. In the case of Berlin \u00c4GM 26/66, two figures display the elongated legs, high waists, and small heads characteristic of pre-reunification Dynasty 11.30 In other examples, torsos are elongated or heads too large or too small. Shared Attributes. Prominent pug noses and fleshy upper and lower lips forming a horizontal \u201cV\u201d in the cheek are the most notable features of this group. A pronounced hydrocephalic bulge and too thin necks are often evident on males represented either in close-fitting wigs or natural hair. The attribute they most frequently carry is a folded bolt clutched to the chests. On women\u2019s sheath dresses, a relief-carved band generally delineates the upper border. In most instances, the offerings are loosely organized, but the pairing of similar items indicates an interest in symmetry. For example, on Berlin \u00c4GM 26/66 and Louvre C 3, two geese lie hind-quarter-to-hind-quarter on an offering table, and their heads hang limply but decoratively over the sides. On another (CG 20756) paired leeks are shown in a similar manner, and in yet another (Munich \u00c4S 33) joined double breads ( ) are shown in pairs. This type of bread31 appears on all but one stela in this group. Other shared attributes not commonly found on stelae include a duck head among the offerings, ducks in flight(?) restrained by a leash, and jars of sacred oils, which are named.32 Many of the tables are noteworthy for their truncated conical tops with concave sides placed atop narrow legs. Two stelae occasionally write horizontally oriented signs vertically,33 perhaps as a space-saving measure. Others have additional inscriptional oddities including confused signs, reverse orientation, and the sporadic use of hieratic. Comments. Many of these stelae belong to the same family group (ANOC), as shown by Simpson, but additionally, the figural areas of Louvre C 3, C 19, and Munich \u00c4S 33 are clearly by the same artisan,34 who also carved the inscription. This is one of the earliest of the Abydene schools and differs from the approximately contemporary (or 30 W.\nBarta, Selbstzeugnis, pp. 75\u201376. a discussion of these breads see Vernus, RdE 25 (1973), p. 230. 32 For comments on the oils, ibid., p. 230. 33 On Louvre C 1 several n\u2019s ( ) and one r ( ) are oriented vertically and there is one vertical n on CG 20756. This occurs occasionally on stelae outside this workshop as well. 34 The presence of the same hand on Munich \u00c4S 33 and Louvre C 3 was already noted by Simpson in Vernus, RdE 25 (1973), p. 230. 31 For\n\u00a4\n3\n309\n20 FREED Page 310 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:25 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nslightly earlier) \u201cColorful Theban Group\u201d in its lengthier inscriptions and, not surprisingly given its Abydene provenance, in both the mention of Osiris and the inclusion of his multiple epithets.

The presence of the cartouches of Amenemhat I and Sesostris I on CG 20516 therefore dates the group. Relief Style. All were carved in sunk relief. Incised detailing is mainly restricted to male wigs and flowers. Males are canonically correct, or nearly so. Women\u2019s torsos and arms are often attenuated. Shared Attributes. Men wearing close-fitting wigs meticulously incised with rigid vertical rows of individual curls, and women carrying straight-sided lotus flowers with short stems are among the many unifying characteristics of this group. Almond-shaped eyes without incised cosmetic lines or eyebrows, pointed noses, small straight mouths, and relatively large ears with distinct inner ridges are also shared. Of the three member stelae of this group which have offering tables (CG 20516, CG 20256 and Hearst 93), the overall design is very similar. Each table, for example, exhibits the unusual feature of a leg with its extra ring at the bottom and top. The latter two stelae also share a meat offering of roughly heart shape with a projection at the top, a shape seldom found on stelae.\n310\n20 FREED Page 311 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:25 PM\nRita E.

In relief style, attributes, and epigraphy these stelae are strikingly similar, and it is not out of the question that they were all made by the same artist. Many of the stelae exhibit a slight awkwardness in execution, particularly in the proportions of female figures. Various body parts are either too long, too thin, or too fleshy, as if the sculptor was unfamiliar with any canon of proportion. This awkwardness can also be seen in the off-center table leg and mat on Hearst 93, a feature that undoubtedly contributed to the initial belief that the piece was spurious.35 The offerings radiating out from a central point on the table of CG 20256 is also unusual. Further, the arrangement of hieroglyphs on many of the stelae in this workshop is uneven. All of these things suggest they were made during a period of experimentation, as one might expect at the beginning of Dynasty 12 at a site like Abydos, which had previously lacked a strong tradition of stela production. For Late Eleventh and Early Dynasty 12 parallels to the curved stick on Hearst 93, see note 14 above. WORKSHOP NO. 5.

All were carved in low, flat raised relief. Interior modeling was used sparingly and skillfully, especially to highlight leg muscles and facial features. Interior detailing is restricted to jewelry and the essential elements of offerings. Figures are canonically correct. Shared Attributes. On all members of this group, the offerings are artificially compressed, forming a compact, rigidly rectilinear unit. Also, the offerings are balanced on reed leaves with overly tall stems arranged on distinctive, split-foot splayed-leg tables. The tables additionally feature an extra ring between the leg and the table top. At least one spoutless \u00a2s vase and a libation set lies below the table. The strict academic symmetry apparent in JE 36420 may also have been present in CG 20315, which is damaged. Comments. The low, flat relief style and rigidly symmetrical composition which characterizes all the stelae in this group support a date in the reign of Amenemhat I.37 At this time artisans had not yet achieved the sophistication of stelae carving or subtlety of detail which appears later in the reign of Sesostris I (see workshops following). Cairo JE 36420 was found in Aswan, but because it bears such a striking resemblance to other stelae in this group, one of which comes from Abydos, it seems likely the Aswan stela was also made in Abydos.38 WORKSHOP NO. 6.

Late Amenemhat I to Sesostris I. Undated stelae are dated on the basis of family relationship to dated examples or on the basis of relief style. Offering formulae incorporate the classic hallmarks of the first half of Dynasty 12.39 Relief Style. These stelae exhibit mainly raised relief, the height of which varies from low and flat to a higher, more rounded surface. Modeling is particularly noticeable on the face, torso and legs. Incised interior detailing is sparingly and artfully used, particularly on wigs and offerings. All figures are canonical. Shared Attributes. The dominant presence of a male figure, usually alone and standing, unites most of these stelae. On many, naturalistically rendered rolls of fat and a sagging breast symbolize prosperity. Offerings are organized into a discreet area. Although they fill the available space, they are only loosely balanced, rather than being artificially compressed, as they are in the \u201cPacked Offerings Group\u201d above. A conspicuously large eye may be further highlighted by delicately incised lines or shallow depressions rendered above, below, and sometimes encircling the orbit. Comments. The hands of master artisans are evident on a number of these stelae. For example, subtle modeling sets off the abdomen and back muscles of the owner of Leiden V 2, and the neck muscle of the deceased in Louvre C 34. Often the contrast between shallow and more deeply carved incised detailing creates an almost three-dimensional ef39 Bennett, JEA 27 (1941), pp. 77\u201382. G.

Nowhere is it more beautifully done than on the feathered wings and webbed feet of the duck on BM 585. There is also a sense of playfulness in the way the duck\u2019s tail on BM 558 overlaps the side border and in the manner that the foot of a figure on Louvre C 34 steps into the inscription. CG 20473 and CG 20474 are wall reliefs. The many stylistic similarities between them and Louvre C 2 indicate that they were carved by the same hand.40 On BM 558 and BM 587 the similar faces and naturalistically rendered hair (including the hint of sideburns), also suggest they were executed by the same artist. Overall, the provincial, folk art quality of many earlier stelae is absent in this group, but there is still a playfulness seen in the experimentation with surface textures and the violation of borders. All of these stelae appear to have come from Abydos and were most likely made there by an experienced, well established school. WORKSHOP NO. 7.

First half of the reign of Sesostris I on the basis of the dated and datable stelae in the group and the stylistic similarity of the undated stelae to the dated examples. Relief Style. The stelae in this group exhibit a wide variety of relief styles. Seven out of the thirteen were executed in a low, flat, raised relief. Two combine this type of raised relief with a \u201csilhouette\u201d sunk relief for the minor figures, where not just the outline but the entire figure is depressed considerably below the surface of the background. Two are carved entirely in this sunk relief technique, and one is painted only. Except for the leg muscles, there is virtually no modeling, but incised details, including those articulating anatomical elements, may be abundant. The proportions of all the main figures approximate canonical norm, but there is great variety within the minor figures. Shared Attributes. A false door incised on the bottom register of five stelae (CG 20470, CG 20515, CG 20088, Hearst 5-352, and Berlin 1192) is the element for which this workshop is named. Two eyes adorn the door\u2019s lintel. Additional attributes shared by other stelae in the group include the enumeration of offerings in the lunette, the arrangement of offerings (especially \u00a2s jars and libation basins) beneath the offering table, and the placement of a mirror or b\u00a3s jar beneath the legs of a seated female. Reed leaves on offering tables have almost imperceptible stems. In general, offerings are relatively few and loosely grouped. On or near the top of the offering pile, an over-large lettuce, when present, tends to dwarf other items. With two exceptions, all stelae feature at least one seated couple (a man and usually his wife, but occasionally his mother or sister). On many raised relief examples, shared details include horizontal registers of curls on male wigs and parallel strands on the wigs of women.

In addition to the main couple, most of these stelae have one or more registers of auxiliary figures, usually identified as family members. In most instances, they stand with both hands hanging empty at their sides or with one raised in a worshipful gesture. On only a few stelae are auxiliary figures depicted in more active poses or bearing offerings. Comments. The variety of proportions approximating canonical norm seen on some of these stelae is to be expected in the early years of Dynasty 12 because the bulk of canonical material of the North would have been accessible to court artisans for relatively few years. Low, very flat relief is also characteristic of this time. The custom of clasping a lotus at or near the bottom of its stem (Leiden V 85 and Louvre C 32) is a hold-over from the previous dynasty41 and is seldom found in Dynasty 12. The facial features of the raised relief stelae are relatively similar to what is seen on stelae dated to Sesostris I\u2019s second decade in the long-enduring \u201cMany Active Figures group\u201d (see below). Eyes appear on lintels of false doors in the tomb chapels beginning in the late Old Kingdom.42 Berlin 1192, CG 20263, and CG 20751 appear to be by the same hand. Similarly one artisan likely produced, Louvre C 32 and CG 20515, as well as possibly CG 20470. Another hand was responsible for both Leiden V 85 and CG 20524. WORKSHOP NO. 8.

Based on the numerous dated examples, and the stylistic similarity of the undated pieces to the dated ones, this workshop must belong in the four last decades of the reign of Sesostris I. Relief Style. All member stelae are in relatively high raised relief, which often includes interior modeling, especially in the area of the leg muscles. Incised interior detailing, particularly emphasizing details of offerings and attire, is abundant in some, but in others it is more restrained. All figures are canonical. Shared Attributes. Attendants carrying an interesting variety of goods, as well as the presence of numerous, well-organized offerings on tables characterize this group. The existence of separate baselines for single figures on CG 20561 and MMA 12.184 and small tables for just a few offerings provide further examples of the organizational tendencies artisans of the group exhibit. The leg of the main table has two variants; it is either slightly concave and narrower at the top with separate rings at top and bottom, or broadly splayed and split at the foot. The static appearance produced at first glance by the neat spacing of offering bearers with their repetitive gestures (particularly on Louvre C 167, C 168, and Alnwick 1932), is offset, however, by the rich variety of offerings, many of which feature realistic details executed with\n321\n20 FREED Page 322 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:25 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nFig. 8a.

The net bags in which women carry jars on CG 20561 and Louvre C 167 and the tapered vertical rows of curls on Leiden V 3, V 4 and Turin 1534 provide delightful examples. Facial features in this group tend to be relatively uniform. Eyes are large and almond-shaped. Brows and cosmetic lines are often executed in paint only, and ears are large and well defined. Especially on the minor figures, the elongated and at times aquiline nose above a tiny upturned mouth produces a profile with a slightly compressed appearance. Comments. The dated stelae in the group demonstrate the tendency for relief to become higher and more plastically modeled as the reign progresses. Stela format has now become relatively standardized, and although the overall organization is similar in earlier groups (for example compare CG 20561 to MMA 65.269 in the \u201cFew Standing Figures Group,\u201d or MMA 12.184 to BM 152 in the \u201cPacked Offerings Group\u201d), there is often now a polished sophistication which sets them apart from the somewhat provincial awkwardness and forced organization of earlier examples. Both the overall design and the exquisitely carved details of these stelae bear eloquent testimony to the skill of their artisans, who, one might conjecture, were now part of a thriving community of artisans at Abydos. It is likely that CG 20561, Louvre C 167,43 Louvre C 168, MMA 12.184 and Alnwick 1932 were carved by the same artist. Similarly, Turin 1534, Leiden V 3 and Leiden V 4 may be a product of the same hand. WORKSHOP NO. 9.

An elegant attenuation marks many figures, particularly the attendants, but it seems clear this was done deliberately rather than in an unsuccessful attempt to produce canonically correct figures. This elongation is echoed in the exaggerated thinness of many of the offerings and even in the long, narrow shape of many of the stelae themselves. Lyrically curved lines offset the vertical emphasis. This is seen, for example, in the pronounced curve at the back of the skull of males in cap wigs (the feature after which the group was named), the upturned legs of tables, and the curvilinear shape of many of the vessels. Incised interior detailing is sparse and, for the most part, restricted to offerings. Modeling is used with great skill, particularly to highlight musculature in the arms, legs, abdomen, and even the neck, which is marked by a vertical depression on five stelae in this group. Shared Attributes. In addition to the pronounced bulge at the back of the head and the deeply split table leg with upturned ends mentioned above, many of these stelae display offerings piled loosely around tables with no pretense of balance, and a wide variety of jar shapes. Generally the number of offerings is quite limited. Male owners are often overweight, and this is represented by abstract horizontal cuts on the chest and a pendant breast. (On only the false door fragment, MFA 1980.173, is this rendered with any degree of naturalism.) Most seated men wear a wrap-around kilt exposing part of the thigh. On women\u2019s dresses, a lock of hair substitutes for at least one shoulder strap. The nose is the most prominent facial feature and is either long and decidedly aquiline or comes to a point. Comments. The large size of this group reflects, at least in part, the increasing demand for stelae at Abydos toward the end of Sesostris I\u2019s reign. Because of the demand, there is also a tendency toward mass production, and that may account for the wholesale substitution of sunk relief for the more time-consuming raised relief, as well as the absence of meticulously carved detail. Instead, the skill of the artisans is expressed in their use of abstract curvilinear forms, which have their own decorative impact. Simpson noted that BM 572, BM 562, and BM 581 were carved by the same hand.45 To this list should be added Vienna 90, Kansas City 33\u201316, CG 20425, CG 20539, CG 20458, and CG 20456 Recto at least as far as the decorative areas are concerned.

Freed, Stela Workshops of Early Dynasty 12\nDyn.\u201d (see Workshop no. 10, notes i\u2013o, w, ac\u2013ad, and ak), on the basis of other sources of information about the people represented. The presence of the title nbt-pr (Woman of the House) on two of the stelae (Berlin 1188 and Guimet 11324), has often been used as an argument for a date of Amenemhat III or later. However, noting the relatively frequent occurrence of the title in the context of dated tombs from the reign of Mentuhotep II on, Obsomer argues for a pre-Amenemhat III date for their appearance on stelae.47 Additionally, many of these stelae preface the name of the owner with n \u00a1m\u00a3\u221e, rather than n k\u00a3 n \u00a1m\u00a3\u221e, which, as noted earlier, is rare after Amenemhat II.48 As far as a terminus post quem for this workshop, many of these stelae indicate filiation by \u00a1r(t).n rather than ms(t).n. According to Obsomer, this places them at the end of the reign of Sesostris I at the earliest, or the reign of Amenemhat II.49 In short, art historical, philological and administrative criteria all point to a date from Late Sesostris I through Amenemhat II for this workshop. Relief Style. The stelae in this group share a strikingly similar carving style. For the most part, they are in sunk relief with an occasional element in raised relief to provide contrast. This is seen, for example, on CG 20566 with the owner and his wife, the main offering table on CG 20091 and CG 20094, and a pile of offerings on Oriental Institute 9920 and BM 576. There is an angularity evident in the carving, produced by outlining figures and objects with a deep, sharp line, and making a second cut from the interior, which meets the first at approximately a 45\u00b0 angle. No attempt was made however, to smooth the sharp edge left where the second cut meets the interior surface, as was done in the \u201cElongated Skull Group.\u201d The angularity is carried over into the shape of the figures, particularly those of the male attendants whose torsos are reduced to a triangle from which thin straight arms hang limply downward. Often the arms, not only of the minor figures, but of the owner and his wife as well, are overly long, and in that sense they are non-canonical. The offering table, the offerings, and even the hieroglyphs (Mus\u00e9e Guimet 10) may assume the same attenuated form. Incised interior detailing and modeling is virtually non-existent on both main and minor figures, although the essential elements of offerings are occasionally indicated, perhaps to identify them. 47\nObsomer, \u201cCrit\u00e8res de datation,\u201dpp. 166\u201367, where all the previous discussions are summarized. 48 See note 44. 49 Ibid., pp. 180\u201391.\n331\n20 FREED Page 332 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:25 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nDespite the overall angularity, a number of stelae make use of curves in an ingenious way. On CG 20531, CG 20546 and BM 162, the top few lines of hieroglyphs curve to echo the rounded tops of the stelae themselves. Even and generally fairly ample spacing of the figures, whether carrying offerings or empty-handed, as well as the tendency toward similar gestures, give these stelae an overall repetitive and somewhat sterile feeling. They are easily recognizable as a group. Shared Attributes. The majority of stelae in this large group fit into a few basic models. Most commonly the owner, always male, sits while his wife stands some distance behind and clasps him on his far shoulder. A column of inscription between them identifies her. Less commonly he sits alone. On a few stelae only standing figures are shown. The last group is generally devoid of both offerings and an offering formula.50 Additionally, most stelae feature six or more family members who stand on subsidiary registers with their arms hanging limp and emptyhanded at their sides. Most are identified by their relationship to the stela owner. Occasionally, attendants bring one or two items of food or drink, and this contrasts sharply with the more heavily laden offering bearers seen on stelae from other workshops, for example, in the \u201cIncised False Door Group.\u201d Seated males most often wear a closely wrapped kilt which extends to their knees. Standing males wear a kilt of similar length, but with an overlapped front flap projecting forward in a triangle, and the interior edge hanging in an elongated triangle pendant between the legs. Male wigs generally fall into two categories; one type falls in a gentle curve from the forehead to well below shoulder level and is occasionally decorated with parallel horizontal striations. On the other type, a horizontal line extends beyond the profile and delineates bangs. The rest of the hair falls in a pronounced curve from in front of the ear to just below the shoulders. Women wear sheath dresses on which both shoulder straps are generally indicated. The straps increase dramatically in width from shoulder to bodice, forming a wide \u201cV\u201d which is bisected by a lock of hair. A concave-leg offering table supporting stemless reed leaves is a prominent feature of this group. The leaves may be either wide-bladed, 50 Presumably another element of the offering chapel would have contained an offering formula. For a discussion of these stelae particularly as individual components of Abydene stela chapels, see Simpson, Terrace, p. 15.\n332\n20 FREED Page 333 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:25 PM\nRita E.

To its right, and beneath or beside it may rest a tall \u00a2s jar or libation set. To the left of the table leg, db\u00a2t-\u00a2tp (offerings) is frequently inscribed, and above, often \u221e\u00a3 (thousand) signs accompany the hieroglyphs for the foods and material goods enumerated in the offering formula. Less often, a thin mat or a low table placed above or beside the reed leaves contains additional items. Comments. The \u201cAttenuated Figures Group\u201d is both the largest and chronologically the latest of the workshops presented here. Its member stelae are also the most homogeneous in both relief style and attributes. There is less variation in the positions of figures and greater spacing among them.There is also a tendency toward carelessness which is particularly noticeable in the angular cutting of the minor figures. The compositions are generally spare, including few offerings and showing little attention to individual detail. Although they are not unappealing, their simplicity and overall sameness suggests that they were hastily carved. Within that uniformity, a few individual hands may nevertheless be noted. Clearly CG 20546 and BM 162, (both ANOC 2) were carved by the same artist, who may have also carved BM 839, Berlin 1188, CG 20091, CG 20094, CG 20285, and CG 20531. Similarly, CG 20567 and CG 20568 (both ANOC 39), are from the same hand,51 also possibly responsible for Louvre C 172. Another hand carved CG 20091 and CG 20285. Another: CG 20090, Berlin 1200, and Guimet 11324. Another: CG 20526. Another: Berlin 1183, Louvre C 176, Louvre C 181, BM 576, and BM 828. Another: BM 241, Louvre C 180, and Guimet 10. Another: Oriental Institute 9920, CG 20697, and BM 576. Because so many more stelae have survived from this workshop than from any other, because so many individual hands can be identified, and because the variation in composition and attention to detail and execution is so dramatically reduced, one may infer that by the reign of Amenemhat II a greater demand for stelae has led to short cuts in the stela-making process. These shortcuts include the widespread use of sunk relief, the sameness of pose, a lack of time-consuming intricate details, and an overall simplicity of format. Moreover, a number of stelae contain names and titles in hieratic (CG 20090) or in hieroglyphs that seem cursorily rendered compared to the hieroglyphs of the offering formula (CG 20300), or to precisely executed figural carving (CG 20139).\n51 Ibid.\n333\n20 FREED Page 334 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:25 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nThis suggests that at least some stelae were now available from a readymade, generic stock, which could be personalized after purchase. On the basis of the dated stelae, this workshop endured for at least twenty years. Conclusion In addition to what they show us about the make-up of stela workshops, private stelae from the reigns of Amenemhat I, Sesostris I, and Amenemhat II provide a rich illustration of the art historical creativity of the time and mirror its political changes. Of the 123 stelae in this study, twenty-three are dated by cartouche, thirteen are datable on the basis of the identity of their owners or specific aspects of style, attributes, or inscriptional information, and an additional eighty-seven are attributed to a given reign (or reigns) based on their inclusion in a dated or datable workshop. When not only dated stelae, but also stelae in dated or datable workshops are considered, much more material is available from which trends may be observed. Stela workshops discussed here fall roughly into three groups, corresponding approximately to the three reigns. The earliest workshops, specifically the \u201cColorful Theban Group\u201d and \u201cFew Standing Figures Group\u201d were headquartered at Thebes, where the capital was presumably still located. The former follows very closely the style of painting and relief found in the tombs of the royal courtiers, Dagy and Meketre, believed to date to the reign of Mentuhotep III and Amenemhat I respectively.52 It is possible both workshops were established in Dynasty 11 and continued into Dynasty 12. Whether or not the earliest member stelae were made in Dynasty 11, their debt to the post-reunification style is readily discernible. Although both groups may be contemporary, the \u201cFew Standing Figures Group\u201d bears the stamp of Northern influence in its relief style, and it is this style that prevails, with some modification, well into the reign of Sesostris I. When the capital moved northward to \u2044\u2020-t\u00a3wy, it appears that the center of stela production also shifted northward, but only as far as Abydos. Regardless of whether it preceded the move, it is not surprising that the \u201cFleshy Features Group,\u201d probably the earliest Abydene workshop, reflects a Theban influence in its occasional non-canonical proportions. It is noteworthy that fully seven stelae included here are dated by cartouche and year date to Year 9 or 10 of the reign of Sesostris I. These seven stelae belong to five different workshops (\u201cFleshy Features,\u201d \u201cVer52 See\n334\ndiscussion on p. 302 of this article and especially n. 15.\n20 FREED Page 335 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:25 PM\nRita E.

At no point later in the dynasty does such a diversity of styles exist at the same time. Politically, the middle years of the reign of Sesostris I were a time of stability, and stela workshops appear to have flourished. Although different workshops are identifiable, there is also much more similarity among them, particularly in relief style, than previously. The mature raised relief style of Sesostris I (seen particularly in the \u201cLarge Male,\u201d \u201cIncised False Door,\u201d and \u201cMany Active Figure\u201d workshops) is higher, thereby permitting more plastic modeling. On the face of the owner of Leiden V, 2, for example (\u201cLarge Male\u201d workshop), a depression surrounds the eye, parallels the nose, and separates the face from the neck. A fold of flesh marks the corner of the nostril. Such realistic modeling is often accompanied by delicate touches of incised detail, as the feathering of a duck\u2019s wing on British Museum 585 in the \u201cLarge Male Group,\u201d and the painstakingly executed jars carried in net bags on Louvre C 167 or Cairo, CG 20561 (both in the \u201cMany Active Figures\u201d workshop). These skillfully executed touches demonstrate a confidence derived from experience in relief carving. Virtually all include canonical figures. The combination of plastic modeling and finely incised detailing which unites the Abydene workshops after the first decade of Sesostris I\u2019s reign is characteristic of both royal and private works of the same period made elsewhere. On the White Chapel of Sesostris I at Thebes, for example, the reliefs are covered with painstakingly incised detail.53 The face of the nomarch Ukh-hotep in his tomb at Meir54 is marked by plastic modeling similar to what is seen on Leiden V 2. Although reliefs from each region maintain some of their own idiosyncrasies, these broad characteristics bear testimony to a trend toward country-wide artistic unity. There is also a tendency for the content of a stela to be more complex at this time and to feature more figures in a greater variety of poses. For example, Leiden V 4 from the \u201cMany Active Figures\u201d workshop shows figures in a series of \u201caction poses,\u201d one mashing grain, another trussing a bull, and numerous male and female attendants bringing a wide variety of offerings. The \u201cIncised False Door Group\u201d is so named because of the inclusion, on four of its member stelae, of a complete 53 P. 54 A.\nLacau and H. Ch\u00e9vrier, Une Chapelle de S\u00e9sostris I \u00e0 Karnak (Cairo, 1951), plates. Blackman, The Rock Tombs of Meir II (London, 1915), pl.

The combination of the false door, the offering bearers, and the scenes of daily life means that most of the repertoire of an entire chapel is included within these stelae. In the reign of Amenemhat II, the high, plastic modeling, intricate detailing, and complex compositions which characterize the workshops flourishing under Sesostris I give way to a less detailed, more mechanical style, probably as the result of increased demand. This is seen particularly in the \u201cElongated Skull\u201d and \u201cAttenuated Figures\u201d workshops. All those stelae were executed in sunk relief, which is both easier and faster to carve than raised relief. In the latter workshop particularly, not only is the amount of detailing reduced, but there are fewer figures and fewer offerings. The repertoire of poses is limited, and generally the figures assume more passive positions, thereby demanding less creativity on the part of the artisans. By far the largest workshop, with thirty-nine stelae carved by several identified hands, the \u201cAttenuated Figures Group\u201d exhibits a decided carelessness with regard to the canon, each artisan seeming to have his own variant. Accordingly, within the same workshop, legs, arms, torsos, and necks may be too long or too short, or too fat or too thin, particularly on the minor figures. No workshop can be dated exclusively to the reign of Sesostris II, although it is not out of the question that the \u201cAttenuated Figures\u201d workshop continued that late. Following that reign, the production of stelae, like pottery, grave goods, and many other aspects of the material life of Egyptian society underwent significant changes reflecting the wholesale reorganization of the country that occured under Sesostris III, and the new world vision that was promulgated.55\nb\n55 For\nan overview of these changes and their reasons, see J.

Perhaps the most significant architectural adoptions and revisions are the use of the rectangular Abydos enclosure form, with antecedents in the early First Dynasty (Djer),9 and the mimicking, in the placement of the original mastaba, of Khasekhemwy\u2019s placement of a mound in the northwest quadrant of his Second Dynasty enclosure (the antecedents for which may go back to the Temple of Hierakonpolis).10 Numerous other adoptions and revisions draw on Saqqara as well as Abydos traditions.11 Djoser\u2019s complex is located on the highest ground of the Saqqara plateau,12 suggesting a desire to incorporate into his funerary monument the regenerative notion of the primeval hill, a mythological form also manifested in the pyramid. This great rectangular complex is surrounded by a niched palace wall enclosing structures that include the pyramid, heb sed court to the east, the south tomb below the southern wall, and a great ws\u221et-broad court to the south of the pyramid, in which were two sets of territorial markers around which Djoser was understood (as illustrated on the underground reliefs) to have run as part of the sed festival. Statues played a major role in the complex, where they appear to have been vehicles for regeneration.13 Abundant niches suggest that much statuary, most now lost, originally filled the architecture, including the famous statue base with the king\u2019s feet subjugating the Nine Bows and the r\u221eyt,14 a typical palace theme akin to the smiting scene, the subject of which is underscored by the limestone heads of foreign prisoners also found in the entrance colonnade.15 The statue\u2014of which 9\nD.

Using an interpretation of the pedestal inscription based on a Pyramid Text reading, Helck suggests that the king was reborn as an \u00a3\u221e through this statue by means of the effective actions of Horus and Thoth, \u201cthe two brothers of bjtj,\u201d who he believes are mentioned in the inscription.17 An even clearer example of statuary as a vehicle for rebirth is the serdab statue to the northeast of the pyramid, which faced the Circumpolar Stars, site of regeneration in the Pyramid Texts.18 Sculpture once filled the heb sed court, where its shrines, doorways and niches show that statuary, whether of king or gods, was predominantly oriented to the east (on the west side of the court) and to the south (on the east side of the court).19 These orientations are relevant to our understanding of the relief sculpture beneath the pyramid and south tombs. For about 30 m below and to the east of both the pyramid and South Tomb are corridors that are entered from the north. Each corridor has three doorways that contain relief panels showing the king standing or running. The relief images, each set almost a meter off the ground as though on a pedestal, I believe, are to be undersood as statues.20 The perimeter of each doorway is surrounded with the titulary of the king,21 while the design of the corridor with recessed doorways recalls his palace facade, the design of which is repeated in a variant and larger form on the enclosure wall above ground. The subjects of the relief panels (figs. 1a\u2013f) are Djoser\u2019s ritual acts during the Sed festival, as he stands in the shrines of the gods, runs the 15\nFor a discussion of these and related heads probably also from the complex, see B.V.

The reliefs replicate subject matter (and sometimes format) from the Early Dynastic ticket labels (e.g., the race between territorial markers on a Den label) and sed-related Palermo Stone year entries (e.g., for a statue of Khasekhemwy), as well as from the Narmer Palette (the theme of subjugation and victory) and the Narmer Macehead (the race between markers that later becomes part of the sed festival).22 The reliefs are to be read in sequence from right to left, that is, north to south, in the direction in which the king faces, just as in the contemporary tomb of Hesy-Re, one reads and walks from left to right in the direction in which Hesy faces (i.e., south) as he stands or sits within the niche doorways of his corridor. Read from the right, the Djoser reliefs show the king as he stands, runs, runs, runs, stands, and stands again. Very briefly, the first panel (fig. 1a) shows the king standing in what is labeled the shrine of Horus the Behedite. The inscriptions in four of the panels (figs. 1 a, b, e, f) label as a shrine the site in which Djoser stands or runs, and in all six panels I believe he is understood as though within a shrine. And just as the images of Hesy are oriented south in the direction he faces, but are also understood frontally, which is east,23 so Djoser\u2019s standing and running images are to be understood in dual orientation, i.e., south in the direction in which he faces and east toward the viewer. Two signs always situated behind the king ( ) have been shown 24 to be abbreviated sky glyphs, the dual form suggesting the upper and netherworlds,25 pt and Nwt,26 whose mirror-imaged sky vaults bracket the cosmic stage on which Djoser is the main player.

Through that gate he could run around the complex in the p\ufb02r \u00a2\u00a3 \u00a1nb ritual of circuiting the capital walls, which occurred at the accession of the king and as a renewal of his reign in the sed festival.

In the first panel under the south tomb (fig. 1d) the king completes the run, the orientation of all glyphs but one shifting direction in order to signal his change of direction around the markers above ground.29 He is understood to have run across the court above ground (fig. 4) in order to circuit the markers and/or run out of the dummy gateway on the south wall.30 The final two reliefs (figs. 1e\u2013f) show the king after the completed run as he \u2122\u00a2\u2122-stands in shrines, crowned as king of Lower and then Upper Egypt. The shrines in which the king is depicted have their three-dimensional correlate above ground in the heb sed court. Though there is no one-to-one correlation between the underground relief shrine references and the above ground actual shrines, the statue context for both links them closely. The southern and eastern orientations of the panel statue figures underground correspond to the mainly southern and eastern orientation of the doorway and niche statuary that once stood in the heb sed shrines or embedded in the pedestals on which the shrines sit31 above ground. The relationship is purely schematic, however, without any correlation in size between the panel figures and doorway or niche dimensions. (And some of the shrine statuary was surely of gods.32) The doorways of the underground reliefs of the king are bordered by the royal titulary and surrounded by greenish-blue faience tiles in the form of bound reeds.33 The reed motif recalls both the earthly reed mat28 A term used by Barry J. Kemp in\nAncient Egypt: Anatomy of a Civilization (London and New York, 1989), pp. 59\u201362, esp. p. 62. 29 The designer obviously realized that to reverse the orientation of the sign with the corner of the buttressed wall would have rendered the glyph illegible. 30 Sed festival statues of a running king are best represented by the figures of Tuthmosis III in the tomb of Rekhmire: N. de Garis Davies, The Tomb of Rekh-mi-re at Thebes (New York, 1943; reprinted by Arno Press, 1973), pls. 36, 37. 31 M.

Djoser\u2019s predecessor, Khasekhemwy, may have had such notions in mind when he used smaller similarly glazed plaques in his Abydos tomb.36 And such ideas may also have been relevant for the dwelling of the gods, as illustrated by palm tree and other vegetal inlays or tiles from the archaic Osiris temple at Abydos,37 the archaic temple at Hierakonpolis, and earlier as well as contemporary temple tiles at Elephantine.38 Djoser was thus drawing on an already established faience tradition and the regenerative meaning it probably carried in early tomb and temple contexts. All facets of regenerative watery creation are indicated in the Djoser complex: the primeval ocean in the tiled rooms,39 the watery vault of heaven above, and (fig. 2) its netherworld counterpart below. But there is also the terrestrial plane of earth, Egypt, which the king assumes in his run,40 below which is an underworld plane with the two tombs41 (fig. 3). The sky above, the sky below, and earth and underworld are understood in an accordion-like vertical expansion of layered planes. 34 Cf.\nPyr. 1010b and 1985c.\n35 For the multiple meanings of\nw\u00a3\u2202, see most recently F.L.

The author wonders whether the blue was intended to ensure the protection of the king or merely arose from the manufacturing technique. But examples of Djoser faience tiles with originally reddish brown glaze (A.J. Spencer, Catalogue of Egyptian Antiquities in the British Museum V: Early Dynastic Objects [London, 1980], Cat. 524, EA 2444; Cat. 525, EA 2445), presumably furniture inlays, show that other colorants could have been used and thus suggests that the blue-green glaze of the Djoser tiles was deliberate. 36 See Spencer, Catalogue, nos. 502\u2013507 for Khasekhemwy glazed plaques, and thirteen glazed plaques from an inlay (no. 508) from Sakkara, Tomb 3504, mid-First Dynasty, reign of Djet.

Within the larger palace walls are also smaller palace structures, like the one in the entrance corridor, Temple T42 beside the sed court, possibly the south tomb itself,43 and the building north of the pyramid44 (more often called the mortuary temple), as well as the underground palace equivalents in the corridors beneath the pyramid and south tomb. There are ws\u221et-broad courts that echo across the superstructure, from the huge moat in the form of a ws\u221et-glyph that encloses the complex,45 to ws\u221et-glyph-shaped corridors in the heb sed shrines, to the ws\u221etcourts northeast and south of the pyramid, to those between the heb sed shrines, and others south of the House of the North and south of the House of the South. Ws\u221et is further echoed in the substructure in what I believe are ws\u221et-glyph references on two of the relief panels, the most southern beneath the pyramid and the most northern beneath the south tomb (figs. 1c and d).46 The nesting of form within form, idea within idea, yields intensified resonating notions of each, from below ground to above and above ground to below. There are also architectural and sculptural features with complementary orientations, such as the south tomb oriented east\u2013west and its complement the pyramid tomb oriented north\u2013south, so that Djoser\u2019s spirit ascends from the south tomb into the west and from the pyramid tomb into the north, the west and the northern Circumpolar Stars being two celestial afterlife abodes in Old Kingdom religious thinking. The west and north also complement the subterranean relief orientations, namely, south and east, thus enabling the king to move toward all four 41\nE.

And finally, the great court markers south of the pyramid are oriented to a southern gate, complemented by (originally two) markers in the court of the House of the South oriented to what was once a northern gate.47 And there are parallel features, like the north\u2013south orientation of both the south tomb and pyramid corridors and their panel images; or the great court to the south of the pyramid with a statue chamber in its southwest corner that may have originally been planned to parallel the court to the north(east) of the pyramid with a southwest statue chamber (i.e., the serdab). Complementary and parallel features encompass all four cardinal points as well as up to down and down to up (as when the subterrranean panels of the king are to be understood above and below ground); and not necessarily sequentially, but at one and the same time, so that the complex is experienced as a single narrative. These layered, complementary and parallel features suggest an attempt on the part of the designer to \u201craise to a higher coefficient of reality\u201d48 all cosmic elements necessary to ensure the King\u2019s eternal life in the terrestrial and celestial, earthly and divine realms. Considering the Dynasty 0 and Early Dynastic sources from which Djoser borrowed architecturally and sculpturally, it would not be surprising to find antecedents for this layered, cosmic construct. I identify one such antecedent in the Narmer Palette, a monument that established, as Baines notes, \u201can iconographic definition of the Egyptian cosmos, which set the pattern for later periods.\u201d49 It is a monument that incorporates, repeats and modifies subjects from earlier palettes that cannot be discussed here. Baines analyzes the palette as a description of the ordered cosmos in which the human/cow heads (i.e., Bat), along with the Horus (sky god) serekh at top, denote the sky realm; the central relief areas, with king and subjugation scenes (and entwined symbolic beasts on the front), denote the \u2018world;\u2019 and the fleeing enemies on the lowest register refer to \u201cwhat is outside and \u2018beneath\u2019 the ordered cosmos.\u201d50 Interpreting Baines\u2019s description graphically (fig. 5) yields a three-part separation of the two-dimensional registered scenes into a tiered spatial conception in which the sky51 lies above the world/earth, which in turn 47 Ibid.,\np. 14 and n. 77. a phrase of Bernard Berenson on Florentine Renaissance art. 49 J.

The king participates in all these realms\u2014as the implicit Horus falcon in heaven, as king and subjugator in the world, and as repeller of chaos in the sphere beyond order52\u2014and he is the dominant player in this cosmic schema.53 Djoser expands and modifies the cosmic construct inherent in the Narmer Palette within a process of repetitions and revisions that echo throughout the complex, all of them part of a long \u201cchain of replications,\u201d54 to use a phrase from Davis in his analysis of late predynastic palettes.55 Davis shows how the palettes repeat and revise one another\u2019s graphic and metaphoric vocabulary with the result that each can only be fully understood within the \u201creplicatory sequence.\u201d56 Djoser\u2019s monument is, I believe, part of such a sequence. In the underground panels he drew on the format and subject matter of Early Dynastic ticket labels and sed-related Palermo Stone entries, and borrowed subject matter from the Dynasty 0 Narmer Palette and Narmer Macehead.57 Architecturally, he borrowed and expanded on the plan of the Early Dynastic enclosures at Abydos, among many other sources. But from the Narmer Palette (and undoubtedly from other yet unidentified monuments), he does more than adopt themes. He borrows and expands on its very cosmic construct. From a formal point of view, the complex is much like a gigantic Narmer Palette, whose registers have been separated into successive layers and then dramatically expanded into three dimensions.58 But while the Narmer Palette has a verso (like most palettes) that must be turned over and read in conjunction with the front, the two sides usually understood as a unit, Djoser\u2019s complex cannot be inverted. It must be read by moving in all directions on a single level as well as through the layered images from above and below at the same time, embracing multiple parts above ground and below ground, including visible images (statues) and invisible images (the running figures in the court; 51 Possibly\na dual, as suggested by the two Bat heads on each side of the palette. Baines, Antiquity 63 (1989), p. 475. 53 The primacy accorded the king is also emphasized by his magnified view on the back of the palette. And see W. Davis, Masking the Blow (Berkeley, Los Angeles, Oxford, 1992), pp. 123\u201324. 54 Ibid., passim and esp. pp. 8\u201320 and Chs. 2\u20136. 55 E.g., the Oxford, Hunter\u2019s, Battlefield and Narmer Palettes. 56 Ibid., p. 6. 57 Friedman, JARCE 32, passim and esp. p. 42. 58 It seems unlikely that such a cosmic construct should have been used architecturally only by Djoser. Since Djoser\u2019s is the earliest surviving stone complex, the others in more perishable materials may not have survived well enough to reveal such an intent. One may speculate that other monuments, possibly the Abydos or other rectangular enclosures at Saqqara, may have been originally designed with such inherent cosmologies. 52 See\n348\n21 FRIEDMAN Page 349 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:26 PM\nFlorence Dunn Friedman, Notions of Cosmos in the Step Pyramid Complex\nFig. 4.

It is Djoser, through his images above and below ground, who, like Narmer, links and integrates the parts. And as Narmer takes center stage as the king writ large on the back of his palette, so Djoser takes center stage in the Great ws\u221et-Court as a projected statue presence. But here he is more than a subjugator of enemies and territorial claimant: this Netjerykhet, the \u201cDivine One of the Corporation (of Gods),\u201d is a cosmic claimant, seizing heaven and earth and the eternal office of kingship, and thereby effecting his royal and cosmic role as maintainer of Maat. And as he maintains this cosmos, so is he regenerated by it\u2014through its primeval hill, primordial reed-filled waters, celestial and underworld heavens, and the once abundant statuary within its palaces, niches and shrines.\nb\n351\n22 GOEDICKE Page 353 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:28 PM\nA Special Toast\nHans Goedicke\nA\nlthough the Egyptians were ardent lovers of beer from the earliest times on, it was certainly not the only beverage they cherished. Wine as well has a very long history in Egypt. While extensive information is available about the preparation of these two drinks, much less is known about others, and this applies not only to their preparation but also to their degree of appreciation in the society. A rare bit of information is contained among the inscriptions in the tomb of a certain Sw-m-n\u00a1wt, who was closely attached to the retinue of Amenophis II.1 It is my intention to offer the following observations as an Egyptological toast to the jubilee celebrant with my sincere wishes. As far as I am aware, the texts in Sw-m-n\u00a1wt\u2019s tomb have not received much attention.2 The activity which the text annotates is carried out by men on ladders apparently involved in harvesting, and depicts as well trays with the fruits of this labor in booths. Sw-m-n\u00a1wt attends this activity in his capacity as \u201cking\u2019s butler\u201d (wb\u00a3 (n) nswt)3 with the recurrent laudatory epithet \u201cclean of hands.\u201d4 What makes it so interesting is the implication that officials in personal contact with the king were required to adhere to specific standards of purity. Such an obligation would make it most likely that he was excluded from any physical involvement in the preparation of royal condiments and that his role was one of supervision.\n1 TT\n92; PM I/12, pp. 187\u201389. Urk. IV, 1449. Basically, there is the translation by Wolfgang Helck, Urkunden der 18. Dynasty, German edition (Berlin, 1961), p. 103 and its English version by Barbara Cumming, Egyptian Historical Records of the Later Eighteenth Dynasty, Fascicle II (Warminster, 1984), p. 144f. 3 Alan H. Gardiner, Ancient Egyptian Onomastica I (London, 1947), p. 43*f. 4 It is apparent, of course, that it might refer to the man\u2019s cleanliness in executing his office. However, while hygienic concerns might be implied, it would seem likely that the epithet conveys more than the fact that Sw-m-n\u00a1wt was in the habit of keeping his hands clean. It seems rather likely that the epithet reflects a specific degree of purity, but it could also be interpreted metaphorically as \u201cwith clean hands,\u201d i.e., free of improper actions. The continuation of the epithet w\u2122b \u2122wy as wdnw n \u2044mn (Urk. IV, 1459.19) suggests that Sw-m-n\u00a1wt observed ritual purity in his service to the king, as would have been necessary for him in his capacity for offering to Amun. 2\n22 GOEDICKE Page 354 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:28 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nThis supervisory role on the upper part of the tomb\u2019s west wall is specified as m\u00a3\u00a3 bw-nfr nw pr-nswt \u2202srw \u00a1\u00a3tt, and accompanies various activities connected with the preparation of beverages, the whole filling five registers.5 It concerns the making of beer from the measuring of grain for making bread to its fermentation in huge vessels. An obviously different kind of drink is contained in smaller jars of a different type. Swm-n\u00a1wt\u2019s activity was understood by Helck as \u201cInspizieren des Guten des K\u00f6nigspalastes, des Milchgetr\u00e4nks durch\u2026 S,\u201d while B. Cumming gave for it \u201cInspecting the good things in the royal palace, milky ale, by \u2026 S.\u201d Considering the associated array of activities it can be assumed from the outset that the attached annotation is summary in nature. This, however, does not confirm the previous renderings which disregard the pictographic record in their lack of any reference to the depicted comestibles. While \u2202srw and \u00a1\u00a3tt are indicated as beverages, the preced= ing is not. Neither Helck\u2019s \u201cdas Gute des K\u00f6nigspalastes\u201d nor B. Cumming\u2019s \u201cthe good things in the royal palace\u201d appear to capture the full meaning. Bw-nfr is in a genitival connection with pr-nswt;6 the use of the plural genitival adjective nyw makes it clear that bw-nfr is a plural (or collective). The term, which might have its origin in the vernacular, is rare before the Ptolemaic Period.7 Like English \u201cgoodies\u201d bw-nfr appears to denote especially cherished edibles and requires a rendering \u201cdelicacies.\u201d It would seem doubtful that pr-nswt denotes here specifically the \u201croyal palace,\u201d as this would narrow its application unnecessarily. As Sw-m-n\u00a1wt in this connection holds the epithet \u201croyal follower at his moves on southern and northern foreign countries,\u201d it would seem better to take pr-nswt as inclusively as possible, i.e., denoting any place of the king, which does not rule out the existence of an ideal fare associated with the royal household, just as there are Western traditions about \u201croyal cuisine.\u201d\n\u2044J iW\n5 Walter\nWreszinski, Atlas zur alt\u00e4gyptischen Kulturgeschichte I (Leipzig, 1923), pls. 295, 296. 6 This fact stands against the rendering by B. Cumming. 7 A Late Egyptian occurrence is pLansing 15, 2 \u201ceverybody who acquaints you in festivity is with goodies;\u201d the rendering differs somewhat from that by A.M. Blackman and T.E. Peet, \u201cPapyrus Lansing: A Translation with Notes,\u201d JEA 11 (1925), p. 298 and Ricardo A. Caminos, Late Egyptian Miscellanies (London, 1954), p. 421 in separating the two prepositional adjuncts. The latter had connected both with the addressee as \u201cwhoever beholds you is festive with good cheer.\u201d Instead, I understand the passage to mean that anybody who gets in touch with the celebrating teacher is instantly invited to partake of the goodies. Wb. I, p. 452.9 lists bw-nfr with the meaning \u201cBrot,\u201d but the occurrences, such as Edfu I, 91, 92, etc. suggest a more inclusive meaning of the term.\n354\n22 GOEDICKE Page 355 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:28 PM\nHans Goedicke, A Special Toast\n\u00cesrw \u00a1\u00a3tt has occurred as a compound since the Fourth Dynasty8 although it has also been considered as two separate items. There is some justification to this, as \u00a1\u00a3tt denotes a milk product while \u2202srw applies to beer. Helck combined the two into a \u201cMilchgetr\u00e4nk\u201d followed by B. Cumming as \u201cmilky ale.\u201d The notion of combining milk with beer made of fermented bread is technically improbable and fantastic as far as taste is concerned. Any addition of milk to a fermented or fermenting brew would make it curdle instantly. \u2044\u00a3tt does not denote \u201cmilk\u201d proper, but rather the result of a process the milk goes through. The latter has two distinct stages: one is the raising of the cream to the top, the other the settling of the firm parts from the whey. In either case there is a distinction between a lower and an upper layer; it is the latter which I envision denoted as \u00a1\u00a3tt.9 As for \u2202srw, it is not the common term for \u201cbeer,\u201d which is \u00a2nqt. This suggests that \u2202srw denotes something special in the beer production.10 The term is probably connected with the verb \u2202sr, \u201cto separate\u201d or \u201cto raise,\u201d and might reflect the fermentation process when the liquid separates from the mash. Caminos11 rendered it \u201cstrong ale,\u201d but it might denote a particular, apparently cherished stage in the making of beer. I would surmise it to be specifically the initial fermentation of the cereal material, i.e., the time when the alcohol content was the highest. The attached specification \u00a1\u00a3tt could apply, as pointed out before, when the separation had taken place and the beverage was at its best. To reflect these particulars a rendering \u201ccream ale\u201d might be appropriate. The second scene, depicted on the east wall, shows Sw-m-n\u00a1wt inspecting harvesting activity. Despite the seemingly horticultural nature of the depicted activity, its ultimate purpose is the preparation of a beverage. It is again a result of Sw-m-n\u00a1wt\u2019s position as \u201cking\u2019s butler\u201d that he supervises, at least theoretically, this activity. The scene, to judge from a photograph taken by the late Siegfried Schott (see fig. 1),12 is not easily understandable in its details, so that the accompanying brief text is of special importance. Helck13 rendered this text as \u201cInspizieren der 8 Winfried\nBarta, Die alt\u00e4gyptische Opferliste, M\u00c4S 3 (Berlin, 1963), p. 43. the writing with the sign \u00ac is not entirely clear, it would seem feasible to connect the word either with \u00a1\u00a3t, \u201ckom, mount\u201d or with \u00a1\u00a3w, \u201caged.\u201d Either one would seem appropriate for the process milk passes through. 10 Cf.

The theme of the connected picture does not support a reference to a \u201cmeal\u201d as the focal point in the description. Equally unlikely is the notion of a \u201cdrinking bout\u201d (\u201cTrinkgelage\u201d), especially its performance \u201cfor Pharaoh\u201d (\u201cdas f\u00fcr Pharao gemacht wird\u201d), which would give the impression of a drinking competition in honor of the Pharaoh. That the shown activity is \u201cfor the drink supply of the Residence\u201d would require a rather limited number of residents or a vast production to satisfy a sizable population.

Although given in this form in the Urkunden, Helck subsequently emended it to \u2122bw- m .15 This term is repeatedly attested and rendered as \u201cMahlzeit, Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck.\u201d16 While the occurrences in the offering list do not provide a basis for establishing the nature of the repast meant by \u2122bw-r\u00a3, its mention among \u2044n\u00a3n\u00a3\u2019s and Sn-m-\u00a1\u2122\u00a2\u2019s inscriptions helps somewhat in advancing the question. \u2044n\u00a3n\u00a3 brags,17 \u201cAs I am in the favor of His Majesty daily, I am supplied from the king\u2019s table with bread of the king\u2019s \u2122bw-r\u00a3 and beer, likewise fat meat, vegetables and various fruits, honey, cakes and wine, as well as oil.\u201d18 Since \u201cbread and beer\u201d are usually associated in the offering list as integral parts of the king\u2019s \u2122bw-r\u00a3, the same should be assumed here. Not clear is if the other foodstuff should be seen as typical of the \u2122bw-r\u00a3 or if it was an unusual extension beyond the customary. In either case the fare would seem excessively heavy for \u201cbreakfast\u201d if it is considered the initial food intake in the morning.19 Similar doubts about the nature of \u2122bw-r\u00a3 as \u201cbreakfast\u201d result from Sn-m-\u00a1\u2122\u00a2\u2019s claim \u201cone brought me servings20 at the time of day and night with things of the king\u2019s \u2122bw-r\u00a3.\u201d It would seem unlikely that one distributed items of the royal breakfast by night. Both passages suggest that \u2122bw-r\u00a3, lit. \u201ccleaning the mouth,\u201d is more an elegant term for a fancy repast, especially the king\u2019s, without the implication of a specific time when it was consumed.21\n3 2\n15 This\nreading is repeated by B.

From the following m \u221et nt \u2122bw-r\u00a3 it is clear that b\u00a3kb\u00a3k consisted of things of the royal repast, thus requiring a more inclusive meaning of b\u00a3kb\u00a3k. Using b\u00a3k, \u201cto serve,\u201d as the root from which the reduplicated word might be derived, a rendering \u201cserving (of food)\u201d would not only suit the context but also the etymology. 16\n21 One\ncould possibly compare it with degustation which has a wide range of applications.\n357\n22 GOEDICKE Page 358 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:28 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\n3\nTempting as the proposed emendation might seem, the epigraphic situation is unambiguous (see fig. 1). The signs m and m have nothing in common, neither in the hieroglyphic nor in the hieratic, which could inspire a confusion. Disregarding the possibility of a freak error, which, of course, is always a remote possibility, it seems necessary to take the extant text seriously. That the term is a compound is certain as is the first element \u2122bw \u201ccleansings.\u201d It is also certain that it ultimately concerns a beverage as it is destined for a \u201cdrinker\u201d (n swr\u00a1). The ideographic spelling m allows only reading \u00a2nn or, less likely, b\u2122\u00a2. A literal rendering of the compound term would be \u201ccleansing the phallus.\u201d Its mention on the wall can be interpreted in two ways. It is either an intentional, sarcastic substitute for r\u00a3 \u201cmouth,\u201d or else the topic of the scene is the preparation of a beverage to increase the consumer\u2019s potency. As we do not know what it is made from, the question has to remain open. What Sw-m-n\u00a1wt is observing is thus not the preparation of the king\u2019s breakfast, which would have gotten him into the orchards at a very early hour. The depicted activity, however, has a specific recipient indicated as n p\u00a3 swr\u00a1 n \ufb02nw and does not refer to a drinking orgy of the palace, as Helck\u2019s translation might suggest. This \u201cdrinker of the Residence\u201d is nobody else than the tomb\u2019s owner Sw-m-n\u00a1wt. The determinative does not concern the activity of drinking, but rather indicates its doer, who was paying a visit to his estate in the countryside. In the following are two participial qualifications which are intertwined, thus causing some difficulty for the previous translators. Helck apparently connected with p\u00a3 swr\u00a1, in which B. Cumming followed him. The participle should qualify the last preceding masculine word, i.e., \ufb02nw, which, of course, would make no sense. The idiom \u00a1r\u00a1 \u00a2r has the meaning \u201cto act on behalf of someone\u201d and not \u201cfor someone.\u201d22 It results that the participle qualifies the gentleman for whom the repast is being prepared by describing his former activity.23 This specification is divided by an intrusive reference to the repast being prepared and should be recognized as \u00a1rw \u00a2r pr-\u2122\u00a3 \u2122n\u221e w\u2202\u00a3 snb\u2026 r s\u2202\u00a3y-\u00a2r n nb-t\u00a3wy s\u221em\u221e-\u00a1b n n\u2020r-nfr, \u201cwho acted on behalf of Pharaoh, L.P.H., in order to amuse the lord of the Two Lands and distract the heart of the n\u2020r-nfr.\u201d If\n|\n|\nu 3\u00a1\n22 B. Cumming was aware of this aspect and thus rendered\np\u00a3 swr\u00a1 n \ufb02nw as \u201cthe drink supply of the Residence.\u201d It should be noted that swr\u00a1 n \ufb02nw is introduced by p\u00a3, which would seem to have here the force of a demonstrative, i.e., \u201cthis drinker of the Residence,\u201d thus making it even clearer as a reference to Sw-m-n\u00a1wt; for the use of p\u00a3, see Burkhart Kroeber, Die Neu\u00e4gyptizismen vor der Amarnazeit (Diss. T\u00fcbingen, 1970), p. 9ff. 23 \u2044rw certainly would seem a past participle, thus concerning Sw-m-n\u00a1wt\u2019s former activity, rather than an imperfective one, which would concern his ongoing activity.\n358\n22 GOEDICKE Page 359 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:28 PM\nHans Goedicke, A Special Toast\nthe different forms of referring to the king have any significance, or if they are mere synonyms remains an open question. Embedded in the description of Sw-m-n\u00a1wt\u2019s activity is the qualifying statement \u2122pr m \u221et nbt nfrt. It is connected neither with the immediately preceding, nor with what follows.24 Its only antecedent is, of course, \u2122bw-r\u00a3, i.e., the \u201crepast\u201d which was \u201cfurnished with every good thing.\u201d25 What they were is not detailed, but according to the picture, fruit is only a part of the repast prepared for the butler Sw-m-n\u00a1wt. In a very clever fashion the scenes and their annotations combine the description of the man\u2019s professional pursuit as king\u2019s butler with his personal outlook towards a permanent record of his interest in good living. It is especially the second scene discussed here that portrays Sw-mn\u00a1wt as an onlooker of the preparation for a repast worthy of the king, which he seems to anticipate for his own enjoyment. In his office he acted on behalf of Pharaoh for the ruler\u2019s pleasure,26 but ultimately he wants to pursue the pleasures he had experienced in the Residence in his own retirement, on earth and hereafter. The epicurean mood of Sw-m-n\u00a1wt is the topic of the wishes addressed to him: \u201cTo your ka, O my father! Drink, get drunk, celebrate a pretty day, O favorite butler!\u201d\nb\n24 Helck\nand B. Cumming both linked it with what follows as if \u2122pr m \u221et nbt nfrt was for the purpose of amusing the lord of the Two Lands. Such an interpretation, however, leads to some contradictions. First, the \u201crepast\u201d observed by Sw-m-n\u00a1wt is \u201cfor the drinker of the Residence,\u201d i.e., himself, so that the reference to the ruler could not concern the meal readied for the tomb\u2019s owner. Second, the past nature of \u2122pr would be contradicted by the intentional r + infinitive, except if the furnishing would have been done with the purpose of amusing the ruler. If the intention had been to mention things which normally were used for the king\u2019s amusement, it should be construed with a genitive. 25 For the use of \u2122pr, cf. Wb. I, p. 180.17. 26 The reflective mood of the inscription is well illustrated by the claim \u00a1r \u00a2sst \u00a1my \u2122\u00a2 m \ufb02rt hrw n r\u2122 nb, \u201cwho did what the one in the palace always praised in the course of every day.\u201d\n359\n23 HARVEY Page 361 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:31 PM\nA Decorated Protodynastic Cult Stand from Abydos\nStephen P. Harvey\nI\nn honor of the distinguished Egyptological career of William Kelly Simpson, I would like to discuss an object that reflects his involvement with Abydos as Co-Director (with David O\u2019Connor) of the University of Pennsylvania\u2013Yale University Expedition to Abydos, as well as his former position as Curator of the Department of Egyptian, Nubian, and Ancient Near Eastern Art of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. I have had the privilege to work for Kelly in Boston, to study with him at Yale, and participate in the work of the Pennsylvania\u2013Yale Expedition, and have greatly benefited in all instances from his teaching 1 and leadership. An important and representative group of objects from the excavations of W.M.F. Petrie in the \u201cOsiris Temple\u201d at Abydos in southern Egypt was distributed in 1903 to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Among the finds from the earliest levels of the temple site was an unusual ceramic jar stand, decorated just below its rim with the figure of a ram (figs. 1\u20132). The ram is surrounded by a row of incised triangles and by numerous partly excised triangles and ovals. Four large fenestrations are placed around the body of the stand. Already in 1902, heavy calcareous accretions obscured the decoration of the lower half of the stand, as can be seen from a contemporary photograph.2 In the course of reorganization and inventory of the storage areas belonging to the Department of Ancient Egyptian, Nubian, and Near 1\nAn earlier version of this paper was originally presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Research Center in Egypt, held in Philadelphia, April 23, 1989. I would especially like to thank Dr. Rita Freed for permission to publish this object, as well as Dr. Peter Lacovara for his tremendous help. Carol Warner, formerly an intern in the Museum of Fine Arts\u2019 Objects Conservation Laboratory, and currently a conservator at the National Park Service Cultural Resources Center, Lowell, Massachusetts, was responsible for painstakingly and skillfully conserving the stand. Yvonne Markowitz provided the excellent illustrations, and Pamela Hatchfield aided in its conservation photography. For suggestions and advice, I would also like to thank Mrs. Barbara Adams, Ms. Brigit Crowell, Dr. G\u00fcnter Dreyer, Dr. Henry G. Fischer, Ms. Ren\u00e9e Friedman, Dr. E. Christiana K\u00f6hler, Dr. Patricia Podzorski, Dr. Ann Macy Roth, Mr. Josef Wegner, and Dr. Richard L. Zettler. Dr. David O\u2019Connor, Dr. David P. Silverman, and Ms. Barbara A.

Surprisingly, the cleaning exposed extensive incised decoration over the lower half of the stand (figs. 2\u20133). Two of the four spaces between the large triangular fenestrations had been decorated before firing with the images of a giraffe standing on a base line and facing a tree. Attached to the back of the neck of one of the giraffes is a rectangle containing three hieroglyphs (figs. 3\u20134). Three excised triangles fill the third panel between fenestrations, while the fourth area contained an incised\n363\n23 HARVEY Page 364 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:31 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nFig. 3. detail of decoration on the jar stand; drawing by Yvonne Markowitz.\ndecoration of two triangles joined in a diamond pattern. The stand bears the accession number MFA 03.1959. While its findspot suggests a cultic function, the information from Petrie\u2019s excavation does not allow for precise dating of the stand. Based on excavated parallels, however, it is likely that it was made and decorated before Dynasty 1, during the period defined in archaeological terms as Naqada IIIa2\u2013IIIc1.3 Thus, the decoration of the stand (including applied, excised, and incised elements) is of considerable interest as an example of the art of Naqada III, a period which is only now being defined through excavation and analysis. The image of the giraffe and plant with inscription attached may in particular provide further insight 3 See now the usefully annotated chronology in J.

Manufacture and Function Sixty-nine centimeters tall, with a maximum diameter at the rim of 17.8 centimeters, the profile of the stand swells towards the base, creating a\n365\n23 HARVEY Page 366 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:31 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nFig. 5. Detail of ram figure (courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston).\nnearly bell-shaped profile.4 The fabric is Nile silt with straw inclusions, and the black core visible in the break at the rim is indicative of firing at a low temperature. The body was probably built by hand, and the rims at both ends display rilling indicative of the use of a slow wheel or tournette. While the stand was leather hard, four large triangles were cut through, and numerous triangles and ovals were partly excised using a knife or spatula. The incised decorations were made with the point of a tool, and the ram figure was made separately and applied to the incised rectangular area near the top of the stand (fig. 5). Interestingly, an area of excess clay near the edge of one of the excised triangles preserves the impression of woven cloth, perhaps from cloth used in wiping the surface smooth. Considerable abrasion around the inside of the mouth of the stand implies that it was actually used to support vessels in antiquity.5 The porosity of the clay and the shape of the stand suggest that its function may have been to cool liquids (perhaps wine or water) through evaporation. Early models and representations of stands indicate that 4 The\nprofile is closely paralleled by another stand (British Museum 38092) from the early levels of the \u201cOsiris Temple\u201d at Abydos; Petrie, Abydos II, pl. 44, no. 104, and pl. 12, no. 270; A.J.

Harvey, A Decorated Protodynastic Cult Stand from Abydos\nthey could be used to support closed-mouth jars, bowls, and tables.6 It is also possible that incense or other materials may have been burned in a censer atop such a stand, but there is no evidence of burning preserved on this example. Archaeological Context Due to the complex nature of the site of the \u201cOsiris Temple\u201d at Abydos, Petrie created a building sequence for the temple with reference to the superposition of walls and objects, the elevations of which were recorded in inches above an arbitrary datum. Petrie assumed a First Dynasty date for the ram stand on the basis of the level at which it was found (178 inches above arbitrary zero).7 A sealing of King Qa\u2122a, the last king of the First Dynasty, was also found at the same elevation in the general area, which Petrie took as an indication of contemporaneity. Barry Kemp\u2019s study of Petrie\u2019s excavation, making use of publications and notes, has demonstrated the great extent to which Petrie\u2019s reliance on relative elevations was insufficient.8 In itself, the elevation of the stand is not very meaningful for precise dating and only implies that the deposition of the stand predates a structure of the Sixth Dynasty (Building H in Kemp\u2019s nomenclature), the floor of which lay well above the stand.9 Based on architectural and textual studies, O\u2019Connor and Brovarski have independently identified Building H as a \u201cka-chapel\u201d of the Sixth Dynasty,10 although other scholars prefer to view it as one of the cult structures devoted to the local god Khentyamentiu.11 6 For\nfaience models of closed-mouth jars on stands, see the following examples: from the \u201cOsiris Temple\u201d at Abydos: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston 03.1736 (unpublished), from the deposit of votive objects known as M69; in the Kofler-Truniger collection, Lucerne, and reportedly from illicit excavation in the \u201cOsiris Temple:\u201d H.W.

Early cult activity is implied by the type of objects found by Petrie in the levels below Building H, including incense burners, hesvases, and numerous tall jar stands.13 The faience, stone, ivory, and ceramic objects from the votive deposit below Building H known as \u201cM69\u201d are often given an Early Dynastic date and they may provide evidence of cultic activity on the site during the earliest dynasties. However, the objects were deposited during the late Old Kingdom, or possibly even later, as Kemp has cautioned.14 Votive deposits appear to be a feature of early Egyptian temples, as similar finds from Hierakonpolis and Elephantine demonstrate.15 The context and dating of these deposits and their contents underscore the need for caution in dating finds from early levels of temple sites at Abydos and elsewhere. In all likelihood, the Abydos ram stand was used in the presentation of offerings, a cultic function of tall stands that is well documented during most phases of pharaonic civilization.16 A representation of a temple dating to the First Dynasty depicts a jar stand inside of the building.17 Ceramic stands are also encountered in funerary contexts in Egypt, either at the entrance to graves18 or in the actual burial chamber.19\n11\nFor example, B.J.

Harvey, A Decorated Protodynastic Cult Stand from Abydos\nDate of the Stand In an early work on the interrelations between Egypt and Mesopotamia as reflected in ceramic finds, Henri Frankfort stated that jar stands did not exist in Egypt prior to the First Dynasty.20 A review of more recent literature indicates that stands were already used during the Naqada III period, some 150 years before the traditional start of Dynasty 1.21 Bowls or beakers with pedestalled bases, which occur already in the Naqada I phase, do not come under consideration here.22 A significant early group of tall Egyptian stands occurs as imports in the series of elite A-Group burials excavated at Qustul by the Oriental Institute, which can be dated, on the basis of their contents, to the late Naqada III period, just before Dynasty 0.23 Although more slender in profile than the Abydos stand, the Qustul stands provide interesting comparanda, since they include examples decorated with rows of excised triangles,24 applied ceramic relief,25 and incised decoration.26 16\nP.P.

Very close in style to the Abydos ram stand is a fragment of a sculptured ceramic support, possibly in the shape of an animal, from the settlement (\u201cOsiris Town\u201d) excavated by Petrie in the vicinity of the \u201cOsiris Temple\u201d at Abydos.28 A circular hole in the top of the fragment may have been used to support a jar, and the exterior is decorated with triangles, both excised and incised. A number of fragments of tall stands with excised triangles have been found at Hierakonpolis Locality HK\u201329a, in a pit dated to early Dynasty 1, which had been cut into the earlier oval \u201ccult structure.\u201d29 Dr. Christiana K\u00f6hler has kindly shown me an example of excised triangle decoration on a cylindrical vessel (possibly a stand) which derives from Level IIIe at Buto, a context dated to Naqada IIIa2/b1.30 Although not securely dated, a fragment of a stand from the temple at Coptos (fig. 6) provides an intriguing parallel to the Abydos ram stand.31 Rows of impressed triangles surround a human figure, the head of which was carried out in applied ceramic relief, with details of the 27 B.

As in the case of the Abydos stand, the context of the Coptos fragment in the lower levels of the Min Temple is too general to allow close dating, but the similarity in decoration and technique of the Coptos fragment to examples from the Naqada III/ Dynasty 0 horizon implies to me a date in this range. As can be seen from the parallels cited above, repeated rows of small excised or impressed triangles seem to be a common feature of many early stands. Petrie (discussing an undated tall stand from Dendera with rows of fully cut-through triangles) suggested that such triangles represent a lattice effect \u201ccopied from stands made of crossing reeds bound together, and plastered with mud,\u201d but no actual examples of organic prototypes have survived.32 Large open fenestrations such as those in 32\nW.M.F.

Similar fenestrations and rows of excised triangles are a feature of Mesopotamian stands of the Early Dynastic I phase from cultic contexts, a fact which which led P. Delougaz, following Frankfort, to suggest influence from Mesopotamia on Egyptian potters.33 Based on recent discussions of synchronisms between Egypt and Mesopotamia, however, Early Dynastic 1 in Mesopotamia is partly synchronous with Dynasty 1 in Egypt, and therefore the examples of stands with excised triangles from Buto and Qustul dating to the Naqada III period actually predate the Mesopotamian examples.34 Decoration and Text Despite the intriguing nature of the newly revealed incised decoration representing giraffes and plants, the figure of a ram at the top of the stand is clearly the dominant image, as it is carried out in applied relief and enclosed in its own rectangular field (figs. 1, 3, and 5). The variety of ram is identifiable through its distinctive straight corkscrew horns, thick mane below the neck, and long tail as the archaic ram, Ovis longipes palaeoaegyptiacus.35 A number of Predynastic and Early Dynastic representations in both animal and anthropomorphic form reflect the early significance of rams.36 Further, several Early Dynastic objects from Abydos explicitly suggest divine connotations for the animal form of the ram.37 This impression is strengthened by the existence in early texts of the names of several deities (most significantly Khnum) worshipped in later times in the form of a ram.38 The name of the god \u00d4rt\u00a1 is determined with a reclining ram as early as the Second Dynasty, as is the name of the related deity \u00ca\u00a3\u00a1-zp-f, who is known from the First Dynasty.39 Both of these deities are known from later texts, in which they appear to relate to the protection of the granary and the herd, according to Kaplony.40 The 33 P.\nDelougaz, Pottery from the Diyala Region, OIP 63 (Chicago, 1952), p. 134, and pls. 45 and 173.

In later tradition, Abydos was not a major cult place for any ram deity.42 However, it is still most likely that the ram on the Boston stand depicts a deity, perhaps Khnum. The pair of giraffes facing plants incised on the lower portion of the stand certainly form the other major symbolic element of the Boston stand (I use here the term symbolic to refer to an image or sign evoking 36\nFor examples in relief similar to the ram on the Boston Abydos stand, see the row of rams on the obverse of the \u201cLibyan Palette,\u201d Cairo CG 14238 (Naqada III in date), M.

The motif of giraffes and trees is known from a variety of finds ranging in date from Naqada III to the First Dynasty. Thus, pairs of giraffes flanking palm trees occur on several slate ceremonial palettes attributed to the Naqada III period,43 as well as on a painted bowl of Naqada IIIb date from Qustul,44 and on a cylinder seal from Helwan dated to the First Dynasty (possibly Aha).45 Unlike these examples, the giraffes of the Abydos stand do not face one another, but consist of a single giraffe before a tree, which in neither instance on the Abydos stand resembles the palms depicted on slate palettes.46 The spiny branches of one of the trees indicate that the acacia is more likely intended, and its leaves are known as a favored food source of the giraffe.47 Aside from its use as a determinative in a few Egyptian words, giraffes (unlike falcons, vultures, rams, or other animals) appear to have evoked few, if any symbolic associations during the pharaonic era, perhaps partly due to the scarcity of giraffes in Egypt in dynastic times.48 Although it is conceivable that the giraffe and plant motif is purely decorative, the placement of an inscription against the neck of one of the giraffes implies a more overt level of symbolism. It is important to note that the rectangle enclosing the inscription was not merely squeezed into the remaining space left between giraffe and fenestration. Rather, all incision was carried out before firing, and the line that forms the right-hand side of the rectangle continues in an unbroken stroke as the neck and one of the forelegs of the giraffe. The giraffe and inscription thus form an integrated unit. The giraffe seems almost to carry the inscription on its neck, in a fashion reminiscent of the later tradition of \u201cpersonified estates,\u201d which bear names of funerary domains on their 43 Examples include the \u201cTwo Dogs Palette,\u201d H.

The ink inscriptions, which consist mostly of the graphic device of an animal or animal part (e.g. fish, bull\u2019s head, scorpion, sea shell) alongside a plant have been explained by Dr. G\u00fcnter Dreyer as the names of royal plantations or other economic entities. This requires taking each animal or animal part as a previously unattested royal name, perhaps of rulers of a local Thinite dynasty preceding the kings of Dynasty 0, while the plant is considered to denote \u201cplantation.\u201d51 Rather than extend Dreyer\u2019s interpretation to the ram stand and suggest the existence of a plantation of \u201cKing Giraffe,\u201d whose existence is entirely unattested, I prefer to interpret all instances of the combination \u201canimal + plant\u201d as graphic emblems that denote particular domains (i.e., \u201cthe giraffe domain,\u201d etc.). Support for an interpretation of the giraffe and plant pair as a graphic device for an estate may be provided by the inscription at the giraffe\u2019s neck. The absence of the vertical lines of the palace fa\u00e7ade rule out the reading of the rectangle as a serekh, and the rectangle is best understood as an early writing of the enclosure (\u00a2wt, Gardiner Sign-list 06).52 Although \u00a2wt in general can refer to economic, administrative, or religious institutions, the names of funerary domains during the Old\nQ\n49\nCf.

No less of a problem is the fact that the study of early incised inscriptions on ceramic vessels (\u201cpotmarks\u201d) has come to be separated from research into the more readily comprehensible inscriptions found on seals, sealings, labels, and written in ink on vessels, despite some overlap between the two general categories.54 Although parallels can be drawn between each of the signs on the stand and signs that occur as both \u201cpotmarks\u201d and \u201cearly hieroglyphs,\u201d their meaning is still elusive.55 The uppermost element, which consists of what is usually interpreted as human arms pointing downwards, with three fingers on each hand, is usually read as either k\u00a3 or s\u221en and is well attested as the Horus name of a ruler of Dynasty 0 (here called King \u201cKa\u201d). Since the name of King \u201cKa\u201d of Dynasty 0 may occur with arms pointing either up or down, (according to the location of the lines of the palace fa\u00e7ade within the serekh), it is possible that the inscription on the Abydos stand may relate to a \u00a2wt, or cultic foundation of King \u201cKa.\u201d56 This attribution agrees well with the date for the stand based on finds from Qustul, Hierakonpolis, and Buto (see discussion above).\n53\nFor example, in the example of the generic term for all of the estates of Sneferu, \u00a2wtSnfrw, to which are added individual identifying names for each estate, Jacquet-Gordon, Domaines fun\u00e9raires, p. 5, and pp. 57\u201379. 54 Note, for instance, the same groups of signs found both as \u201cpotmarks\u201d and on a jar sealing from Abydos, cited in E.C.M. van den Brink, \u201cCorpus and Numerical Evaluation of the \u2018Thinite\u2019 Potmarks,\u201d in R. Friedman and B. Adams, eds., Followers of Horus, p. 265. 55 Although the combination of three signs on the ram stand is precisely paralleled neither\nin the corpus of \u201cearly inscriptions\u201d nor among \u201cpotmarks,\u201d similar signs occur as \u201cpotmarks,\u201d cf. van den Brink, \u201cCorpus and Numerical Evaluation\u2026,\u201d p. 282, Group III ( \u201carms\u201d), Group VII ( \u201carc\u201d), Group X ( \u201cdagger\u201d), and note also the occurrence of \u201dpotmarks,\u201d p. 283, group XXX, which recall the diamond pattern incised between fenestrations on the lower portion of the stand. 56 Kaiser noted that the arms may point either up or down inside the serekh, according to the location of the lines of the palace fa\u00e7ade, and reads both instances as k\u00a3: \u201cEinige Bemerkungen...,\u201d pp. 92\u201393. Kaplony, however, reads the arms as s\u221en, citing the higher frequency of arms pointing down rather than up, \u201cSechs K\u00f6nigsnamen der 1. Dynastie in neuer Deutung\u201d Orientalia Suecana 7 (1958), pp. 54\u201357. Helck, on the basis of a comparison of incised and painted inscriptions and seal impressions prefers to interpret the \u201carms\u201d as a kind of cloth with fringed ends, Untersuchungen, p. 92. Kahl, System der \u00e4gyptischen Hieroglyphenschrift, pp. 38\u201340, tabulates all examples and provides a useful overview of the debate. Note also the variability of orientation of this sign on Egyptian \u201cpotmarks\u201d of the same period and later, E.C.M. van den Brink, \u201cCorpus and Numerical Evaluation\u2026,\u201d p. 286, Group III.\n\u02c6\n376\n23 HARVEY Page 377 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:31 PM\nStephen P. Harvey, A Decorated Protodynastic Cult Stand from Abydos\nIf, however, the uppermost sign in the inscription may be read as k\u00a3, it is also possible that, together with the enclosing rectangle as \u00a2wt, the two signs form a writing of \u00a2wt-k\u00a3 or \u201cka-chapel.\u201d While \u00a2wt-k\u00a3 generally seems to denote a funerary complex,57 and is not attested as a term until the late First Dynasty, it is perhaps possible to read the rectangle and arms in this manner.58 Considering the evidence for a ka-chapel of Dynasty 6 above the findspot of the Abydos stand, this reading might imply that the stand formed part of the equipment of an earlier kachapel.59 The term \u00a2wt-k\u00a3, however, is usually followed by the name of a king or (rarely) a private person, a situation which leads us to a discussion of the final two signs of the Abydos stand. The sign directly beneath the arms pointing down is a tall arc that may be an early writing for the folded cloth, (Gardiner Sign-list S29), the uniliteral sign with the value of s. Its form, with both sides of equal length, is attested frequently in the Archaic period.60 The sign directly beneath the arc consisting of a stroke penetrating the top of an elongated triangle is difficult to read, although numerous examples of similar signs have been interpreted by Kaplony as (Gardiner sign-list T22) read as sn.61 In many instances, the sn sign is written already during the First Dynasty with the phonetic complement of .62 The resulting reading of the inscription thus might be \u00a2wt-k\u00a3 Sn (\u201cthe ka-chapel of Sen\u201d), taking Sn as a private name,63 or \u00a2wt sn-k\u00a3 (perhaps \u201cthe \u00a2wt (called) venerating the ka\u201d),64 taking the verb as an infinitive.65 Whatever the exact reading of the signs, I believe it is likely that the decoration of the ram stand simultaneously employs two forms of early\n\u00a2\ny\n\u00a2\n57\nSee now D. Franke, Das Heiligtum des Heqaib auf Elephantine, SAGA 9 (Heidelberg, 1994), pp. 118\u201327.

VIII, nos. 10 and 11, and discussion in Helck, Untersuchungen, pp. 63\u201364. Note also the intriguing occurrence of a \u201cpotmark\u201d which might be read \u00a2wt-k\u00a3, W.B.

Thus the giraffe and plant motif is an emblem, recalling both the \u201canimal + plant\u201d markings on vessels from Umm el-Qa\u2122ab Tomb U\u2013 j and similar incised markings on the Coptos Min colossi.66 In all these cases, I interpret the emblems to denote domains, and I do not believe that the animal element is likely to reflect any royal name. The attached rectangle with signs within, however, is an instance of an early hieroglyphic inscription, which seems to provide a specific name for the domain, whatever its reading. The juxtaposition of hieroglyphic signs and symbolic emblem agrees well with what we know of the development of the interaction of symbol and text in Egyptian art from Protodynastic, and indeed Dynastic, times. The final issue to be considered here is the overall meaning of the stand, taking into account its cultic context, and the apparent reference that its decoration makes to a domain or estate. Most likely, the stand was used in the ritual of a ram deity such as Khnum, which would have taken place in an early temple predating the \u201cOsiris Temple\u201d at Abydos. The graphic elements of giraffes and plants in the stand\u2019s decoration probably refer to a specific domain of this cultic complex, perhaps known as \u201cplantation of the giraffe.\u201d The signs at the back of the neck of one of the giraffes appear to name a specific endowment (\u00a2wt), whether royal or not in nature, and provide a unique hieroglyphic complement to an emblematic representation. While much that has been set forth here remains speculative, future excavation of Protodynastic cult sites will certainly provide better information on the mechanics of cult in early Egypt and the existence of cultic and administrative entities in this period of state formation.\nb\n65 It is also possible, however, that the third sign is to be taken as an early form of the later dagger *, with the value of tp (Gardiner Sign-list T8). A similar sign occurs frequently as an incised \u201cpotmark,\u201d cf. van den Brink, \u201cCorpus and Numerical Evaluation\u2026,\u201d p. 289, Group X ( ) , in combination with both the \u201carc\u201d sign, ( ) p.289, X5 and with the \u201carms,\u201d ( ), p. 289, X7. The third sign on the ram stand inscription lacks the horizontal line crossing the vertical typical of the examples cited, however, and sn thus seems a more likely reading. 66 For the Coptos colossi, see B.J. Williams, \u201cNarmer and the Coptos Colossi,\u201d JARCE 25 (1988), pp. 35\u201359; B.J. Kemp, Ancient Egypt, fig. 28, pp. 80\u201382; and G.

I have known Kelly since 1969, when he was the Co-Director of the Pennsylvania\u2013Yale Expedition at Abydos. I was Inspector of Antiquities for the Expedition then, and after that association became a very close friend of Kelly\u2019s. In 1975 he invited me to visit the Museum of Fine Arts and see the excellent collection of which he was curator. Kelly had been publishing the mastabas that Reisner discovered in the eastern and western fields by the Great Pyramid at Giza, and when I became Inspector of Giza, I was able to see him at work on his superb volumes of Giza Mastabas. In 1992, Kelly was in Egypt and came to the site to see the recent discoveries on the plateau. We had just discovered the new pyramid discussed below, and Kelly was impressed with this find, even more so because it was unexpected. While Giza has supplied several discoveries about which I could write in honor of Prof. Simpson, it is perhaps this one that might mean the most to him, and I offer my article in honor of his scholarship and friendship.1 The Antiquities Department of Giza, of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, decided in 1991 to work on the east side of the Great 2 Pyramid of Khufu. George Reisner excavated this site and recorded most of the architectural components known on the east side of Khufu\u2019s 3 pyramid. The Antiquities Department also worked in this area and, under Selim Hassan, cleared over 10 meters of sand located on the east face of the pyramid, in addition to excavating the Upper Temple of 1\nI would like to thank Mark Lehner, David P.

During this work, the satellite pyramid of Khufu was discovered. It is located about 25.5 m southeast of the southeast corner of the Khufu Pyramid and about 7 m west of the subsidiary pyramids GI\u2013b and GI\u2013c. The satellite pyramid shares the same orientation to the cardinal directions and is found at nearly the same level as the Khufu Pyramid. 1. Description of the Pyramid The ruins of the satellite pyramid cover an area approximately 24 m square (fig. 4). The remains include fine, Tura-quality limestone blocks from the pyramid\u2019s outer casing and perimeter foundation, some of which remained in situ (see below), large blocks of cruder limestone and debris that filled the core of the pyramid, and a passage and chamber cut into the bedrock. All the masonry of the pyramid core had been removed from above the substructure when we excavated the pyramid. We found the passage and chamber unroofed and open to the sky. 1.1 Superstructure What remained of the core of the superstructure as we found it was a Ushaped block of crude masonry and fill of debris that surrounded the substructure on the west, south, and east, and was open to the north. Two courses of irregular blocks remained of the core with debris fill between the blocks. The east and south sides had the most preserved foundation slabs and casing blocks of fine, Tura-quality limestone. East side On the east side, nine foundation slabs are in situ, with clear traces of the original pyramid baseline across their top surface. Five casing blocks are also in situ, but the foot of their outer sloping faces is broken away. A bottom course of squared-off core blocks is also preserved, standing above the foundation platform along much of the east side. South side We found eleven foundation slabs in situ on the south side of the pyramid with the pyramid baseline visible across their top surface. Farther in toward the core, there was a mass of debris and large irregular limestone pieces along the south side. Closer to the burial chamber, there are large limestone core blocks that were better squared and joined than those near the edge. West side Only one foundation slab remains in situ on the west side. The original pyramid baseline is clear on its upper surface. North and south of 5 The\npublication of this work with a map of the eastern field will appear shortly.\n381\n24 HAWASS Page 382 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:29 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nFig. 2.

View of the satellite pyramid substructure, looking south.\nthis slab there are broad cuttings in the natural rock which served as emplacements for missing foundation slabs. We found a mass of limestone and mortar debris that composed part of the core along the west side and, closer to the burial chamber, there are large limestone pieces that are very irregular in shape and position. North side We found the northeast corner foundation slab in its original position, but any trace of builders\u2019 lines had been worn off its upper surface. None of the original foundation slabs remains along the rest of the north side, except for one slab toward the west end, just short of the original corner. This slab revealed a very rough indication of the baseline. Along the north side there are cuttings in the rock floor that were emplacements for missing foundation slabs. Other comments On the south (back) side of the pyramid (see fig. 5), there is an inscription in red paint on the north side of a core block facing toward the burial chamber. The graffito reads: \u00a1my rsy s\u00a3, \u201cwhich is on the south (back) side\u201d (see fig. 9). We found several blocks of the outer casing that were not in their original position. One of these was a casing block of the southeast corner, probably from the second course above the foundation platform. We found many casing blocks toppled out of place along the south side.\n384\n24 HAWASS Page 385 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:29 PM\nZahi Hawass, The Discovery of the Satellite Pyramid of Khufu (GI\u2013d)\nReconstruction of the pyramid base The original baseline, or setting line, marking the foot of the lowest course of casing blocks, is preserved on five foundation slabs of the east side, and seven foundation blocks on the south side. We found no remains of the original baseline on the north side where most of the foundation slabs were missing. When the foundation slabs are missing, one can see sockets or emplacements cut into the rock floor to receive the individual slabs. However, these do not help determine the exact position of the original pyramid baseline. On the west side there is only one foundation block in situ that carried the baseline. This single block on the west side allowed us to ascertain the original base length of the pyramid, 21.75 m, by measuring to it from the preserved baseline on the east (the values here are measured graphically off the 1:50 plan). This is a bit less than 41.5 cubits. This reconstruction of the base puts the center of the pyramid .20 m north of the south (upper) edge of the burial chamber. The north\u2013south center axis of the pyramid falls about .15 m east of the best approximation of the north\u2013south center axis of the passage and chamber. Apex On the south side of the pyramid we found a large piece of fine, Turaquality limestone with three exterior sloping faces of the pyramid (fig. 13). An examination of this piece indicates that it formed a little more than the south half of the third course below the apex of the pyramid. It is 2.70 m long and .56 m thick. The exterior faces are coated with a light brown patina from their exposure when they formed part of the completed pyramid. The mean slope of the preserved faces is 52.40\u00b0. The underside of the block is flat, but the top surface was shaped as a concavity. When it completed the square of the top of this course of the pyramid, there were four triangular planes sloping toward one another to form the lines of the diagonals of the square. The four triangular planes also sloped 2.6\u00b0 to the center of the original square of the top of this course. The diagonal lines must have helped the builders control the squareness of the pyramid, to make sure the sides of the pyramid met at a point. This concavity of the top surface was intended to receive the convex underside of the block(s) forming the second course down from the top. Here, obviously, the pyramid superstructure is all casing, with no fill or core material, as it narrows to the apex. The block or blocks of the second course down from the top are missing, but later we found the actual apex stone of the satellite pyramid, a single piece of fine, Tura-quality limestone. It is the second oldest pyramidion ever found, the earliest belonging to the North Pyramid of\n385\n24 HAWASS Page 386 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:29 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\n6\nSneferu discovered by Rainer Stadelmann at Dahshur. The underside of the pyramidion was convex, with four triangular faces sloping outward 7.3\u00b0 to the center point of the base. This protruding convex base was meant to fit into the concavity of the second course from the top, just as the blocks of the second course had evidently fit into the convex top surface of third course down (of which the block of the southern half is described above). The edge along the base of the pyramidion was broken away, as was the top, but Joseph Dorner established the mean slope of the faces as 51\u00b0 45'. This evidence allows us to conclude that the mean slope of the satellite pyramid was almost exactly that of Khufu\u2019s main pyramid (51\u00b0 51'), a slope of 28:22, a seked of 5 palms two fingers, with a 7:11 proportion between height and base of the pyramid. The original height of the 7 satellite pyramid was 13.80. 1.2 Substructure The passage is closely aligned north\u2013south. The upper end of the passage begins 3.75 m from the reconstructed north base line. The width of the passage between the rock-cut walls is 1.05 m (2 cubits). It slopes downward at an angle between 25\u00b0 and 28\u00b0 (measured on the section drawings, fig. 6), for a length of 5.25 m (10 cubits) to its opening .55 m above floor level of the chamber. At the upper edges along both sides of the passage there are cuttings to receive the blocks that flanked and covered the passage. These emplacements are cut to depths ranging from 45 to 85 cm, and widths ranging from 75 cm to 1.40 m from the edges of the passage. The passage and chamber together have the T-shape normal for satellite pyramids subsequent to this newly discovered one of Khufu. The chamber is cut to a depth of 2.85 m. The long walls of the burial chamber lean inward, so that the top of the chamber is narrower than the floor line. A similar situation exists in the eleven galleries under the east side 8 of Djoser\u2019s Step Pyramid at Saqqara. The chamber is 7.92 m long (east\u2013 west). The east end of the chamber is 3.35 m wide at the floor and 2.35 m wide at the top, while the west end of the chamber is 3.40 m wide at the floor and 2.45 m wide at the top. 6 See Z. Hawass, \u201cThe Discovery of the Pyramidion of the Satellite Pyramid of Khufu,\u201d\nGs.

Sections of the satellite pyramid substructure.\nThere is a cutting in the floor of the burial chamber, one meter wide, immediately in front of the opening into the chamber of the entrance passage. The bottom of the cutting slopes to a depth of .25 m and ends at a vertical face. The cutting probably received the end of the first block with which the passage was plugged. At the west end of the chamber there are four small holes, a pair in the north and south walls respectively. The backs of the holes are round. They are about .10 m deep, and spaced, in each pair, about 1.45 m apart. Located a certain height above the floor, they appear to be sockets for wood cross-beams, perhaps for lowering or covering an object in the west end of the chamber. Since the upper part of the burial chamber is no longer extant, and no ceiling blocks remain, the original shape of the chamber remains a mystery. The inward slope of the north and south walls forms an unusual tent shape. No part of the walls is smoothed or polished. There are\n387\n24 HAWASS Page 388 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:29 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\ntraces of red mortar on the floor of the burial chamber, and traces of red on the south side. The mortar could indicate an original limestone pavement. 1.3 Restoration In order to give visitors an idea of the original appearance of this small pyramid and its place in the architectural context of the site, as well as to preserve the loose and crumbling core material, we restored parts of 9 the satellite pyramid with new masonry. Our restoration began on the east side of the satellite pyramid where much of the first casing course was in situ (see fig. 14). The blocks that we recovered allowed us to establish the inclination angle of this side as well as that of the northeast and southeast corners. The restoration team began by making a new corner block for these corners. Displaced and in situ casing blocks, as well as the in situ core block on the east side, allowed us to reestablish the heights of the courses. On the south side of the pyramid (see fig. 15), the architect first replaced a section of missing foundation slabs so as to complete the pyramid baseline which was partially preserved on this side. During the course of the excavation, large stone blocks which came from the first casing course on the south side were collected, studied and measured, and it was possible for the architect to place a few of them back into their original locations. As we re-established the southeastern corner, we based the angle of inclination of the restored upper course of casing on the blocks that we recovered, on those in situ on the eastern side, as well as on the angle of the limestone block of the third course below the pyramid apex (see above). On the north side (see fig. 16), we had to replace most of the foundation platform between the only in situ foundation slabs, one at the northeast corner and another toward the west end. We established the north pyramid baseline by taking the pyramid width as given by the preserved baseline on the east side and the single slab with baseline on the west side, and then measuring this width from the preserved baseline on the south side. On the west side (see fig. 17), we extrapolated from the baseline preserved on the single in situ foundation slab, and found the intersection with our reconstructed north baseline. We also replaced missing limestone blocks in front of the entrance to the passage and along the sides. We added a lintel across the top of the\nFig. 7.

Other Constructions on the east side of Khufu\u2019s Pyramid Scattered around Khufu\u2019s pyramid are several constructions whose functions are unknown. They include, in the order in which they are discussed below: 1. The \u201cneben-pyramid\u201d 2. GI\u2013X (the unfinished pyramid) 3. The trial passage and the narrow trench 2.1 The \u201cneben-pyramid\u201d This structure was found and named by Junker during his excavations in the GIS cemetery south of the Great Pyramid.10 It lies about 21.50 m south of the base of the pyramid, 42 m from the pyramid\u2019s southeastern corner and just outside the second enclosure wall. It is cut into the rock of the plateau and consists of a 4.30 m long descending passage that slopes to the north and ends in a small room measuring 1.5 m x 1.2 m x 0.8 m. The passage measures 0.9 m in height and 1 m in width. The top of the room is 1.3 m below the surface of the bedrock and lies under the second enclosure wall.11 10 Junker,\nG\u00eeza 10, pp. 9\u201312, fig. 6.

Possibly for topographical reasons, it was abandoned and rebuilt to the east.12 Reisner noted that before and after Khufu\u2019s time, the location of the queens\u2019 pyramids was to the south of the main pyramid, for example: the South Pyramid complex of Sneferu at Dahshur and the pyramid complexes of Khafra and Menkaura at Giza. Both he and Junker believed that the \u201cneben-pyramid\u201d was abandoned because of the proximity of the quarry to the south of the Khufu Pyramid.13 Maragioglio and Rinaldi originally suggested that it was a tomb (Reisner, type 9) which predated the Great Pyramid and was abandoned when the pyramid was built. Later they rejected this theory and proposed that the \u201cneben-pyramid\u201d was a serdab similar to the one found south of the pyramid of Khafra.14 Brinks, however, felt that the \u201cnebenpyramid\u201d was built as the substructure for a satellite or ritual pyramid for Khufu.15 Recently, we found at Giza two sections of a supply ramp located on the south side, extending to the southwest corner of the Great Pyra16 mid. Its presence suggests that the area to the south of Khufu\u2019s pyramid was free of structures during the building of the pyramid. The \u201cneben-pyramid\u201d had no apparent relationship to Khufu\u2019s pyramid. Most likely it was dug before or after Khufu\u2019s reign and has nothing to do with Khufu\u2019s burial as either a satellite or queen\u2019s pyramid. 2.2 The unfinished pyramid (GI\u2013X) Reisner found the substructure of an unfinished pyramid just east of Pyramid GIa. About 12.70 m north of this, almost on the east\u2013west axis of Khufu\u2019s pyramid is the shaft of Hetep-heres I, G 7000x. Maragioglio and Rinaldi offered another alternative explanation for GI\u2013X, namely that it represents a trial cutting designed to test the process of laying masonry onto bedrock for the entrances of the small pyramids.17 12 Junker,\nG\u00eeza 10, pp. 9\u201312, fig. 6; Reisner, Giza Necropolis 1, p. 72.\n13 Ibid. 14 Maragioglio\nand Rinaldi, L\u2019Architettura 4, pp. 174\u201376, obs. 56.

Reisner believed that this cutting was abandoned 18 when the nearby tomb of Hetep-heres I was dug. Lehner offers a different explanation for the existence of GI\u2013X. On the basis of the relationship he sees between GI\u2013X and G 7000x, he suggests that the two were features of the same subsidiary complex. According to his theory, G 7000x was dug first and GI\u2013X was started later, only to be abandoned 19 when the plan of the eastern field was changed. Fig. 12. The satellite pyramid area, looking south.\nFig. 13. Block forming the south half of the third course below the apex of the satellite pyramid.\n2.3 The trial passages and the narrow trench North of the causeway of Khufu, beside the secret tomb of Hetep-heres I are corridors cut out of the rock. These passages, called the \u201ctrial passages,\u201d lie 87.50 m from the eastern base of Khufu\u2019s pyramid and 43.50 m north of the east\u2013west axis. They are oriented north\u2013south, with carefully cut and well-squared blocks, some of which were cased with mortar. The passages have a total length of 22 m and a total vertical depth of 10 m. At the north end, an opening in the bedrock is cut in steps. It becomes a sloping passage 1.05 m wide and 1.20 m high, which continues at an angle of 260\u02da 32' for a distance of about 21 m. At a point about 11 m from the north entrance to this passage, a second passage of almost identical cross-sectional dimensions begins. This second passage ascends southward at approximately the same angle as that by which the first passage descends. At 5.80 m from its beginning, this second passage reaches the surface of the bedrock and widens into a corridor which is open to the sky. A square shaft, about 0.72 m in width was cut vertically from the surface of the bedrock to the point where the two passages meet.20 About 6 m west of the trial passages is another long corridor called the \u201cnarrow trench.\u201d This runs parallel to the other passages and is almost exactly equal in width to the vertical shaft in the trial passages. It measures 0.15 m deep at the north end and 0.43 m deep at the south end. It is 0.71 m wide and 7.35 m long.21 The function of these trial passages has been debated by scholars since their discovery by Perring and Vyse, who believed that they were 18 Reisner,\nGiza Necropolis 1, p. 70.

Petrie, who examined and mapped these passages, noted the similarity between them and the passages inside the Great Pyramid. He suggested that the trial passages functioned as a model for the interior of the Great Pyramid and noted that the trial passages had the same height and width (although shorter in length) as that of the passages in the Great 23 Pyramid. The trial passages reproduce in form the following features of the pyramid passages: the descending corridor, the ascending corridor, the northern end of the grand gallery with the lateral branches and the middle horizontal corridor.24 22 H.\nVyse, Operation carried on at the Pyramids of Giza 2 (London, 1841), pp. 63ff.

South side of the satellite pyramid, looking northeast.\nLehner lists several objections to the theory that these are model passages: flaws in the sides of the passages would not have been covered with plaster if they were not meant to be used; the lower part of the ascending passage narrows as if to provide a resting place for plugging blocks, a situation that implies a superstructure and a burial; the north opening of the descending passage is cut in steps as if to provide a place for the masonry of a superstructure; and the narrow trench appears to mark the north\u2013south axis of a pyramid. On the basis of these points, he reconstructs a pyramid over the area.25 This pyramid would have been comparable in size to GI\u2013a, b or c, and would have lain on their north\u2013 south axis. The upper temple, the causeway, and the fifth boat pit were cut into the hypothetical area of this pyramid, indicating that it was never built.26 Lehner suggested that this pyramid might have been planned as a satellite or ritual pyramid for Khufu. He thinks that it might have 25 Lehner, 26 Ibid.,\nSatellite Pyramid, pp. 50\u201351. pp. 63ff., figs. 9 and 15.\n393\n24 HAWASS Page 394 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:29 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nbeen planned to be twice as large as the eventual queen\u2019s pyramids and assumes that it was abandoned for topographical reasons.27 Lehner also suggested that the three queen\u2019s pyramids were planned at the same time as the building of this pyramid. According to his hypothesis, this pyramid was never completed, probably due to the expansion of the upper temple and the change in route of the causeway. At this point, Lehner thinks that the queen\u2019s pyramid GI\u2013a was taken over as the ritual pyramid. He chooses this pyramid because of its proximity to Khufu\u2019s upper temple and the absence of any traces of a mortuary temple associated with it.28 Lehner\u2019s theory that the trial passage was originally in the substructure of a satellite pyramid is based on the fact that many of the satellite pyramids have interiors which echo the interior of the main pyramids 29 with which they are associated. Lehner later assigned GI\u2013a to the burial of Khufu\u2019s mother, Hetep-heres I and GI\u2013b as a satellite pyramid. The most likely scenario for the subsidiary pyramids of the eastern side of the Great Pyramid seems to be the following: Khufu planned the four subsidiary pyramids on the east side, the trial passages as the substructure of the satellite pyramid and the other three pyramids as queen\u2019s pyramids. In year 5, Khufu changed his cult and appointed himself as Re, then he enlarged the upper temple to accommodate the new subjects of the wall reliefs as well as the new cult.30 The satellite pyramid was abandoned. At this time, GI\u2013a was the pyramid for the original burial of Queen Hetep-heres.31 We assumed that GI\u2013c was a satellite pyramid because this pyramid did not have a boat pit on the south side, as did GI\u2013a and b. We excavated the south side of GI\u2013c and found no evidence of boat pits. Queen Henutsen died and was buried inside GI\u2013c, but apparently the pyramid was not finished, a fact we determined based on the cross lines we found through clearance on the west side of the pyramid. The satellite pyramid was planned in the southeast corner. Its location suggests that it was built at the end of Khufu\u2019s reign in year 23, and the method of construction 27 Ibid.,\npp. 78\u201385. p. 39. 29 Ibid., p. 81; see also J\u00e9quier, Les pyramides des reines Neit et Apouit (Cairo, 1933), pp. 10\u201311. 30 Z.

The style of T-shaped burial chamber of the recently discovered satellite pyramid is typical of that of most of the satellite pyramids. Stadelmann determined that GIII\u2013a of Menkaura\u2019s subsidiary pyramid 32 was a satellite pyramid because of its T-shaped burial chamber. Khafra followed his father in building his subsidiary pyramid with a T-shaped structure, but he built it to the south on the north\u2013south axis of his 33 pyramid. He did not follow his father Khufu in the location of the pyramid. Khafra chose the southeast corner, a location that became the standard location of the satellite pyramids of Dynasties 5 and 6.\n32 R. Stadelmann, Die \u00e4gyptischen Pyramiden.

West side of the satellite pyramid, looking northeast.\n3. Location of the Old Kingdom Subsidiary Pyramid Subsidiary pyramids have been discovered in the complexes of most of the pyramids of the Old Kingdom. A debate exists over whether these represent queen\u2019s pyramids or satellite pyramids; i.e., pyramids built for the owner of the main tomb. While several of the subsidiary pyramids at Giza definitely belonged to queens, the newly discovered satellite pyramid which is the subject of this paper did not. It has been suggested that these subsidiary pyramids developed from the southern tomb of King 34 Djoser of Dynasty 3. The southern tomb of Djoser, which lies below the southern wall surrounding his complex, west of the north\u2013south axis of the Step Pyramid, is in the form of a mastaba. The burial chamber, which is not 34 H.

Other internal chambers contained the remains of a wooden box and quanti35 ties of pottery and stone vessels thought to have held milk and beer. The most significant finds, those in a long north\u2013south gallery, were three paneled niches decorated with reliefs portraying Djoser himself, 36 clearly identified by the inscriptions. These stelae, along with the small burial chamber, strongly suggest that this tomb was built for the use of Djoser, and not for a member of his family. The southern tomb of Sekhemkhet also lies on the north\u2013south axis of the main pyramid, but inside the enclosure wall. It was never finished, but was also in the form of a mastaba. Within the tomb were found the remains of a gilded wooden coffin, dated stylistically to the Old Kingdom, associated with the skeleton of a child.37 The subsidiary pyramid at Meidum is also located south of the main pyramid. There were no finds in this pyramid, except for a fragment of a stele that bears part of a falcon. Interpreted as part of a royal stele, this discovery would suggest assigning the small pyramid to the owner of the 38 main pyramid. In the Bent Pyramid complex at Dahshur, a subsidiary pyramid was built south of the main pyramid, on its north\u2013south axis. The interior of this pyramid was empty, but a stele bearing the names and titles of Sneferu next to a representation of the king seated on a throne was found outside the northern entrance.39 No trace of a subsidiary pyramid has yet been found in the northern complex at Dahshur.40 In the complex of Djedefra at Abu-Rawwash, a subsidiary pyramid 41 was started in the southwest corner of the complex. Khafra has one subsidiary pyramid, south of the main pyramid and on its central north\u2013 south axis. Inside this pyramid several items were found: ox bones, frag42 ments of wood, and a jar-sealing bearing the name of Khafra. It has 35\nJ.P.

These are, again, usually referred to as queen\u2019s pyramids, but it has been sug45 gested that either GIII\u2013a or GIII\u2013c were satellite pyramids. Userkhaf\u2019s complex contains one subsidiary pyramid, which is located to the south 46 of the west side of the main pyramid. Almost all of the remaining Fifth and Sixth Dynasty pyramid complexes contain one subsidiary pyramid, and these are always, except in the case of Niussera, whose subsidiary 47 pyramid is on the east end of the south side, east of the main pyramid 48 and south of the upper temple. The only evidence of attribution in any of these later subsidiary pyramids is from the small pyramid in the complex of Neit. A group of model vessels bearing the name of the queen 49 herself was found in the pyramid, suggesting that it as well as these later subsidiary pyramids were satellite pyramids dedicated for the use 50 of the owner of the main pyramid. The fact that many of the Sixth Dynasty queens had their own pyramids and complexes (including as in the case of Neit, subsidiary pyramids) renders the identification of any of these later subsidiary pyramids as queens\u2019 pyramids highly unlikely. Thus it seems that the satellite pyramid existed as a part of the pyramid complex of the Old Kingdom since Dynasty 3.\nb\n43 Hawass,\nFunerary Establishments, pp. 163\u201368. Reisner, Mycerinus.

Haynes\nT\nhe Department of Ancient Egyptian, Nubian, and Near Eastern Art of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, possesses a large red granite capital adorned on two faces with a woman\u2019s head with cow\u2019s ears (figs. 1\u20132). The date of this capital and the goddess represented on it have long been a matter of dispute.1 From the Early Dynastic Period through the First Intermediate Period, the image of the goddess Bat, identified by a woman\u2019s face with cow\u2019s ears, adorns a variety of objects. These include her nome standard, the king\u2019s kilt,2 and pendants of royal officials, to name only a few. In these early uses Bat, the goddess of the seventh Upper Egyptian nome, has no obvious connecting link to the goddess Hathor, the goddess of the eighth Upper Egyptian nome.3 It is not until the Bat fetish came to be incorporated into the s\u221em sistrum4 in Dynasty 11 that the images of Bat and Hathor first became associated. The unadorned sistrum had long been in use both for secular and religious purposes.5 In particular it was carried by the priestesses of Hathor when they were in her service.6 As far as our evidence shows, the 1\nBat Capital: red granite, Dynasty 19, reign of Ramesses II, ca. 1290\u20131224 b.c.; from the Temple of Bubastis, Hypostyle Hall, Gift of the Egypt Exploration Fund; MFA 89.555; max. h. 1.7 m; max. w. 1.37 m. 2 Narmer\u2019s bead apron and the girdle of King Djoser. 3 The capitals which L. Borchardt and H. Ricke, \u00c4gyptische Tempel mit Umgang, B\u00c4BA 2 (Cairo, 1938), pl. 10, show from a Princess\u2019s tomb in Sakkara near the Step Pyramid, dating to Dynasty 4, are not precursors to the Hathor column. These columns are actually missing the portion that these authors attribute to being faces. All that remains are two side pieces which look rather leaf-like, which they have called hairstyles. Actually no hairstyle compares with these two side pieces of the capital. Further, as is noted here, the hairstyle was not added to the Bat image until Dynasty 12 and the connection to Hathor was made in Dynasty 11. Overall, there is no direct link to Bat, Hathor or the sistrum in these capitals. Apparently the leafy sides of the earlier style of column reminded New Kingdom architects of their Bat-headed capitals, as they used the Old Kingdom examples as a model for those built in the Hathor shrine in Deir el Bahri, which explains the strange wooden horn, and kheker frieze, which both shrines share. 4\nH.G.

Here Hathor herself holds a Bat-faced sistrum.7 5\nHathor and the sistrum are linked at least since the reign of Tety, as evidenced by the inscription to Hathor, Lady of Dendera, which appears on a sistrum handle dating to his reign (N. de Garis Davies, \u201cAn Alabaster Sistrum Dedicated by King Teta,\u201d JEA 6 [1919], pl. 7).

Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\nWhen Bat\u2019s face, ears and horns were applied to the double faces of the sistrum her image remained relatively unchanged. The shape, function and the name of the sistrum also did not change when the face of Bat was incorporated. The sistrum was still used for accompanying singing and dancing as well as for religious ceremonies.8\n8 Klebs,\nZ\u00c4S 67, p. 61. A separate sistrum does appear called the Bat-frame sistrum which serves a musical function (see A. Blackman, Meir I [London, 1914], pl. II). According to Klebs, this is the only sistrum which is played with other musical instruments. This variety is short-lived, as it is only used in the Middle Kingdom. Another sistrum type, the BatLoop sistrum, is not known before Dynasty 18; C. Ziegler \u201cSistrum\u201d L\u00c4 5 (1984), cols. 959\u201360.\n401\n25 HAYNES Page 402 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:29 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nWhat prompted the merging of the image of Bat onto Hathor\u2019s cult objects is not certain.9 J. Bourriau suggests that it might relate to an assimilation process between the seventh and eighth Upper Egyptian nomes.10 The image of the Bat-sistrum in Dynasty 11 and early Dynasty 1211 is not the definitive development of the instrument. In the reign of Sesostris III a relief in the tomb of Ukhotep, son of Ukhotep,12 may offer evidence for the first hairstyle added to the Bat head. Here, however, the Bat image is not used on a sistrum, but as a capital on top of a slender column supporting a kiosk.13 In the reign of Amenemhat III the first examples of the \u201cHathoric\u201d or upturned hairstyle appear on Bat\u2019s head in the tomb of Neferewptah at Hawara,14 and also on a Bat image in the form of a decorative gold inlay on a wooden box from Lahun.15 This hairstyle that has been termed \u201cHathoric\u201d is seen only on the double-faced head of Bat, while the goddess Hathor is never seen wearing it herself. Furthermore, the Bat sistrum is never worshipped as Hathor.16 The function of the Bat-faced sistrum is well defined. It maintains the status of a fetish, or cult object and is not treated as, or called Hathor. The origin of this hairstyle is clearly not related to Hathor. There are numerous hypotheses concerning the derivation of this style suggesting Egypt17 or the Near East.18 9 The\nBat head is also placed on mirror handles as early as Dynasty 12, and also provides a double-faced surface to accommodate this image; see W.M.F. Petrie, Illahun, Kahun and Gurob (London, 1891), pl. 13. 10 J. Bourriau, Pharaohs and Mortals. Egyptian Art in the Middle Kingdom (Cambridge, 1988), p. 148. The cult of the goddess Bat \u201cwas in the process of becoming assimilated to that of Hathor, and by the New Kingdom Bat\u2019s attributes and epithets had all been adopted by Hathor.\u201d 11 Habachi, MDAIK 19, p. 26, fig. 8; and Blackman Meir I, pl. 10. 12 Blackman, Meir VI (London, 1953), pl. 11. 13 As the scene is partially broken the style of the hair cannot be ascertained. However, it could be short and straight as that seen in the reign of Amenemhet III, G. J\u00e9quier, Considerations (Neuchatel, 1946), fig. 85, or with the curled-up ends as in the tomb of Neferewptah at Hawara (N. Farag and Z. Iskander, The Discovery of Neferwptah [Cairo, 1971], cover). The Bat image as a capital has a history reaching back to Dynasty 4, where a relief in prince Nebemakhet\u2019s tomb at Giza shows that the Bat symbol was utilized as a capital over a catafalque at least as early Dynasty 4, well before Bat appears on sistra (S. Hassan G\u00eeza IV [Oxford,1943], p. 140, fig. 81). Also see L. Borchardt \u201cSistrums\u00e4ulen,\u201d Z\u00c4S 35 (1897), p. 168; and compare P. Newberry, Beni Hasan III (London, 1893), pl. 5, No. 81. 14 Farag and Iskander, Neferwptah, cover. 15 G. Brunton, Lahun I (London, 1920), pl. 8. This latter arrangement is unique, not only because of the hairstyle, but also because it is an extremely rare occurrence of the Bat head crowned with a sun disc and horns, the customary crown of Hathor. It is noteworthy that this box was assembled from many fragments and there is no way to ascertain if indeed these crowns belong to these images.\n402\n25 HAYNES Page 403 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:29 PM\nJoyce L. Haynes, Redating the Bat Capital in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\nThe earliest example of a woman wearing the \u201cHathoric\u201d hairstyle is in the reign of Sesostris I. It is worn by two non-royal women who flank a high official, Senweseretankh.19 Many other non-royal women such as these also wear this style throughout Dynasty 12.20 In the reign of Sesostris II this coiffure is first seen on a Queen, as Neferet\u2019s statues from Tanis are adorned with this style.21 From her reign throughout Dynasty 12 this coiffure is the one most commonly seen on royal women.22 16\nOnly in very rare instances is Bat given the name or the crowns of Hathor. One of the anomalies of the Bat image labeled Hathor is in E. Naville, The XIth Dynasty Temple at Deir El Bahari III (London, 1913), pl. 32. Note that this is a very small fragment of a stele which was reconstructed. There are few instances of Bat wearing Hathor\u2019s crown of sun disk and horn: the box of Sit-Hathor-Iunet from Lahun, now at the MMA which was entirely reconstructed, see G. Brunton Lahun I, pl. 8; two sistrophorus statues, one in the \u00c4gyptisches Museum, Leipzig, \u00c4gyptisches Museum der Karl Marx Universit\u00e4t (Leipzig, 1987), no. 65; another in the Pelizaeus-Museum, \u00c4gyptens Aufstieg zur Weltmacht (Hildesheim, 1987), no. 176; an ivory clapper in the Lowie Museum of Anthropology, Ancient Egypt (Berkeley, 1968), p. 68. The sistra are also occasionally worshipped in Dyn. 18 and 19; see D. Wildung \u201cZwei Stelen aus Hatshepsuts Fr\u00fchzeit,\u201d in Festschrift \u00c4gyptisches Museum Berlin, (Berlin, 1974), pp. 255\u201368. Note that here the sistra are not called Hathor on the stele; when named they are called \u201cthe goddess,\u201d or \u201cthe great goddess.\u201d It would make sense that the commanding architectural elements of the sistrum-capitals would be revered and worshipped by the locals. 17 W.S. Smith suggests that the hairstyle of the two seated limestone figures from Hierakonpolis (pl. I) anticipates the Hathoric wig as the two front locks are large and marked by horizontal lines (The Art and Architecture of Ancient Egypt [Middlesex, 1958], p. 27). However, a royal prototype seems unlikely. Research on hairstyles (J. Haynes, \u201cThe Development of Women\u2019s Hairstyles in Dynasty XVIII,\u201d JSSEA 8 [1977], p. 18ff.) has shown that in Dynasty 18, the women of lower social status are the first to be depicted with new hairstyles. For example, in tomb paintings and reliefs the women who were not of high social rank were the ones who wore the newest and most elaborate fashions. The wife of the deceased usually wears a more conservative style, especially early in Dynasty 18, and the mother of the deceased is almost invariably portrayed in the most traditional old-fashioned tripartite fashion. This has also been shown with the \u201cHathoric\u201d hairstyle of the Middle Kingdom, where it first is shown on the non-royal women and later on the royal. This general trend would suggest that queens as well as goddesses would be the last to be depicted with a new fashion. Therefore, a royal prototype for this hairstyle would seem highly unlikely. 18 Similar hairstyles with upturned ends were worn by several Near Eastern goddesses from the late third millennium b.c. onwards. Some scholars have argued for a Mesopotamian origin, as J. Pritchard, Palestinian Figurines in Relation to Certain Goddesses Known Through Literature (New Haven, 1943), pp. 40\u201341, and E. Brunner-Traut, Die alt\u00e4gyptischen Scherbenbilder (Wiesbaden, 1956), p. 27. 19 J. Vandier, Manuel III (Paris, 1958), p. 257, pls. 90\u201393. 20 For other non-royal women wearing this hairstyle in Dynasty 12 see S. Wenig, The Woman in Egyptian Art (New York, 1969), pl. 27b; P. Newberry, El Bersheh I (London, 1892\u20133), pl. 26; Vandier, Manuel III, pls. 76\u20136, 81\u20137, 84\u20131, 84\u20133, 84\u20135, 85\u20132, 89\u20134, 90\u20136. 21 W.S. Smith, The Art and Architecture of Ancient Egypt, pl. 67. Bourriau dates a bust of a queen with this hairstyle to the reign of Sesostris I or Sesostris II (Pharaohs and Mortals, p. 26). If it is the earlier date, it would be the earliest royal example of this hairstyle. 22 Vandier states that all queens except Berlin no. 14475 and MMA 08.202.7 wear the \u201cHathoric\u201d style in Dynasty 12 (Manuel III, p. 254).\n403\n25 HAYNES Page 404 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:29 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nThe column and capital together represent monumental stone sistra, the capital being a replica of the Bat-sistrum after the wig has been added to the sistrum. A correlation between the evolution of the sistrum and the capital can be traced.23 Edouard Naville found two sets of four Bat capitals in the hypostyle hall of the great temple of Bastet in Bubastis.24 The double-faced capital in the Museum of Fine Arts is one of the larger set of four, measuring over seven feet in height (see the site photograph in fig. 3). The other three of this group are in the Louvre, British Museum, and Egyptian Museum, Berlin.25 The face has an elaborate upcurled hairstyle that has diagonal markings indicating braided locks, and hair bands at chin level on both front tresses.26 The eyes are encircled by a thick rim with cosmetic lines extending back nearly to the ears. The ears are separated from the edge of the face by a thick ridge. Below the chin is a neckline, but no wesekh collar is indicated. Upon the head is a rectangular cornice arrangement around which is a frieze of uraei crowned by sun disks.27 On the sides of the MFA capital, uraeus serpents are carved in raised relief. Below them are smooth rectangular spaces inscribed with Osorkon II\u2019s cartouches.28 The capitals were originally painted, as Naville describes how the red color of the lips was still adhering when one of the capitals was first lifted from the ground. This group of four came in two sets of two capitals, one set representing the North and the other the South.29 The MFA capital has the northern iconography, identified by the two uraei wearing red crowns that flank the face, peering behind the ears of the goddess. On the sides of the capital, centered between the tales of the uraei stands the papyrus plant in raised relief. 23\nCompare the sistrum in G. J\u00e9quier, Considerations, fig. 85, with the capital from Deir el Bahri, in Naville, The Temple of Deir el Bahari III, pl. 68. 24 E. Naville, Bubastis (London, 1891), p. 34. It is noteworthy that these capitals can be found at temples dedicated to a variety of goddesses including Bastet, Anukis and Nekhbet. Sistrophorous statues holding the Bat head are also dedicated to a variety of deities. 25 Naville, Bubastis, p. 11. 26 The same braiding style can be seen on the sidelock of youth worn by Rameses II as a child sun god; P. Montet, \u201cLes Statues de Rams\u00e8s II \u00e0 Tanis,\u201d in M\u00e9langes Maspero I.2, MIFAO 66 (1938), pl. II. 27 See Naville, Bubastis, pl. 15, for the statue of Ramesses II crowned with a frieze of uraei. 28 To have the uraei in raised relief and a blank area beneath is a visually unappealing, and an illogical space for the Egyptian artist to leave blank. The uraeus as a decorative motif is known to expand or contract to fill any available space. Therefore, one would expect that if no cartouches were intended in the original design, then the uraei would have coiled in a large deep curve to accommodate the available space beneath them. For this concept see D. Wolfe Larkin, The Broken Lintel Doorway of Ancient Egypt and its Decoration, unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, New York University, 1994. 29\nThe other set of four Bat-sistrum capitals is smaller and simpler than the first group, with no uraei on the cornice.\n404\n25 HAYNES Page 405 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:29 PM\nJoyce L. Haynes, Redating the Bat Capital in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\nFig. 3. Site view of the Hypostyle Hall, Temple of Bubastis, taken about 1887, showing the Bat capital at the left; after E. Naville, Bubastis (London, 1891), pl. 5.\nThese capitals have been dated by Naville,30 Habachi,31 J\u00e9quier,32 Badawy,33 Smith,34 and others to Dynasty 12, and some scholars narrow down the date to the reign of Sesostris III. This dating would make these by far the earliest monumental sistrum columns. It is noteworthy that even when the naos is not included on flat, cornice-topped capitals, such as these, clearly the naos-sistrum was intended.35 Naville gave the first attribution to the Middle Kingdom, based on the proximity of an architrave and door jamb of Sesostris III, which he felt were architecturally 30 Naville,\nBubastis, pp. 11\u201313.

The iconography of the capital does not resemble that of the contemporary Dynasty 12 Bat-sistrum. For instance, as mentioned earlier, in the reign of Sesostris III, the sistrum had not yet appeared with a hairstyle. It is not until the reign of Amenemhet III that the Bat image on the sistrum is given a wig. Also, the elaborate diagonal crossed marks on the wig of the capital that denote braided or crossed tresses do not correspond to any of the numerous Dynasty 12 hairstyles. At this time, the markings are either horizontal or vertical lines, typified by those seen on Queen Nofret.38 Another iconographical feature which is not in keeping with Dynasty 12 is the image of the lily on the sides of one of the capitals of the South.39 It has a fairly unusual shape, with two drops hanging from each of the petals. This form of lily is not common before the New Kingdom.40 The frieze of uraei wearing sun disks surrounding the cornice of the Bubastis capital is also not a Middle Kingdom feature. The earliest use of large groupings of uraei in this form is in Dynasty 18. This is clearly noticeable in the reign of Amenhotep III,41 but as an architectural feature it is not prominent until the Amarna Period.42 The design of Bat\u2019s ears is another aspect of the Bubastis capitals that is out of keeping with a Dynasty 12 date. The inside of the ear on the 36 E.\nNaville, Bubastis, pp. 11\u201313.\n37 Ibid., p. 13: \u201cThis attribution may be questionable particularly as regards the Hathor and\npalm-leaf columns.\u201d 38 Considering the number of Hathoric styles that exist in Dynasty 12, it is significant that\nnone matches the Bubastis capital style. The treatment of the tresses does correlate with that on a sidelock of the child sun god on a statue dating to the reign of Ramesses II from Tanis; P. Montet, \u201cLes Statues de Rams\u00e8s II \u00e0 Tanis,\u201d in M\u00e9langes Maspero I.2, pl. II, pp. 497\u2013508. 39 L.

Kayser, \u00c4gyptisches Kunsthandwerk [Braunschweig, 1969], p. 115). It is also seen in the tomb of Ibi at Thebes dated to Psametik I (N. de Garis Davies, The Rock Tombs of Deir el Gebr\u00e2wi I [London, 1902], pl. 25 and pp. 36 , 37).

Haynes, Redating the Bat Capital in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\nearly Bat faces43 and Bat capitals44 is composed of a V-shaped design with rays of lines extending from it. However, beginning in the New Kingdom, likely the reign of Ramesses II, an additional element is added to this part of the ear. Just inside the V-shape a small globe or circle is added from which the lines emanate.45 This can be clearly seen on the Bubastis capitals, and those dating to the reigns of Rameses II,46 Achoris,47 and Ptolemy.48 In the Ramesside Period this becomes a standard addition to the design of the interior of the ear.49 This feature dates the capitals to Dynasty 19 at the earliest.50 Both stylistic and iconographic evidence points to a date no earlier than Dynasty 19 for the capitals. The capitals have more in common with the style of the sistra of this period and those of a later date than the sistra of an earlier date.51 This date range is more in keeping with the pharaohs who constructed and or rebuilt portions of this hall, namely: Rameses II, Osorkon I and Osorkon II.52 Dedication inscriptions of Osorkon I to Bastet are engraved on the bottom of some of the Bat-sistrum capitals where they abut the column, a hidden and unusual spot.53 In addition, the cartouches of Osorkon II are etched into the side of the Boston capital. 43 Sistrum\nand capitals dating from Dynasty 12 to 18.

Fast alles, was im Alten Reich den k\u00f6niglichen Jenseitsglauben gepr\u00e4gt hat, ist jetzt in 1 die private Sph\u00e4re \u00fcbernommen. Es gibt keine spezifisch k\u00f6niglichen Jenseitstexte mehr, und allein die Bauform der Pyramide, mit ihren zugeh\u00f6rigen Kultanlagen, bleibt noch bis zum Beginn des Neuen Reiches der k\u00f6niglichen Sph\u00e4re vorbehalten. Erst die 18. Dynastie gibt einerseits die Pyramidenform zum \u201cAllgemeingebrauch\u201d frei, baut aber zugleich systematisch eine neue Hierarchie auf, die bestimmte Texte, Bauformen und Abmessungen exklusiv f\u00fcr Pharao reserviert. Die Frage ist, ob diese erneuerte Hervorhebung von spezifisch k\u00f6niglichen Formen auch die Ausgrenzung einer rein k\u00f6niglichen Jenseitsregion aus dem allgemeinen Jenseits bedeutet. Aussagen dar\u00fcber sollte man vor allem in den k\u00f6niglichen Jenseitstexten erwarten, findet sich aber durch die Unterweltsb\u00fccher entt\u00e4uscht. Nur ein einziges Mal, in der sechsten Nachtstunde des Amduat, werden die \u201cK\u00f6nige von Oberund Unter\u00e4gypten\u201d erw\u00e4hnt und symbolisch dargestellt (mumiengestaltig mit Kronen); im Text wird ihnen vom Sonnengott K\u00f6nigtum und dauernde Versorgung in der Unterwelt verhei\u00dfen. An dieser Stelle, direkt neben der Vereinigung von Ba und K\u00f6rper in der tiefsten Unterwelt, geht es wohl um eine Begegnung mit den Vorfahren und Vorg\u00e4ngern des verstorbenen K\u00f6nigs, und mir scheint auch dieses Motiv daf\u00fcr zu sprechen, da\u00df es sich beim Amduat von Anfang an um einen k\u00f6niglichen Totentext handelt, nicht um eine sekund\u00e4re \u00dcbertragung auf Pharao. Bei allgemeinen Aufz\u00e4hlungen der Bewohner des Jenseits, wie sie sich z. B. im Buch von der Nacht mehrfach finden, erscheinen die K\u00f6nige nicht; sie sind entweder unter den G\u00f6ttern oder unter den AchWesen einbegriffen. 1 Klaus\nKoch, Geschichte der \u00e4gyptischen Religion (Stuttgart, 1993), S. 209ff. Zu erg\u00e4nzen w\u00e4re im diesseitigen Bereich noch die pl\u00f6tzliche Beliebtheit von Personennamen, die ihren Tr\u00e4ger als \u201cSohn\u201d oder \u201cTochter\u201d einer Gottheit bezeichnen, was im Alten Reich noch k\u00f6nigliches Privileg war.\n26 HORNUNG Page 410 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:32 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nDer Sonnengott in seiner Barke wird von den Verstorbenen durch die Unterwelt gezogen; so zeigen es Amduat und Pfortenbuch, und in den Sargkammern von Haremhab, Ramses I. und Sethos I. werden die Ziehenden durch Gew\u00e4nder und Bart deutlich als menschliche, nicht als g\u00f6ttliche Wesen gekennzeichnet. Der Wesir Useramun (TT 61) l\u00e4\u00dft sich in seiner Fassung des Amduat (4. und 8. Stunde) am Zugseil darstellen, angetan mit seiner Amtstracht. In sp\u00e4terer Zeit werden auch verschiedene Zugtiere (Schakale, Ur\u00e4en, Paviane) vor der Sonnenbarke 2 gezeigt. Einzig im Buch von der Nacht aber erscheint Pharao als Ziehender, obwohl Ramses II. in der gro\u00dfen Weihinschrift von Abydos zu seinem Vater Sethos I. sagt: \u201cdeine Arme ziehen Atum im Himmel und in der Erde (= Unterwelt), wie die Unerm\u00fcdlichen und Unverg\u00e4ng3 lichen (Sterne),\u201d ihn also als ziehend voraussetzt. Gemeinsam ist dem k\u00f6niglichen wie dem nichtk\u00f6niglichen Bereich der Wunsch des Verstorbenen, in der Barke des Sonnengottes mitzufahren und dadurch immer in seinem Gefolge zu sein. Seit Merenptah (im Kenotaph von Sethos I. in Abydos) l\u00e4\u00dft sich der K\u00f6nig gerne anbetend in der Sonnenbarke darstellen, und im Totenbuch kommt dieser Wunsch in einer ganzen Anzahl von Spr\u00fcchen zum Ausdruck, vor allem in den Spr\u00fcchen 99 bis 102, 130/131, 134 und 136; auch hier ist Useramun bahnbrechend, wenn er sich in nahezu jeder Stunde des Amduat in der Barke, meistens sogar am Steuerruder, darstellen l\u00e4\u00dft; nur in der 2. Stunde vermeidet er dies, da Isis und Nephthys hier als gef\u00e4hrliche Schlangen in der Barke erscheinen. Die Mitfahrt in der Barke bezieht den Verstorbenen in den t\u00e4glichen Sonnenlauf mit ein und erf\u00fcllt damit eine der gro\u00dfen Jenseitshoffnungen; noch direkter geschieht dies in einem Bildmotiv, das den Namen des K\u00f6nigs in die Sonnenscheibe einschreibt und damit bildhaft das v\u00f6llige Aufgehen des K\u00f6nigs in der Sonne zum Ausdruck bringt, wie es die alte Umschreibung f\u00fcr den Tod eines Pharao in aller K\u00fcrze formuliert: \u201cer wurde zum Himmel entr\u00fcckt und vereinigte sich mit der Sonne.\u201d In der Sonnenlitanei vom Anfang der 18. Dynastie begegnet die deutliche Gleichsetzung \u201cIch bin du, und du bist ich, dein Ba ist mein 4 Ba, dein Lauf ist mein Lauf durch die Unterwelt.\u201d L.

Aber anders als Useramun und die Privatleute im Totenbuch f\u00e4hrt hier der K\u00f6nig als Re dahin! In der Sargkammer von Ramses III. findet sich eine dritte, etwas anders gestaltete Fassung; dort umschlie\u00dft ein doppelter Uroboros den Geburtsnamen des K\u00f6nigs (mit dem Element mes \u201cgeboren\u201d genau in der Mitte!), der ja auch die Sonnenscheibe enth\u00e4lt, mit einer weiteren 7 Sonnenscheibe und den zw\u00f6lf Stundeng\u00f6ttinnen. Hier wird Pharao nicht nur in das Wesen des Sonnengottes aufgenommen, sondern dazu in den gr\u00f6\u00dften denkbaren Zeit-Horizont eingeschlossen, den die Dualit\u00e4t von Neheh und Djet verk\u00f6rpert. Seine Jahre, \u201cMillionen\u201d und \u201cHunderttausende,\u201d sind die Jahre des Re, seine Lebenszeit die der Sonne, wie es immer wieder in den W\u00fcnschen der G\u00f6tter f\u00fcr Pharao formuliert ist. Die gleiche Idee wird, \u201cdemokratisiert\u201d und in anderer Form, auf S\u00e4rgen der 21. Dynastie gestaltet, wenn man direkt hinter dem Kopf des Toten, auf der Innenseite des Kopfendes, eine SonnenlaufSzene anbringt und ihn so unmittelbar in den Lauf des Gestirns hineinnimmt. Bei Sethos I. geschah das bereits auf seinem Alabastersarg, der an dieser Stelle das Schlu\u00dfbild des Pfortenbuches aufweist. Eine weitere Gemeinsamkeit beider Medien ist die Gliederung des Jenseits durch Tore. Diese werden im Amduat am Ende jeder Nachtstunde bereits vorausgesetzt, aber nicht dargestellt, w\u00e4hrend sie im Pfortenbuch sichtbar und gut bewacht erscheinen. Im Totenbuch sind die Spr\u00fcche 144 bis 147 den Jenseitstoren und ihren W\u00e4chtern gewidmet, und Nefertari n\u00e4hert sich durch eine Auswahl aus diesen Spr\u00fcchen soweit als m\u00f6glich der Dekoration der k\u00f6niglichen Grabkammer mit dem Pfortenbuch an, das selbst sie nicht verwenden darf. Dabei unterscheiden sich Unterweltsb\u00fccher (mit zw\u00f6lf) und Totenbuch (mit sieben oder 21) in der Zahl der Pforten, die sichtlich von sekund\u00e4rer Bedeutung ist. Dagegen besteht ein wesentlicher Unterschied in der Situation des Verstorbenen vor den Toren. Im Totenbuch begehrt er als \u201cOsiris NN\u201d Einla\u00df, befindet sich \u201cim Gefolge des Stiers des Westens\u201d und betet in den Vignetten die Torw\u00e4chter an.

Der Tote legitimiert sich durch Kenntnis der Namen und durch Reinheit, dazu tritt er als Horus und getreuer Sohn des Osiris auf, denn die Tore sollen hier in erster Linie Osiris sch\u00fctzen. Ganz anders im k\u00f6niglichen Pfortenbuch! Dort bedarf es nur einer kurzen Aufforderung durch Sia, um Tor nach Tor f\u00fcr den Sonnengott und seine Durchfahrt zu \u00f6ffnen, und die Meinung ist nat\u00fcrlich, da\u00df mit ihm auch der tote K\u00f6nig jedes Tor durchzieht. Im Tor der f\u00fcnften Stunde findet das Totengericht statt, wobei der thronende Osiris schon durch die ungew\u00f6hnliche Doppelkrone, die er dort tr\u00e4gt, auf seine Identit\u00e4t mit dem verstorbenen K\u00f6nig hinweist. Das letzte Tor ist durch Isis und Nephthys als Ur\u00e4us-Schlangen noch zus\u00e4tzlich gesch\u00fctzt, um den Sonnenaufgang keinen Gefahren auszusetzen. Eines der vordringlichen Themen der Jenseitshoffnung ist die materielle Versorgung, die der K\u00f6nig ebenso erhofft wie alle anderen Menschen. Beliebte Garantin daf\u00fcr ist die Baumg\u00f6ttin, die nur ein einziges Mal im K\u00f6nigsgrab dargestellt wird (bei Thutmosis III.), w\u00e4hrend sie in den Beamtengr\u00e4bern zu den beliebtesten Motiven geh\u00f6rt und auch in Totenbuch-Papyri erscheint. Signifikant ist wohl, da\u00df Ramses III. in Medinet Habu Vignetten aus dem Totenbuch verwendet, die mit der jenseitigen Ern\u00e4hrung zu tun haben, dabei neben dem \u201cBinsengefilde\u201d von Spruch 110 die sieben K\u00fche und ihren Stier, \u201cdie den Verkl\u00e4rten Brot und Bier geben und die Westlichen speisen\u201d (Totenbuch 148). Ein nahrungspendendes Kuhbild, die \u201cOpferherrin, die \u00fcber die Dat gebietet,\u201d zeigt auch das Amduat im mittleren Register der neunten Stunde (Nr. 669), und auf dem Sarkophag von Nektanebos II. im British Museum hat diese Szene einen Zusatz, der dem K\u00f6nig Brot und Bier verhei\u00dft. Bei der Nachtfahrt der Sonne vollzieht sich in den Unterweltsb\u00fcchern am tiefsten Punkt, in der sechsten Nachtstunde, die Vereinigung des Sonnen-Ba mit seinem K\u00f6rper, der zugleich Osiris ist; beide sind \u00fcberdies Ba und K\u00f6rper des verstorbenen Pharao. In der nichtk\u00f6niglichen Sph\u00e4re entspricht diesem Motiv die Vereinigung von Ba und K\u00f6rper in Spruch 89 des Totenbuches, der besondere Beliebtheit auf den S\u00e4rgen der Sp\u00e4tzeit erlangt, aber bereits auf dem Alabastersarg Sethos\u2019 I. verwendet ist. Die \u00e4lteste Darstellung des \u201cvereinigten\u201d Re/Osiris, offenbar f\u00fcr das Grab der Nefertari geschaffen und in einigen anderen Gr\u00e4bern der 19. Dynastie verwendet, illustriert nicht die k\u00f6nigliche Sonnenlitanei, sondern den Anfang des Totenbuch-Spruches 180, der aus der Sonnenlitanei adaptiert wurde.\n412\n26 HORNUNG Page 413 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:32 PM\nErik Hornung, Zum k\u00f6niglichen Jenseits\nBannung von Gefahren und \u00dcberwindung von Feinden begegnen in vielen Spr\u00fcchen des Totenbuches, wobei die Spr\u00fcche 7, 39 und 108 speziell der \u00dcberwindung des Erzfeindes Apophis dienen, der in den Unterweltsb\u00fcchern immer wieder von der Sonnenbarke abgewehrt wird. Neben ihm begegnen andere feindliche oder gef\u00e4hrliche Schlangen in den Unterweltsb\u00fcchern wie im Totenbuch, also wiederum in beiden Bereichen. Bisher haben sich das k\u00f6nigliche und das nichtk\u00f6nigliche Jenseits nur in Nuancen unterschieden. Der einzig signifikante Unterschied liegt in der Darstellung von Strafen. Zwar zeigt das Totenbuch den omin\u00f6sen \u201cFeuersee\u201d in der Vignette zu Spruch 126 und nach der Amarnazeit das drohende Untier \u201cTotenfresser\u201d beim Totengericht, aber die Bestrafung von \u201cFeinden\u201d wird in keiner Vignette direkt dargestellt; \u00fcberdies geh\u00f6rt die einzige Erw\u00e4hnung der \u201cVernichtungsst\u00e4tte\u201d (\u00a2tmyt) im Totenbuch (127, Vers 26) eigentlich zur k\u00f6niglichen Sonnenlitanei. Dagegen bilden die H\u00f6llenbilder der 8 Bestrafung, die gerne in der \u201cVernichtungsst\u00e4tte\u201d lokalisiert sind, seit dem Amduat einen festen Bestand der k\u00f6niglichen Unterweltsb\u00fccher, ohne da\u00df man daraus folgern darf, es g\u00e4be Bestrafung nur im k\u00f6niglichen Jenseits. Vielmehr gilt wohl, da\u00df nur Pharao dieser destruktiven Realit\u00e4t des B\u00f6sen begegnen kann, die das Totenbuch der Privatleute sich scheut, im Bilde zu beschw\u00f6ren und damit zur Realit\u00e4t zu erheben. Bei aller detaillierten Beschreibung des Jenseits in den Unterweltsb\u00fcchern bleibt der Ort Pharaos eigenartig unbestimmt und vage. Es geht offensichtlich nicht darum, wo Pharao sich befindet, sondern um seinen status. Er ist \u201cvermischt\u201d mit Sternen und Mond (Ramses II. 9 \u00fcber Sethos I.) und von den G\u00f6ttern \u201cnicht zu unterscheiden\u201d (Tut10 anchamun); sonnenhaft leuchtet sein Ba \u201cunter denen mit dunklem 11 Gesicht\u201d (Ramses II.) und \u201cer wird Verwandlungen machen wie Re\u201d\n8\nDazu Erik Hornung, \u201cSchwarze L\u00f6cher von innen betrachtet: Die alt\u00e4gyptische H\u00f6lle,\u201d in: Erik Hornung und Tilo Schabert, Hrsg., Strukturen des Chaos, Eranos, Neue Folge 2 (M\u00fcnchen, 1994), S. 227\u201362; englische Fassung, \u00fcbersetzt von David Warburton: \u201cBlack Holes Viewed from Within: Hell in Ancient Egyptian Thought,\u201d Diogenes No. 165 (1994), S. 133\u201356. 9 KRI\nII, 333, 11f.\n10 Alexandre Piankoff, Les chapelles de Tout-Ankh-Amon\n(Cairo, 1951), pl.

Es scheint, da\u00df er die Unterwelt nur durchzieht, ohne dort zu verweilen, auch darin dem Sonnengott gleich. Die Existenz von k\u00f6niglichen wie von nichtk\u00f6niglichen Jenseitsbeschreibungen erlaubt es, f\u00fcr das Neue Reich die Frage nach einem spezifisch k\u00f6niglichen Jenseits zu stellen. Dabei zeigt es sich, da\u00df die Hauptmotive des Jenseitsbildes in beiden Bereichen praktisch gleich sind, denn das erhoffte selige Fortleben gilt im Prinzip f\u00fcr alle Menschen\u2014sogar, wie das Pfortenbuch in der 30. Szene vor Augen f\u00fchrt, f\u00fcr die Fremdv\u00f6lker, die dort \u00e4gyptischen Schutzgottheiten unterstellt werden und jenseitige \u201cLebenszeit\u201d zugeteilt erhalten. Pharao betritt bei seinem Tod das gleiche Jenseits wie alle Wesen, aber sein status ist ein anderer. Wie er auf Erden die Rolle des Sonnengottes spielt, so handelt er auch im Jenseits als Re. Und was ihn von allen anderen Toten unterscheidet, ist die Aus\u00fcbung von Herrschaft. Nur er erh\u00e4lt von den G\u00f6ttern die Insignien von Szepter und Flagellum, erh\u00e4lt den \u201cThron seines Vaters Geb\u201d und das K\u00f6nigtum des Horus, w\u00e4hrend selbst K\u00f6nigin Nefertari sich damit begn\u00fcgen mu\u00df, einen \u201cPlatz\u201d im Totenreich zu erhalten, in welchen sicher auch ihre soziale Stellung einbegriffen ist. Zu diesem erh\u00f6hten status geh\u00f6rt weiter, da\u00df es allein dem K\u00f6nig verg\u00f6nnt ist, eine endlose Kette von Sedfesten zu feiern, die sich \u00fcber den Tod hinaus in das Jenseits fortsetzt oder sogar erst dort ihren Anfang nimmt. Sein Fortleben vollzieht sich in anderen, kosmischen Dimensionen. Wohl deshalb h\u00e4lt man auch im Neuen Reich daran fest, nur in k\u00f6niglichen Grabbauten (mit Einschlu\u00df der K\u00f6nigin) die Decken als gestirnten Himmel auszugestalten, w\u00e4hrend sich die Beamten mit Ornamenten begn\u00fcgen m\u00fcssen F\u00fcr den Beamten, der seit jeher nach K\u00f6nigsn\u00e4he strebt, bedeutet der Jenseitsweg Pharaos die Hoffnung auf eine zyklische Wiederbegegnung im Reich der Toten. Mit dem n\u00e4chtlichen Sonnengott darf er immer aufs neue seinen verstorbenen Herrscher wieder begr\u00fc\u00dfen und ihm wie zu Lebzeiten zurufen \u201cDu bist Re.\u201d Als \u201cOsiris NN\u201d begegnet er in der Nachtsonne, die ihn zu neuem Leben weckt, auch seinem K\u00f6nig wieder. Beide umschlie\u00dft die gleiche Unterwelt, aber wie im Anfang der \u00e4gyptischen Geschichte scheint Pharao keine feste Residenz zu haben, sondern durchzieht unerm\u00fcdlich seinen jenseitigen Herrschaftsbereich.\nb\n12\nAlexandre Piankoff und Nina Rambova, The Tomb of Ramesses VI (New York, 1954), pl. 132, Zusatz zur Szene D 13 im Buch von der Erde.

James\nA\nuseful contribution to the sparse history of Howard Carter, during the years just before and after he was engaged by the Earl of Carnarvon as his \u201clearned man,\u201d is made by a group of his letters preserved in the archives of the Massachusetts Historical Society, and recently published in part in the Miscellany of the Society.1 The correspondence extends from October 1908 to June 1914, addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Kingsmill Marrs of Wayland, Massachusetts, a couple who devoted their time to travel, the collection of books, and, in the case of Mrs. Marrs most notably, European prints. Mr. Marrs died in Florence in 1912, and his widow survived him until 1926. The letters, seemingly part only of a larger exchange over several years, now form part of the Grenville Norcross Autograph Collection in the Massachusetts Historical Society (M.H.S.). Norcross was the brother of Mrs. Marrs. It is clear from the earliest letters that the Marrs had got to know Howard Carter during a winter visit to Egypt, probably made in the early months of 1908. It is reasonable to assume that they, with a friend named Mr. Barker, made use of Carter as a professional guide to the monuments of Thebes, and were among those who purchased watercolors by him, some from stock, and some commissioned for later execution and dispatch to the U.S.A. The six Marrs watercolors in fact represent the largest identifiable group of paintings purchased from Carter by a single client (apart from archaeological commissions) during the years before his association with Lord Carnarvon.2\n1\nM.H.S.

It came as some surprise to me to find that in the published catalogue of the Worcester paintings, referred to below, the compiler of the entries for the Carter items credits myself with having provided the Egyptological identifications for five of the paintings. I retain no memory of having done so, but it would have taken place in the early 1970s, many years before I began an active interest in Howard Carter. I am gratified that in only one case have I been able to improve on my first identifications. 3 See James, Howard Carter (London, 1992), p. 157. 4 An almost full-length figure of Queen Nefertari from a scene on the east wall of the corridor descending to the sarcophagus chamber in her tomb, in which she is shown offering nw-pots to Hathor, Selkis and Maat.

He was the author of Handlist of the Birds of Egypt (Cairo, 1919), and his papers formed the basis of R. Meinertzhagen, Nicholl\u2019s Birds of Egypt, 2 vols. (London, 1930). A memoir of Nicholl by Meinertzhagen is included in vol. I, pp. v\u2013x. Carter\u2019s interest in birds is well attested, as also are his visits to the Giza Zoo, where he observed and drew birds. Nicholl would have been an obvious friend and a welcome guest in Thebes, although he is not mentioned elsewhere in Carter\u2019s papers, as far as I have been able to check.\n417\n27 JAMES Page 418 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:33 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nFig. 2.

Petrie et al., Qurneh (London, 1909); the later part of the season was more successful than the earlier. 11 The first recorded precise mention of the beginning of Carter\u2019s association with the Earl of Carnarvon, although the date\u2014early 1909\u2014can be deduced from other evidence, see T.G.H. James, Howard Carter. The Path to Tutankhamun (London, 1992), p. 139ff. On the matter of the \u201cenormous fee,\u201d it may be noted that in 1911 Carnarvon told P.E. Newberry \u201cYou must remember I pay Carter \u00a3200 per mensem,\u201d loc. cit., p. 163. Such a rate of pay, if it had been the same in 1909, would indeed have been considered \u201cenormous.\u201d 12 Carter\u2019s wish to discover this tomb went back to the years when he was Chief Inspector for Upper Egypt. He interested Lord Amherst in the project, but made little progress before being moved to the Inspectorate of Lower Egypt in late 1904; see James, op. cit., p. 93ff. It was not until early 1914 that he was able seriously to return to the search, the results then being published as \u201cReport on the tomb of Zeser-ka-ra Amenhotep I, discovered by the Earl of Carnarvon in 1914,\u201d JEA 3 (1917), pp. 147\u201354. This article is referred to in Letter 4 below. 13 See note 7 to Letter 1 above. 14 Undoubtedly Walter Frederick Roofe Tyndale (1856\u20131943), RI (Royal Institute of Painters in Watercolours, elected 1912), an artist, principally in watercolor, who wrote and illustrated a number of topographical-travel works, including Below the Cataracts (London and Philadelphia, 1907). L\u2019Egypte d\u2019hier et d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui (Paris, 1910), Japan and the Japanese (London, 1910), and with Harriet Taylor, Japanese Gardens (1912). The first of these volumes, which is probably the one referred to by Carter, contains reproductions of sixty of Tyndale\u2019s paintings in color, including scenes of Cairo street life, views of standard monuments and of figure subjects from reliefs and paintings.\n420\n27 JAMES Page 421 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:33 PM\nT.G.H. James, Howard Carter and Mrs. Kingsmill Marrs\nA gap of over two years separates Letters 2 and 3. There may have been no exchange between Carter and the Marrs before he was sent the cuttings mentioned below. Letter 3 Swaffham \u2013 Norfolk June 23rd 1911 My dear Mrs. Marrs It was so nice to hear once again from you & that Mr Marrs\u2019 health is improving. I have often wondered how you all have been & only wished you were in Egypt last winter. The cuttings you enclosed are most interesting & the first I had heard of the new theory regarding the poor old Sphinx.15 The dating & still more the naming of an unnamed monument such as the Sphinx must always be a matter of vague conjecture\u2014a possible reason why Herodotus ignored it altogether. And the so called \u201cRiddle of the Sphinx\u201d seems as great an invention of modern times as the Sphinx itself invented by the ancients. Reisner\u2019s theory is very possibly a correct one, though one cannot help but think that the evidence for so emphatic a statement is small. Certainly it has great probabilities of being somewhere near the mark. For on that plateau we have nothing that is not purely mortuary & the mass of the stuff there pertaining to the Old Kingdom. Mr. Higgins contentions, who ever the man may be for I have not heard of him before & for the moment shall call him \u201cJuggins\u201d,16 is as celestial as his starry hypothesis. However true his theory of the origin of the Sphinx formation may be, it gives no reason why any one king should not adopt the form when wishing to represent himself. The hundred and one monuments we have from the earliest to the very latest period of kings of Egypt representing themselves as human headed lions crushing their enemies\u2014a common symbol of power used among the symbolical sculptures of the ancient Egyptians\u2014is a fact Mr. Higgins seems either not to know or to have forgotten. There can I think be little doubt that the Sphinx did represent some reigning monarch & most probably of the Old Kingdom. The topographical position is strongly in favour with Reisner\u2019s supposition but I think him most wrong in making his statement so emphatic.17 I am so glad that you liked Miss Rathbone. Your statement was correct, but you see her height enabled her to look over my head.\n15\nThe newspaper debate on the Sphinx was apparently brought to a conclusion\u2014as, no doubt, he would himself have claimed by Dr. George Reisner in an article \u201cSolving the Riddle of the Sphinx,\u201d Cosmopolitan Magazine 53 (New York, 1912), pp. 4\u201313. I have not seen the various contributions to this controversy. 16 A\nlate Victorian-Edwardian term for a simpleton, usually written without a capital J. as in \u201cYah! Wot a old juggins he is!,\u201d Punch (July 17, 1818). 17 An interesting comment by Carter. Reisner was much given to making dogmatic judgments, especially in his later years\u2014well attested by his assistants and colleagues, Dows Dunham and William S. Smith.\n421\n27 JAMES Page 422 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:33 PM\nStudies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson\nFig. 4.

Yes we were certainly lucky & found a very large tomb of the Middle Empire, which had been reused as a hiddingsic place for later burials ranging between the Hyksos Period and the early Eighteenth Dynasty.18 It was full of most interesting stuff having 64 separate & untouched burials in it, the cache being made by some pious officials of the necropolis for their safe keeping from the thieving workmen who disturbed them in making some alteration or when clearing the ground in constructing some new monuments. I am now occupied in getting out a publication of the three seasons results which will be fully illustrated & I hope in the course of the year to be able to send you a copy which will better describe to you the whole finds than I shall be able to do here.19 I think our pearls were a harp of the Hyksos time and a delightful little portrait figure of a boy in electrum of a period of Amenhetep Ist.20 My chateau is built & awaiting you,21 and I am now home for a holiday of three months after a strenuous two years of painting, building and excavating. Please give my best wishes to all & with every kind regards to yourself Yours most sincerely Howard Carter The Constitutional Club Northumberland Avenue will find me \u2019till Sept 15. Then the same old Luxor. H.C.\nThe fourth letter, written not long before the outbreak of the Great War, is written on black-edged writing paper. It is not clear whom Carter may have been mourning in this way; not Mr. Marrs, surely, who had died in 1912; possibly one of his brothers, the dates of death of some of whom have not yet been established by the genealogists of the Carter family. The only matter of Egyptological interest touched on in this 18 Tomb 37 in the Carnarvon-Carter excavations, described in their Five Years\u2019 Explorations at Thebes (London, 1912), p. 64ff. 19 The volume, as published, covered not only the three years of Carter\u2019s work for Carnarvon (1909\u20131911), but also the results of the two preceding years when Carnarvon worked alone under the general supervision of Arthur Weigall, the Upper Egyptian Chief Inspector. The volume, subtitled A Record of work done 1907\u20131911, contains no specific mention of the change in direction of the Carnarvon excavations, which has led generally to the misconception that Carter began working for Carnarvon in 1907, and not in 1909 as the Marrs correspondence makes clear. 20 The harp is described by Carter, op. cit., p. 82f., and illustrated on pl. LXXI, bottom. It is now in the Cairo Museum, see H. Hickmann, Instruments de musique (Cairo, 1949), p. 168, pl. CVII (JdE no. 43161, Catalogue G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, no. 69424). The \u201celectrum\u201d statuette of Amenemheb, described and illustrated by Carter, op. cit., p. 75, frontispiece and pl. LXVII, is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, no. 26.7.1413. It is not of electrum but of copper, with the lotus bud in the left hand of silver, cf. W.C. Hayes, Scepter of Egypt II (New York, 1959), p. 61; N. Reeves and J.H. Taylor, Howard Carter before Tutankhamun (London, 1992), p. 99. 21 Castle Carter II on the hill Elwat el-Diban was completed and occupied by Howard Carter in January\u2013February 1911; for contemporary comments and opinions on it, see James, Howard Carter (London, 1992), p. 159.\n424\n27 JAMES Page 425 Thursday, July 22, 2004 1:33 PM\nT.G.H.

Letter 4 June 12. 1914 Turf Club Cairo Dear Mrs. Kingsmill Marrs Thank you so much for your two very kind letters. I have been long in answering them, but I have been moving about Egypt, letters have followed me & I have had really little chance of answering them. Your kind invite to stop at Florence was most inviting but I must get straight back to England\u2014I hope by next week\u2019s mail. It has been abnormally hot this May & June, in fact the hottest experienced for many years, which naturally makes one long to get away from it. I hope soon to have another publication out of our latter work including the discovery of the royal tomb of Amenhetep I. The latter discovery has been of great interest owing to the ancient records of the King\u2019s tomb in legal papyrus recording the ancient robberies. In years we have tried to find its where abouts from these early statements\u2014but not until this last autumn were we successful. With every kind wish & regards to both Mr. Barker & yourself Yours most sincerely Howard Carter\nMrs. Kingsmill Marrs (Laura Norcross, 1845\u20131926) was undoubtedly one of the most discriminating of those who purchased watercolors from Howard Carter. Before her visit to Egypt with her husband in 1908\u2014 possibly a second visit\u2014she had built up over many years an important collection of European prints, initially under the guidance of Sylvester Rosa Koehler, the first Curator of Prints in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Koehler had died in 1899, but Mrs. Marrs continued collecting, and her print collection was ultimately bequeathed to the Worcester Art Museum at her death.22 Her switch of allegiance from Boston to Worcester had started not long after Koehler\u2019s death, and over the years she and her husband gave numerous items from their collections to Worcester. The six Howard Carter watercolors were donated in 1925, the year before her death. They had undoubtedly been well regarded by\n22 See Timothy A. Riggs, \u201cMr. Koehler and Mrs. Marrs: the formation of the Mrs. Kingsmill Marrs Collection,\u201d Journal of the Worcester Art Museum I (1977\u201378), pp. 3\u201313.

The subjects are mostly taken directly from Theban monuments, one being a view, the others careful, but not slavish, copies of figures from tombs and temples. They represent a good collection of Howard Carter\u2019s work in this genre. All are watercolors on prepared board, apart from the view of Medinet Habu, which is watercolor on paper. In the list below they are described in the order of museum numbering, rather than chronologically.23 1925.140 (fig. 2). Heads of two men at a banquet (38.2 cm x 49.3 cm); see N. de G.

Not fully identified in the Worcester catalogue. 1925.142 (fig. 4). Queen Ahmose, wife of Tuthmosis I and mother of Hatshepsut (57.8 cm x 40.5 cm); it seems to be an invention of Carter\u2019s, based on various representations of the queen in the temple of Deir el-Bahri, e.g., E. Naville, The Temple of Deir el Bahari II (London, 1897), pl. XLIX; V (London, 1906), pl. CXLVII. Dated 1908, but not signed with Carter\u2019s usual signature; signed instead in careful capitals. The head of the queen, taken from the first of the two references above was a favorite subject of Carter\u2019s. His original painting, now in the offices of the Egypt Exploration Society, was reproduced in op. cit., III (London, 1898), pl. LXVII. He repeated it for clients on many occasions in later years. 1925.143 (fig. 5). Daughter of Menna, from a boating scene (56.2 cm x 39.5 cm). This well known detail from Theban Tomb no. 69 is much reproduced, e.g., in color, in A. Mekhitarian, Egyptian Painting (Geneva, Paris, New York, 1954), p. 93.
