They all have in common metabolic dysregulation and imbalanced energy conversion. However, in the last decades research in life sciences and medicine delivered many new tools to elucidate biochemical basics and clinical manifestations of metabolic disorders. For social aspects, it must be evaluated how far these new technologies can be applied for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes besides conservative treatment like gastric surgery in case of adipositas for instance.\nThe symposium focuses on research into the causes and treatment strategies of metabolic diseases and their outstanding social relevance. Due to its high impact on public health, experts from different fields will present recent data and developments regarding dysregulated metabolism and will discuss together the influence of lifestyle-related diseases on society.\nThe symposium is organized by Prof. Dr. Hannelore Daniel, Prof. Dr. Christian Wolfrum und Prof. Dr. Alexander Pfeifer, who contribute to the program as well.\nThe event is aimed at a professionally interested public and is free of charge. Registration is required.\n[To the registration](https://www.umfrageonline.com/c/3btkkvnx) (umfrageonline.com)\nDr. Stephan Altmann\nInstitute for Pharmacology and
