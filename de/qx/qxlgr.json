( Mine have refused)\nMost of their seniors group have been given the A^JAB last week.\nMost are feeling unwell, sore muscles and headaches and flu like symptoms.\nOne gentlemen had a reaction.\nHe had skin graft on his leg from removing melanoma cancer. This was about 8 months ago. The skin graft hasn't healed so well and it need dressing about once a week, it was not bleeding but more like seeping wound healing slowly.\nYesterday he visited my sister and while he was sitting in chair, his leg started bleeding a lot. There was a pool of blood under his leg and also his shoe was full of blood, the pool of blood was a little bit bigger than a size of a magazine. He did not realise what was happening.\nMy sister told him he should head to the hospital. Which he did and was quite alarmed.\nAs she cleaned up the blood from the floor with gloves and paper towel she said it was really really strange consistency. There was another person in the room and they also commented on the look of the blood on the floor.\nIt was thick and chunky it wasn't like normal blood should be like. It didn't drip in drops but more like clumped together. She mentioned like crystallized honey?\nUnfortunately my sister was so upset by the situation she didn't take a photo because the gentleman was now becoming a little worried about all the blood on the floor and in his shoe..\nShe asked him if he had the Jab and he said yes a week ago. He said he wanted to get J^AB because the doctors told him he cant travel interstate or overseas if he didnt..\nUpdate from him today 6th june 21 he went to hospital and the bandaged is leg up, gave him some medication.\nHe is really worried about blood clots and very scared of what might happen to him... He doesnt know what to do. He is scared but in his 80's so doesnt say anything !!! He hopes he doesnt have a stroke or heart attack.\nIts so so sad that our elderly are being told they need the J AB to travel or scare mongering into taking this horrible Poison..\nThey being taken advantage of.\nIf they only knew what reactions they might get..\nThis Madness has to stop... Please stop its awful.\n|07.06.2021||NSW\n|\nA woman in New South Wales has died of a rare blood clotting condition after receiving the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, the Therapeutic Goods Administration has reported.\nThe TGA said since last week, four reports of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) had been confirmed as \"likely\" to be linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nA 52-year-old woman was one of these cases and the TGA reported she had suffered a severe form of TTS in the form of a blood clot in her brain, also known as a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, before her death.\n|07.06.2021||Australia\n|\nTGA weekly report just launched ... 30 Aussies are dying each week from the Covid Vaccine.\nThis takes the total Australian reports of cases assessed as TTS following the AstraZeneca vaccine to 48, with 35 confirmed cases and 13 probable cases. Based on the most recent information available to us:\n31 have been discharged from hospital and are recovering, with some receiving ongoing outpatient medical care\n15 patients remain in hospital, including one who remains critically ill in intensive care\ntwo people have died in hospital.\n------reporting physicians file a report of death following vaccination for investigating by the panel. They've got 27,000 reports and are so behind they'd need another four years to complete these investigations. In ANY OTHER post market surveillance the assumption is that unexpected death within 12-24 hours of a new investigational drug will be considered as a result of the new treatment until proved otherwise.\n|01.06.2021||Melbourne, Victoria\n|\nHas anyone else's vaccination data (second shot) been LOST by the system?\nAnd there is no record of it anywhere even if it has been almost a week?\nOr is it just me?\nThey can't even get the administration right these clowns.\n|01.06.2021||Australia\n|\nFilm maker Peter Spann passed away after taking AstraZenica jab.\nHe proudly announced on social media on May 25th that he had his first jab.\nIt has been confirmed on social media that popular Australian filmmaker, businessman, writer, investor and speaking coach, Peter Spann has sadly passed away. He was reported to have died on May 31 2021.\nHis cause of death or what led to his sad demise has not been made known to the public.\nReacting to his death Chairman and CEO of ActionCoach, Brad Sugars made a lengthy post on his official Facebook page about Peter, describing him as one the funniest persons he has ever met.\n|01.06.2021||Australia\n|\nIn the week of 24-30 May 2021 we received 1825 adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) reports for COVID-19 vaccines.\nEight additional cases of blood clots with low blood platelets have been assessed as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) likely to be linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. This brings the total number of confirmed and probable TTS cases in Australia to 41.\n- 23 have been discharged from hospital and are recovering\n- four have left hospital but require outpatient medical care\n- 13 patients remain in hospital\n- one patient died in hospital.\nIn total, 42,402 AEFI reports have been received.\n|01.06.2021||Australia\n|\nHey guys, I hope you\u2019re all well!\nLong story short, my partner is being given no option but to take the vaccine in her uni studies.\nI remember viewing a legal act last year stating that those who choose not to receive any sort of vaccine, have the right to do so without any repercussions such as (being stood down, loss of opportunity etc)\nI had saved the act but can\u2019t seem to find it for the life of me.\nI remember the act being named after someone, the act wasn\u2019t recent, it was based in the 1900\u2019s.\nI know it may not be a lot of help, but that\u2019s all I remember.\nIf anyone knows what I\u2019m talking about, can you please forward me the file or website.

Not in the public\u2019s interest?\nIn contrast, there\u2019s been just one Covid death in Australia since October 2020. Two people are in ICU with C19 nationally.\nThe country has over 92,000 hospital beds. The curve has been well & truly flattened, & yet the hysterical alarmism continues...\nMelbourne locked down for an other 7 days for more coercion to get the jab.\n|24.05.2021||Australia and overseas\n|\nThere have been a number of reports of teens and young adults experiencing heart problems after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.\nMost often, myocarditis develops after a virus either because the virus infected and damaged the heart muscle directly, or because the immune system went into overdrive in response to the virus and attacked the heart muscle by mistake. In this case, he said, the heart muscle damage may occur as late as weeks after the initial infection.\n|24.05.2021||Melbourne\n|\nMy friends mum got the j-a-b\n2 days later she ended up in hospital.\n7 days later she died from organ failure.\nShe wasn't super healthy but at the same time she wasn't going to die in a week...\nOh and she also made 7 other people sick who didn't get the shot...

He was sent home with a suspected urinary tract infection and told to get antibiotics. He bled and suffered for another day and was taken back to the Modbury Hospital by ambulance on Saturday morning. He had to have blood clots removed from his urinary tract and was in emmense agony as he wasn't allowed any pain medication. After persevering through a blunder of inadequate care he was transferred (handballed) to the Lyell McEwin Hospital at around 5pm. Triage was extensively delayed and not tests were done to see where his bleeding was coming from. Once this disgrace of a sideshow was over he was given minimal pain medication and was told he couldn't have anything stronger although still having major abdominal contractions. The nurse told him to not cause any trouble over the night as her shift was ending and she wouldn't get much sleep and she'd be back in the morning to hear about it. He asked when he would have any test to see what was happening and she said maybe tomorrow maybe Monday who knows its the weekend. I informed her that he had had his Covid Vaccine and she shrugged and said yeah I've had mine too and it didn't bother me. His wife and I were told to leave the hospital after visiting hours although no information was given on what was happening. Just before we left he had a really bad cramping pain which was agonising for myself to watch and when it subsided he said he wanted his light left on so he could try and read his newspaper The Australian because he knew he wasn't going to get any sleep. It then took 3 hours to transfer my Dadd who had a stroke in a hospital, untreated to the Royal Adelaide Hospital. He suffered major damage to his brain all the while still bleeding into what he sarcastically referred to the day before being his rose bag. They performed an operation to clear the blood clots in his brain which was unsuccessful. Information and communication or lack of from participating hospitals only added to the lack of fastness or even knowledge of what to do for him added to the undue care that had been administered. Told once again to a nurse that he had the covid vaccine to which I got a shoulder shrug reply. (I have this on video) Then began a long and torcherous day and night of insurmountable pain, agitation and what I can only describe as a hell of a fight to live and breathe. He was moved to the ICU in the early hours of Monday morning. When I spoke with the ICU doctor he had no idea of all this information and had to follow up to find out, no information from Modbury Hospital has been given to us at this stage. Monday afternoon he was put on a ventilator and has been hanging on like the bloody trooper he is.\nMy Dad is True Blue Aussie and deserves more respect than this disgraceful service the SA Health Departments have provided, all the while trying to disregard and sweep the covid vaccine under the rug. Well that is NOT going to happen and he may not be able to speak but my voice will not be silenced.\nTag away and talk it up because this should not happen to anyone. This man is not a statistic, He is My Dad!\nThis is not a urinary infection Modbury Hospital and it is not good enough!! What duty of care??!!\nRead the\nUPDATE 24/5 SADLY Will Shadoan William Clive Haddon PASSED AWAY\n|19.05.2021||Brisbane\n|\nThe account below is from a very close friend in Qld. Please read and share. We need to get this information out to people as the medical fraternity are blatantly ignoring the evidence.\nSorry about this being a group email, but I have some very disturbing news to share. Last wed my mother was given the Astrazenica jab. This was done behind my back, as my family knew I would not consent. 24 -35 hours later my mum experienced some sort of 'event' most likely a mini stroke of some kind which left her unable to speak properly. She was admitted to hospital on the Saturday morning in a critical state. Yesterday afternoon, less than a week after the shot, she passed away from multiple organ failure at the Redcliff hospital in Brisbane. Despite mentioning to several of the doctors who saw her that she had the shot just prior to falling ill none of them were prepared to make any connection between the shot and her condition. None of them even asked which shot had been used. The only person who asked this question was the dietitian, who looked concerned when I told him it was the Astrazenica, the same 'vaccine' which has been banned from many countries due to blood clots. When asked if this would be entered into any database due to he 'possible' connection to the vaccine I was told by one doctor NO, it would not be recorded anywhere because her platelet count was normal. This proved that it could not be even remotely connected. They never checked to see if she had had a stroke. Due to her inability to speak, she was never able to tell us what had happened, why she was lying on the floor unable to move, or how long she had been there. I found irrefutable proof of menstrual bleeding, which I have heard is quite a common reaction to the jabs. I am keeping this as evidence if needed. She was 83 years old. My mother was a beautiful, caring person and had no health issues to speak of apart from the usual frailties you would expect from someone her age. I will not let my my mothers story go unheard like all the others, and I will make sure it goes to all the databased of vacc injuries which are being compiled. If anyone has any information on where to find these databases could you please let me know. Please feel free to share this story.\n|22.05.2021||Sydney\n|\nMy mate got buried on Friday just gone.\nHe walked into the doctor one afternoon, got his Astrazeneca#1 and by the next morning he couldn't walk, talk or hold his bowel.\ud83d\ude4f\n|22.05.2021||TGA\n|\nTotal adverse event reports to 16 May 2021\n6.4 Reporting rate per 1000 doses\n19,598 Total AEFI reports received\n3,073,502 Total doses administered\n13,574 Total reports for AZ vaccine\n5843 Total reports for Comirnaty\n181 Total reports for brand not specified\n|22.05.2021||Queensland nurse update\n|\nThe 18 Year Old Girl Who Had Blood Clots After Receiving The AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine:\nNow must take 4 pages of medications for 6 months, which include:\n- Apixaban (Stroke & Blood Clot Medication)\n- Prednisolone (Used for Blood Disorders)\n- Pantoprazole (Treats the Throat/Stomach)\n- Amoxicillin (Bacterial, Pneumonia infection)\n- Paracetamol (Pain, Headaches, Fever)\n- Weekly Blood Tests\n- Monthly CT Scans\nBut the Australian Government & Therapeutic Goods Administration will continue to say:\n- \u201cIt\u2019s safe and effective...\u201d\n- \u201cThe benefits outweigh the risks...\u201d\n- \u201cThe age cut off at 50+ prevents it from affecting younger people, because \u2018sCiEnCe...\u2019\n- \u201cOne size (vaccine) fits all...\u201d\nThis is absolutely ridiculous and should not be happening... especially to an 18 year old nurse from Queensland.\n|22.05.2021||Adelaide S.A.\n|\nWell here in Adelaide we have two men in hospital with blood clots One in his 50.s who according to the news bulletin tonight No further announcement re his health at present The other man in his 70's evidently went to hospital with stomach pains ,told it was a urine infection and sent home with anti biotics Now on life support Both having had the Astra Zenica Could not believe MSM was telling this story\nFemale medical Dr on tv tonight when the 18yr old Qld nurse was being interviewed , regarding her blood clots ,and the problems she had prior to being diagnosed It was two and half weeks after getting the jab The medical people would not have a bar of it having anything to do with the jab The girl knew herself it was ,but now the medical people have acknowledged it was the jab This Dr stated that ONLY 22 PEOPLE in Australia have suffered from blood clots ,but in the last SIX WEEKS the medical staff now know how to treat these people ,and no one should put off in getting the jab This really beggars belief\nWhen anyone got injured or died with v$$$ne$ in the past ,they were withdrawn ,but not this one this really is Genocide The amount of injuries around the world and the deaths\n|22.05.2021||Sydney\n|\nA friend of mine had Astra Thursday.

The neighbour had also apparently died under the anaesthetic from heart failure while they were treating his legs. He said, \"All my blood disappeared! I don't know where it went!\" My guess is he had been bleeding internally and it had come out as black fecal matter. He said they had had to pump gallons of blood into him! One of his eyes looked large and glassy too, and I wondered what other brain damage he might have had. I asked him whether he had been vaccinated and he said, \"Yes! About a month ago, and I think that is what caused all this!\" I agreed with him. I didn't like to tell him his problems are likely to continue. Anyway, he's changed his mind about getting the next shot!\nThat was my first experience of side effects in someone I actually know.\n|22.05.2021||Australia\n|\nYesterday my GP asked me if I wanted to get a Covid vaccination at the medical centre. This is the second time he has asked me; the first was about four weeks ago.\nI told him the same thing I said the first time: \" Thanks. I'm not against it, but given the side effects I've been reading about, and the fact I survived 2020 without one, I'd prefer to wait and see how 2021 (and the live human trial) turns out.\"\nHe didn't pressure me, and I appreciate his concern, because I am in several high risk groups if I were ever to catch the dreaded Covid.\nCuriously though he did mention that I'd be OK getting vaccinated, because I'm on blood thinners (Xarelto and aspirin). So he does know it's an issue.\n|22.05.2021||Australia\n|\nFrom my brother this morning... Sandra is his partner... \"Sandra's mum went to hospital feeling sick they said she was in a bad way so they gave her the vaxination half hour later she died\". It makes me so mad, why would they give it to an already sick older person ... ( I would say they won't even list it due to the vax, as she is old and was feeling unwell, I wonder how many of our aged are dying when given the vax, but it's not reported as such, and you can't prove it)\n|22.05.2021||Yarra valley, Victoria\n|\nA good friend of mine had the first AZ v\u00e0cz a few weeks ago. She had quite a significant reaction to it. Spend two days in bed with a fever, headaches, sweating, muscle soreness, lethargy.\nIn the following weeks she had a very sore neck, which bothered her quite a bit.\nLast Thursday, she had a stroke.\nFortunately she survived. She spent 5 days in hospital and now recovering at home. The MRI showed that she had a stroke that came from a blood clot in her neck.\nShe is only 39. Otherwise a fit and healthy person. Slim, eats well, doesn\u2019t smoke. She an emergency services worker, which is why she got it.\nWhy am I telling you this? Because you won\u2019t hear about it any other way. People need to know what is happening to others in your community but our government will not admit what is happening. There are probably many other people that are suffering too.\n|19.05.2021||Australia\n|\nI\u2019ve been given permission to share this information from a person I know first hand who had the AZ a couple of weeks ago and has been off sick since. I finally caught up with them face to face last night. They told me that shortly after having it, they couldn\u2019t walk, leg spasms and couldn\u2019t stop vomiting, ended up in hospital. At the beginning of the year they\u2019d had their blood serology taken to show that they had antigens present to protect from communicable diseases such as measles and pertussis ( mandatory job requirement), results showed they had antigens ( protection). For some reason, probably because they wanted to check what was going on with their immune system, because they were so sick, they did the serology test again while they were in hospital. Results.. all antigens wiped, no immunity to anything now! Now that\u2019s really scary and it makes you wonder how many other people this is happening to as this blood testing isn\u2019t a routine test. The TGA has been notified and has been in touch with them, but has advised them to be cautious as they have yet to conclude that there is any correlation between what has happened to them and the shot! What\u2019s just as concerning is that Dr has advised not to have the second shot but better to follow up with the Pf...er one instead!! Oh, and needing to have all those other shots again for their job requirements!\n|19.05.2021||Brisbane\n|\nUpdate: boss was at work today....not 100% but there...\nIt was the astra dose and apparently getting himself ready for jab number 2\nYesterday I was travelling with a good friend to attend a freedom rally and my friend informs me her eldest daughters workplace staff (in Brisbane) were scheduled to get jab on Friday just gone! Her daughter was not getting it but the other 18 staff were lined up behind their boss ready for it.\nThe boss was first and after administration he immediately dropped to the ground unconscious and started having a seizure! They called an ambulance and the staff while shaking theirs heads ran out of the room refusing injection!\nI don\u2019t know the outcome of the victim but I thank him for saving 18 other souls!\n|18.05.2021||Lazy TGA\n|\nOver 11,000 Adverse Event Reports are sitting with the TGA for review.\n|18.05.2021||Adelaide\n|\nHi there, I've just gotten out of hospital after discovering I had a blood clot in my lung. I had received my first AZ COVID vaccine on the 07 April, and approximately 2 weeks later I had symptoms from my collar bone, to my lower back. I had gone to 2 GP's as I was struggling to breathe, was in constant agony and couldn't sleep from the pain. They both advised me that I had probably pulled a muscle and prescribed me some anti-imflammatories. After dealing with this for a week I finally went back as the pain wasn't improving and I had also coughed up a tiny bit of blood. After then being admitted with a blood clot, they've advised that they don't think its from the vaccine as I was also on the pill. They've also said that I need to report this as they wouldn't. After a scary experience, and now needing to be on blood thinners for 6 months minimum, I feel like there definitely needs to be more discussion around this. Also, I'm from SA and recieved my vaccination a couple of days before they advised under 50's not to get it.\n|18.05.2021||India\n|\nA second Australian has died in India from coronavirus.\nSolar pioneer Govind Kant passed away at Delhi hospital after contracting COVID-19 in late April.

She got the Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday, Wednesday morning she had a seizure and fell unconscious. She was unconscious for 6 days. Finally she has started to come to. I hope she just keeps getting better but I'm worried. She's 88. My family don't think it's connected to the vaccine.\nShe's never had seizures before. The doctors say they have no idea why she was unconscious for 6 days. My family think it must be the gallbladder infection that she has since been found to have.\nIt is madness. To begin with the doctors were saying that it can't be the vaccine because a reaction would either happen immediately or two weeks later, 12 hours didn't fit the timeline of being an adverse reaction. I thought that was weird.\n|16.05.2021||Pert W.A.\n|\nOne of my clients had the vaccine ended up with excessively high blood pressure and admitted to hospital with ambulance, she had all 12 reactions documented.

Apparently feeling normal now.\nFull health details unknown, but nothing was mentioned of previous/underlying conditions.\nFrom Queensland, Australia.\nHe will be getting the next injection, but a requirement will be someone to stay with him the first night.\n|20.04.2021||Sydney NSW\n|\n2 of my customers that were about to set off on a 12 month caravan holiday around Australia decided to get the jab before setting off to avoid any problems whilst touring, well that didn't go as planned.\nDon has a bad heart and had zero side effects but on the other hand Margret his wife has this going on, every third day to a tee 1. profusely watering eyes, 2. chronic diarrea 3. temps to 41 4. zero energy\n5. chronic stomach cramps and lastly sore / itchy throat this lasts a few hours each time but it is every 3 days on point, asked her why she took the jab answer was i didn't want border issues\nif COVID enforcements keep going ahead, feeling sorry for her, and they have gone ahead on the trip but had to take epi pens and a whole list of drugs, plus an EPIRB, SAT phone, etc etc etc\nand suggested to stay near hospitals is there only way to do the holiday and lastly neither of them had any underlying conditions that were not addressed before the jab,\nso Don is still ok (has a crap heart), but no side effects and Marg is now a basket case., i've asked them to keep in touch with me as they travel and will update as i get the info so for now IMHO \"DON'T DO IT PEEPS\".\n|20.04.2021||South Australia\n|\nA fellow Health Care Worker at my hospital had the 1st injection.

Now they do not vaccinate staff as a large wirkplace group as the hospital can not afford to have so many away on sick leave at the one time.\n|20.04.2021||Taree NSW\n|\nSeveral people reported to see a news item on channel 7 TV about a man in Taree who died after the jab. The news item disappeared shortly afterwards and is nowhere to be found. MSM is very silent on such items.\n|19.04.2021||Sydney, Australia:\n|\n\u201cMy godparents have just told us a horrendous story about this! Here though, in the north shore of Sydney! His mother was in a nursing home and last week the residents were all given the astra va((\nFollowing the injection, 11 of them had blot clots leading to strokes! My godfathers mother had a secondary clot in her bowels, which they said they could remove but as she was on life support after the stroke they decided to switch it off. So she had the astra vx and within days was dead. A nurse came to the funeral and said that they\u2019ve been reporting the blot clots in the elderly and the gov has flat out said they refuse to investigate or admit there is a link because \u201cthey\u2019re over 80 and they have strokes anyway\u201d!!! 11 strokes in the 1-2 days following the vx is a bit more than the usual. They\u2019re literally killing off older people with it.\u201d\n|17.04.2021||TGA admits minors mistakenly given AstraZeneca vaccine\n|\nMore than a dozen teenagers as young as 14 have been given the AstraZeneca jab despite there being no vaccine approved for use in minors in Australia, as the Therapeutic Goods Administration confirmed\nRead more\n|13.04.2021||Private message sent in today via a retired HCP/Nurse in South Australia.\n|\nReally appreciate your support re informing us of the realities relating to these vaccines. What a disaster this is! Thought you might be interested to know a very close friend of mine suffered a heart attack yesterday. She had the Astrazeneca vacc on Saturday with nasty reaction almost immediately. Come Monday she dragged herself to work, she is a Registered Nurse. A couple of hours into her shift developed severe pain and breathlessness. Admitted to hospital and found to have a heart attack. Still in hospital, 52 years of age.\nNot good\n|12.04.2021||Sydney NSW\n|\nMy fathers friend had 1st jab. Astrazeneca.\n3 days after he needed an emergency MRI.\nThey confirmed clotting nr the retina and optic nerve.\nThe next day these ruptured. He's now 90% blind.\nHe walked in a healthy man.\n|18.04.2021||Western Australia\n|\nMy wife's friend (Liz is 74) had the Astra Zenica jab about 3 weeks ago because she has some immunity issues. After 3 days she developed a tremble in her right leg and went to her doctor to get tested for thrombosis. Luckily she doesn't have thrombosis but looks like she has developed a neurological condition which is causing her leg to tremble and feel like a dead weight (Liz words). Liz advised my wife her doctor told her to not have the second shot under any circumstances. I will let you know if anything else develops with Liz.\n|14.04.2021||TGA reports:\n|\nTGA adverse event reports to 14 April 2021 have increased from 5.4 last week, and 5.7 the week before, to 6.3 per 1000 doses this week.\nTGA have changed the state reports to reporting rates per doses (compared to number of reports per state as noted in my earlier posts).\nVictoria has had 10.8, Tasmania 6.5 and NT 6.1 adverse events reported per 1000 doses.\nTGA continues to note they are investigating whether there is a link between blood clotting disorders and the AstraZeneca vaccine.\nAdverse events of special interest are (Pfizer):\nAnaphylaxis (39 reports)\nBleeding disorder (11 reports)\nFacial weakness (6 reports)\nSeizure (7 reports)\nCardiac event (3 reports)\nLoss of sense of taste or smell (3 reports)\nLiver injury (1 report)\nMuscle damage (1 report)\n|19.04.2021||Australia\n|\nWork colleague was pregnant by ivf was advised by Dr to have vax had miscarriage at 15 weeks husband devastated only spoke to her about not having vax a couple of weeks ago when will people learn\n|19.04.2021||Australia\n|\nI am a registered nurse in an area where only AZ was offered to staff. Fortunately have not been coerced or forced. I just said no and that was that. I declined the jab but I am now really sick with upper respiratory infection.\nWhat happened is that those who went down for their shot came back and were ill in some way within hours.\nOne team member who is in their 20s and no comorbidities has not returned to work for a week.\nA few of them complained of pain in the opposite arm which was a bit of a laugh and a smaller number had coughs and colds, watery eyes, brain fog.\nThey stayed at work as the culture is awful here. The problem is that I worked closely with them and I have been sick for days with hot waves, blocked nose, rough throat and airways,\nweakness and cough. I would advise people to stay away from newly vaccinated people in case you get as sick as I am.\nI wonder how long it will take for them to be safe to be around. I am glad my immune system is fighting back.\n|13.04.2021||Central Coast NSW\n|\nA 48-year-old Australian woman from Lake Macquarie, NSW has died five days after receiving the AstraZeneca jab. The woman was given the jab on Friday and developed blood clots hours later, according to reports. It\u2019s believed she was a diabetic but otherwise in good health. She was placed in an intensive care unit and died on Wednesday (Australian time).\nThe woman worked at the Sanitarium Health Food Company, on the Central Coast NSW. The case is under investigation by the coroner and NSW Health Department.\nThe Australian Health Department said there had been two confirmed cases where Australians who had received the AstraZeneca v@ccine had been sickened with a rare blood clotting disorder known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or TTS. So this is likely a third case of TTS. Despite Denmark and Norway banning the AstraZeneca v@ccine, Australian authorities are still recommending it for people over 50 years of age.\n|13.04.2021||Mark from Australia\n|\nMy story is this. Although I have warned my retired parents about not having this vac, being like most people their age, I was met with a stop being a conspiracy enabler mentality from my whole family basically. 4 days ago they decided to get the shot thanks to the pressure of the main stream propaganda channels. Fast forward 4 days, the old man is fine however my mother has a running nose and dry throat, fatigued and my sister also, who saw her on the weekend. Mum told me she had fatigue the day after the shot, which she never gets. To say I am worried for their health is an understatement. The doctor gave them a pamphlet about the shot after they received it. My question is. How can this be informed consent if they receive the info on the shot after it has been administered. Neither were sure which type of shots they had, and had no clue that these shots were given under provisional use only. Which means you're basically the human guinea pig. Mum told me that her friend who got the shot on the same day ended up with fever and vomiting. I have told her to report adverse reactions to her doctor and TGA. Hopefully they listen to what I have to say about this. People need to know that this kind of adverse reactions are happening everywhere around the world. I am well traveled and have spoken to many people around the world and so many people are getting sick from it. This is the pharma mafia telling lies and taking control as far as I'm concerned. SPEAK UP PEOPLE BEFORE YOU CAN'T SPEAK AT ALL!\n|14.04.2021||Western Australia\n|\nSecond Australian case of blood clots likely linked to AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccination, TGA says\nThe case occurred in a woman in her 40s who was vaccinated in Western Australia.\nRead\n|13.04.2021||Queensland\n|\nSadly these reports aren't coming from those affected. A friend of a friend is a nurse in a Qld hospital. I can't name names, however reports coming from the nurse is how full they are of staff who have had serious reactions to the vacc. 2 girls in their 30's have had strokes ???? staff have been gagged and threatened with being sacked if they speak out about what's happening. Apparently it's even starting to affect how long you wait for an ambulance, up to 2 hours for the broader Brisbane areas!! This is criminal. If you can save a family member from being jabbed I urge you to tell them what's truly happening. Not the lies and cover-ups the media is reporting.

I am the one that actually stood there and had the conversation with him. He told me he was having the vaccine in the afternoon whilst we were at work. I told him to wait as it\u2019s not proven to be safe and so many have died or had major set backs . He said his doctor insisted as he had auto immune issues which is why I said more reason to hold off. He was in his 50\u2019s. I\u2019ve seen people in different countries with testimonials after taking it and they cannot reverse the damage. Many are dead. I told him this. I also said it\u2019s Russian roulette as you don\u2019t know which one you\u2019re getting. Unfortunately I got the call Friday morning that he had passed away Thursday night from a seizure. It saddens me that a life has been taken for absolutely no reason and angers me that so many judge and demand proof and attack someone who has posted a reality check regarding this atrocity towards human kind. This scamdemic has hit close to home for me as you can all see and I still cannot believe he has gone!
