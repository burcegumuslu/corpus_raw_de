Racimir welcomes you to his town! Get the latest news and updates for the 1st/3rd person builder in the year 1000 AD Middle Ages.\nTownsfolk skill balance?\nI've had an observation of a few townsfolk skills and specific work sites. Only 1 single site uses townsfolk diplomacy skill, the stall, and as they sell items their diplomacy moves incredibly fast. Diplomacy at the stall moves faster than any townsfolk skill at any other profession.\nFarmers in the farm shed or barn don't gain farming exp nearly as fast as animal handlers at a chicken coop or pig sty.\nIt also appears that woodcutters get extraction skill faster than miners at the excavation shed. But the absolute worst is the well. Someone put there will remain the same skill they started with until Racimir dies.\nSo I understand there is some metric of how many items are moved or created per day which generates the exp for the townsfolk, which then in turn makes them get more as their level increases. But every bucket filled at the well gives so little exp that the person will never get better at being a water carrier. So that person will never gain more water as your town grows.\nTLDR:\nEx of the problem: Production people in the kitchen will get faster at baking bread. They need more flour, eggs, water. Barn workers get faster at threshing wheat/grinding flour. Animal handler generates more eggs. Water carrier draws the same 1.7 buckets/day until they die.", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["https://reddit.com/en-us/policies/cookies", "https://reddit.com/en-us/policies/privacy-policy", "/", "https://www.reddit.com/login", "https://www.reddit.com/login", "https://ads.reddit.com?utm_source=web3x_consumer&utm_name=user_menu_cta", "/avatar/shop", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage", "https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1064216828", "/r/RealMedievalDynasty/", "/r/RealMedievalDynasty/", "/r/RealMedievalDynasty/", "/user/7CGamer/", "/r/popular/", "https://reddit.com/t/valheim/", "https://reddit.com/t/genshin_impact/", "https://reddit.com/t/minecraft/", "https://reddit.com/t/pokimane/", "https://reddit.com/t/halo_infinite/", "https://reddit.com/t/call_of_duty_warzone/", "https://reddit.com/t/path_of_exile/", "https://reddit.com/t/hollow_knight_silksong/", "https://reddit.com/t/escape_from_tarkov/", "https://reddit.com/t/watch_dogs_legion/", "https://reddit.com/t/nfl/", "https://reddit.com/t/nba/", "https://reddit.com/t/megan_anderson/", "https://reddit.com/t/atlanta_hawks/", "https://reddit.com/t/los_angeles_lakers/", "https://reddit.com/t/boston_celtics/", "https://reddit.com/t/arsenal_fc/", "https://reddit.com/t/philadelphia_76ers/", "https://reddit.com/t/premier_league/", "https://reddit.com/t/ufc/", "https://reddit.com/t/gamestop/", "https://reddit.com/t/moderna/", "https://reddit.com/t/pfizer/", "https://reddit.com/t/johnson_johnson/", "https://reddit.com/t/astrazeneca/", "https://reddit.com/t/walgreens/", "https://reddit.com/t/best_buy/", "https://reddit.com/t/novavax/", "https://reddit.com/t/spacex/", "https://reddit.com/t/tesla/", "https://reddit.com/t/cardano/", "https://reddit.com/t/dogecoin/", "https://reddit.com/t/algorand/", "https://reddit.com/t/bitcoin/", "https://reddit.com/t/litecoin/", "https://reddit.com/t/basic_attention_token/", "https://reddit.com/t/bitcoin_cash/", "https://reddit.com/t/the_real_housewives_of_atlanta/", "https://reddit.com/t/the_bachelor/", "https://reddit.com/t/sister_wives/", "https://reddit.com/t/90_day_fiance/", "https://reddit.com/t/wife_swap/", "https://reddit.com/t/the_amazing_race_australia/", "https://reddit.com/t/married_at_first_sight/", "https://reddit.com/t/the_real_housewives_of_dallas/", "https://reddit.com/t/my_600lb_life/", "https://reddit.com/t/last_week_tonight_with_john_oliver/", "https://reddit.com/t/kim_kardashian/", "https://reddit.com/t/doja_cat/", "https://reddit.com/t/iggy_azalea/", "https://reddit.com/t/anya_taylorjoy/", "https://reddit.com/t/jamie_lee_curtis/", "https://reddit.com/t/natalie_portman/", "https://reddit.com/t/henry_cavill/", "https://reddit.com/t/millie_bobby_brown/", "https://reddit.com/t/tom_hiddleston/", "https://reddit.com/t/keanu_reeves/", "https://www.redditinc.com", "https://ads.reddit.com?utm_source=web3x_consumer&utm_name=left_nav_cta", "https://www.reddithelp.com", "https://redditblog.com/", "https://www.redditinc.com/careers", "https://www.redditinc.com/press", "https://redditinc.com", "/best/communities/150/#t5_7bkwea", "https://www.reddit.com/posts/2023/january-20-1/", "https://www.reddit.com/posts/2023/january/", "https://www.reddit.com/posts/2023/"]}
