the ad hoc  expert panel:  \nTB incident:  Exposure to an infectious TB case with the likely occurrence of TB transmission  in a specific setting.  \nOutbreak:  An incident with two or more epidemiologically linked cases of active TB disease.  \nCongregate setting:  A setting outside the household where children meet in a habitual manner or share a \nlimited space for an extended period  of hours (i.e. schools, kindergartens/day -care centres/nurseries, private day -\ncare services etc.).  \nInfectious TB case:  a case with proof of shedding/excretion of live M. tuberculosis  bacteria. If the results of the \nmicrobiological analysis are pending, ad ult and adolescent patients with respiratory TB should be considered to be \ninfectious until the microbiological results are available.  \nSource case:  The person who brought the infection to a new setting and infected others.  \nContact:  A person who has been exposed to another person with infectious TB, by sharing air space with, the so -\ncalled source case.  \nIndex case:  A person with suspected or confirmed TB disease, who is defined as the initial case detected by the \nhealth care system or by the health authorit ies prompting a contact investigation. The index case is not necessarily \nthe source case. For the purpose of this document, c ontacts may be children or adults with evidence of prolonged \nand frequent exposure to the index case in a congregate setting.  \nSource finding:  The investigation undertaken where the aim is to identify the source case, i.e. the case that \ninfected the index case.  \nContact investigation:  The investigation undertaken where the aim is to identify possible contacts infected by a \nsource c ase with infectious TB.  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nECDC  GUIDANCE  Investigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings  \n \n \n \n1 \n \n \n Executive summary \nThe challenge  \nYoung children who are exposed to people with infectious tuberculosis (TB) have an increased risk of developing \nTB disease if infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis . The risk for children becoming infected following exposure \nis the highest through close contact with an infectious person (for example in the household) but also in congregate settings such as schools and nurseries. Most children will progress to develop TB disease within one \nyear after being infected, and as such , childhood TB is an indicato r of ongoing transmission within a community. \nInfants and young children are particularly prone to develop severe forms of TB disease and early detection is \nimportant for successful treatment. Thus, to rapidly identify the source case of infection and perf orm contact \ninvestigation around the case is essential for interrupting the transmission to avoid additional infected cases. To \nstop the transmission of \nM. tuberculosis to children is an essential step towards eliminating TB, as infected children \nwill serv e as a pool of infection for future generations.  \nThis document focuses on TB transmission potentially taking place in congregate settings where children are \npresent. We referred to this as a TB incident, as only through investigation can it be determined i f a verified \noutbreak with two or more linked cases of TB disease has taken place or not. Tuberculosis incidents in these settings are often challenged by the potentially large scale of the investigations to identify the source case and \nexposed contacts. A s TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings often generate anxiety and publicity, \ncommunication requires special attention in the management of these incidents.  \nPublic health guidance  \nAn assessment of current national practices of TB incident s and verified outbreaks affecting children in congregate \nsettings was done towards developing this document. The assessment identified that most EU/EEA Member States often follow similar approaches in the investigation and control of incidents and verifie d outbreaks. The approaches \nused are guided by policies or guidelines which are general for generic outbreak management and complemented \nwith TB guidelines for contact investigation.  \nECDC aimed to bring the different components of generic outbreak managem ent and TB specific policies and \nguidelines together, to develop a more comprehensive package of guidance to capture the elements that are \nspecific for TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings. The purpose of this document is to provide the \nMember States with expert consensus opinions that can aid the development of national policies and guidelines in \nthe topic.  \nCommon practices and expert opinions  \nThis document summarises current common practices and the opinions of the expert panel on good practices for \nthe investigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings. As the investigation and \ncontrol measures of TB incidents cover several sub- topics the document is divided into several chapters and \nsections related to t he specific sub- topics.  \nThe expert panel defines a TB incident as the exposure to an infectious TB case with the likely occurrence of TB \ntransmission including outbreaks in a specific setting. An outbreak is defined as an incident with two or more \nepidemi ologically linked cases of active TB disease. Thus for the purpose of this guidance document the term \u2018TB \nincident\u2019 is used throughout as it also includes outbreaks.  \nEven though young children with TB disease are generally not considered to be infectious, they represent an event \nof recent transmission from someone else in the near environment. Therefore, a case of TB in a child should \nalways stimulate the initiation of both source finding and contact investigation. The investigation should be \ntriggered wher e an adult with infectious TB is working in/attending a congregate setting; if a child or adolescent \nwith infectious TB attending a congregate setting is detected, and; if there is a child with non -infectious TB (any \nsite of infection) and where no other s ource has been identified outside of the congregate setting.  \nThe nature of the type of investigation undertaken will depend on the index case. In incidents where the index \ncase is an infectious TB case, contact investigations with the aim of  fining infecte d contacts is the priority. In \nincidents where the index case is a (non -infectious) child with TB, there is a need to undertake source finding with \nthe aim to find the individual who infected the child, with subsequent contact tracing around the suspected source \ncase. If the source is not found among the household contacts, the source finding investigation should be \nexpanded to congregate settings where the child could possibly have been exposed.   \n \n \n \nInvestigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings   ECDC  GUIDANCE  \n \n \n \n2 \n \n \n As in any case where rapid action is needed, preparedness and planning is essential for good performance. This is \ntrue also for the investigation and control of TB incidents, in order to rapidly stop transmission and prevent disease \ndevelopment. Therefore the expert panel highlights that a TB incident management pla n should be written and \navailable at national and local level before a TB incident occurs and it should include a communication plan due to \nthe often high demands of communication around these incidents. The incident management plan should also \nspecify the  roles and responsibilities of involved expertise present in the team investigating a TB incident. In the \ncase of TB incidents affecting children, it will be important to consult paediatric expertise to guide the management \nof infected or sick children as needed.  \nThe principles of screening for TB infection are the same regardless of the age of the index case and contacts and \nfollows what is often named \u201cprogressive, concentric circles\u201d or \u201cstone -in-the-pond\u201d principle. Young children are \ngiven a higher pri ority in the contact investigations compared to other contacts of similar exposure due to their \ngreater susceptibility to TB infection and high risk of progression to active TB disease.  \nThe diagnosis and management of latent TB infection and active TB disease among children should follow existing national and international guidelines. The expert panel however stresses that young children are at increased risk \nof progression to TB disease if infected, and is a group that benefit the most from chemoprophylax is and \npreventive treatment. Provision of chemoprophylaxis and preventive treatment should always follow after an individual risk assessment to evaluate the benefits and potential harm or adverse events of the treatment.  \nThe assessment of current national practices suggests that information on incidents and outbreaks  is often not \nsystematically collected and analysed, which leads to  a missed opportunity to learn from previous incident and \noutbreak investigations. The expert panel therefore promotes more ana lysis of information on TB incidents and \noutbreaks to evaluate/assess that adequate responses are in place, and to assess lessons learned, in order to improve the investigation and management of future incidents.  \nConclusion  \nWith this document, ECDC promote s and encourage Member States to raise the profile of childhood TB in national \nTB prevention and co ntrol strategies and guidelines, t aking into consideration that the specific needs of children \nare important to ensure that all individuals, including childr en, are getting the highest quality of care.  \n   \n \n \n \nECDC  GUIDANCE  Investigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings  \n \n \n3 \n \n \n 1 Introduction  \n1.1 Current situation \nThe spread of tuberculosis (TB) occurs mainly in settings where prolonged contact between people promotes the \ntransmission from an infectious \u2018source case\u2019 with TB disease to one or several \u2018contacts\u2019. A main component in \ncontaining the spread of TB is to rapidly diagnose and treat infectious TB cases so that the chain of transmission \ncan be interrupted. It is also necessary to trace people who have been in contact with the source case and are \nlikely to have been exposed to infection. Screening of the identified contacts for their infection status allows the \ndetection of latent TB infection (LTBI) or active TB disease. Diagnosing LTBI aims at identifying individuals who \nwould  benefit from preventive treatment or follow -up with careful clinical observation, thus reducing the risk of \nfuture development of TB disease and promoting early detection.  \nChildren, especially those under the age of five , and adolescents are vulnerable groups that, when infected, are at \nhigher risk of progressing to active TB disease. Childhood TB has long been a relatively overlooked area for TB \ncontrol, despite the fact that children under the age of 15 years account for over 1 million of the estimated 9 \nmillion cases of TB occurring annually in the world [ 1]. In the European Union/ European Economic Area  (EU/EEA) \nMember States, the proportion of overall cases attributable to children under 15 years of age has been reported to \nbe approximately 5% [ 2].  \nGiven the recent changes in TB epidemiology in low -incidence countries, with a resurgence of cases and a failure in \nfurther TB decline, we now observe a renewed emphasis on ensuring correct monitoring, prevention and \nmanagement of childhood TB. The notion that childhood TB represents a sentinel event of recent transmission, and \nthat infected children represent a potential pool for disease in their adult life, further highlights the need for in \ndepth analysis and knowledge of the epidemiology and control of childhood TB in settings such as the EU/EEA \nMember States.  \nWhen TB occurs among children or staff within congregate settings such as schools and nurseries, this represents an incident where children and staff potentially can be infected. Such incidents ge nerate a great deal of anxiety \namong parents, children and staff, and there is frequently associated publicity around these incidents. Therefore \ncontact investigations in these settings are delicate. Investigative and management actions may be challenged by the potentially large number of contacts, difficulties in determining the level of exposure, and prioritising whom to \nscreen.  \n1.2 Scope and purpose of this guidance  \nECDC aims to provide EU/EEA Member States with guidance on good practice for the investigation and control of TB incidents affecting children and adolescents aged less than 18 years. The scope of this guidance is intended to \nbe limited to the investigation and control of TB incidents affecting children occurring in congregate settings \noutside the household, such as schools and nurseries.  \nThis guidance document presents current common practices, evidence and expert opinion regarding good practices \nfor the investigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings, in or der to provide \nMember States with support when considering the topic in national TB programmes and/or TB control strategies. It provides Member States with considerations that can aid the development of national documents.   \n \n \n \nInvestigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings   ECDC  GUIDANCE  \n \n \n \n4 \n \n \n 1.3 Document development  \nAssessm ent of current practices  \nIn order to provide an overview of current national practices on how TB incidents and verified outbreaks affecting \nchildren in congregate settings have been managed, two systematic literature reviews were carried out, supported \nby the administration of a questionnaire to EU/EEA Member States, whose findings were further integrated by \nphone interviews. It should be noted that the definition used for the background assessment was different from the one which the expert panel later agr eed upon for the purpose of this guidance document. The assessment \nfocused on collecting information on incidents and verified outbreaks with the \u2018 occurrence of at least one case of \nactive TB disease in a child aged 0 -14 years, attending a congregate setti ng for children, which prompted contact \ninvestigation and identification of a possible source case\u2019 ; or, the \u2018 occurrence of an adult active TB index case in a \ncongregate setting for children, which prompted contact investigation for the identification of L TBI and/or active \nTB disease in children aged 0 to 14 years\u2019 .  \nThe literature reviews were developed with the specific aims to: (i) assess the impact of childhood TB incidents and \nverified outbreaks on the national TB burden; and (ii) describe the evidence on reported practices in the \nidentification and management of TB incidents and verified outbreaks affecting children  in the EU/ EEA Member \nStates and selected non EU/EEA low TB incidence countries (i.e. Australia, Canada, United States of America and New Zealand).  \nIn March 2012, ECDC approached all EU/EEA Member States about their willingness to take part in a survey on TB incidents and verified outbreaks affecting children. The majority of the Member States expressed their support and \nagreed to respond t o the survey. A survey was therefore developed and conducted with the aim to identify \nunpublished data and collect information to gain understanding of: (i) the estimated impact of TB incidents and verified outbreaks affecting children on the overall epidemiological situation of TB among children in the EU/EEA \nMember States; and (ii) the public health policies, recommendations and current EU/EEA Member States policies, \nguidelines and practices for the management of TB incidents and verified outbreaks affect ing children.  \nExpert panel  \nAn ad hoc  expert panel was set -up in order to assess the work of the background assessment, and subsequently \nexpress consensus opinions on good practices for triggering investigation and control of TB incidents and \noutbreaks aff ecting children. The panel members were identified by ECDC\u2019s chief scientist and the TB programme \nexperts by use of the ECDC Expert Directory, by searching the literature for potential experts that publish on related topics, and by professional contacts th rough the ECDC TB Surveillance and other networks and working \ngroups. The \nad hoc  expert panel was officially appointed by the ECDC director. The experts were selected based \non their expertise in the different areas of outbreak investigations, TB control an d clinical medicine \u2013  including \npaediatric infectious diseases - , and health communication. The experts were asked to provide opinions based on \ntheir professional and scientific merits. The expert opinions expressed are to be considered as personal \nprofessional advice of the expert, and the experts are not representing the interests of a commercial body, a \nMember State or a professional body. The expert opinions expressed should be regarded as independent scientific \npanel opinions. All members signed a decl aration of interest, which was reviewed by the ECDC compliance officer . \nNone of the members of the panel declared any conflicting interests in regard to the discussed topics. The panel \nwas independent from ECDC, which organised, hosted and observed the pan el meeting.  \nTable 1.

Thereafter, an expert panel \nmeeting was organi sed in Stockholm, April 2013. Subsequent to the expert panel meeting, a draft of the guidance \ndocument was prepared by ECDC and circulated in several rounds to the expert panel from June through \nSeptember 2013. A complete version was prepared by ECDC in October 2013. The pre- final document was \ncirculated to the ECDC Advisory Forum for input , and after incorporation of some suggestions the final document \nwas approved by the ECDC chief scientist in November 2013. The guidance provided here is based on the evidence \navailable at the time of  the expert panel meeting in April 2013. In the event of emergence of new evidence \nstrongly affecting the opinions expressed, this guidance document will be updated in line with the new evidence.  \nDocument format  \nThe main part of the document is the summary  of current common practices and the expert opinions on good \npractices. As the investigation and control measures of TB incidents cover several sub- topics, these have been \ndivided into several chapters and sections. For each section, we present current com mon practices as derived from \nthe assessment of current national practices, provide the evidence and present a short practise rationale related to the specific sub- topic, followed by the expert opinions formulated as good practices. As the evidence base is  very \nweak for several of the expert opinions expressed, we have also included a chapter on future research needs, as \nidentified by the expert panel, the contractors performing the assessment of practices, and by ECDC.  \n   \n \n \n \nInvestigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings   ECDC  GUIDANCE  \n \n \n \n6 \n \n \n 2 Background  \n2.1 Childhood TB epide miology  \nEstimates from different parts of the world suggest that TB disease among children up to 15 years of age \nconstitute at least 10 -20% of the global TB burden [ 1,3,4]. \nA comprehensive situational analysis of childhood TB in the EU/EEA in the last decade (2000 \u20132009) showed that \n39 695 paediatric TB cases were notified in the EU/EEA, accounting for 4.3% of al l notified cases reported overall \nduring that period [ 5]. During the past decade, the EU/EEA overall paediatric notification rates dropped from 5.5 \nper 100  000 in 2000 to 4.0 per 100 000 in 2011 [ 2]. Globally, the diagnosis of TB in children is less frequently \nconfir med by culture than in adults. This is largely explained by the paucibacillary nature of disease in this age \ngroup, higher rates of extra -pulmonary disease than in adults and the difficulty to produce sputum in children \nbelow 10 years of age. Clinical and radiological signs of TB on chest x -ray are less specific and pronounced \ncompared to adults. A close link with an index case should always prompt investigation for TB in a child. Overall, \nduring the last decade in the EU/EEA confirmation by culture of paediatric cases has increased from 14.1% in 2000 \nto 19.2% in 2009 [ 5]. There is however large variation across the EU/EEA Member States, where certain countries \nreach above 50% or even 60% culture confirmation of paediatric cases and others confirm only below  10% of the \ncases.  \nThe study by Sandgren et al. also revealed a poor correlation between childhood TB and overall rates (i.e. low \nincidence settings revealed disproportionately high or increasing childhood TB notification compared to their overall \ntrends).  This poor correlation could be attributable to a number of factors. One hypothesis is that the figures on \nchildhood TB might be particularly sensitive to TB outbreaks due to the small absolute number of cases in contrast \nto overall epidemiological trends [ 5]. \nThe finding of increasing numbers of paediatric TB cases clearly highlights the need to pay special attention to transmission of TB to this vulnerable group and to early detection and control of outbreaks affecting children. This  \nis critical to overall TB control and represents an important component towards elimination of the disease in \nEurope.  \n2.2 Epidemiology of TB affecting children in congregate \nsettings  \nSystematic literature reviews, a survey and in -depth interviews were undertaken to provide background \ninformation for the development of this guidance document (see Chapter 1.3). The systematic review collected \nevidence from the literature on published descriptions of TB incidents and verified outbreaks affecting children in \ncongregate settings in the EU/EEA during the period 2004 \u20132011. Ten included articles [ 6-15] reported on ten \ndifferent verified outbreaks occurring in five EU/EEA Member States: Irelan d (n=1), Italy (n=3), Spain (n=1), \nSweden (n=2), and United Kingdom (n=3). The outbreaks occurred either in a primary/junior school (4/10) or in a \nnursery (4/10), one occurred in a hospital maternity ward (1/10) and one in a secondary school (1/10).  \nThe n umber of children examined ranged from 29 [ 13] to 1 340 [6]. The number of children below 15 years of age \ndiagnosed with active TB disease within the outbreaks ranged from a single case [ 6] in a maternity ward outbreak, \nto 27 children in a primary school outbreak [ 15]. The detection rate varied from 0.08% [ 6] to 38% [ 13]. Paediatric \nTB cases detec ted in these outbreaks accounted for 0.5% [ 6] to 48.6% [ 11] of the overall number of reported \npaediatric TB cases in the respective country for the year of the outbreak. In five of eight studies outbreaks \ncontributed to 10% or less to the overall national burden of paediatric TB.  \nThe number of children below 15 years of age diagnosed with LTBI ranged from nine  cases in a primary school \noutbreak [15] to 118 in a maternity ward outbreak [ 6]. The LTBI detection rate varied from 6.2% [ 7] to 34.5% \n[13]. The number of LTBI cases among children attributable to outbreaks cannot be estimated as most countries \ndo not have national notification data available on LTBI.  \nTo support the data retrieved from the systematic review, a survey was conducted to gain further understanding of the estimated impact of TB outbreaks affecting children on the overall epidemiology of paediatric TB in the EU/EEA. \nOf the 30 countries invited to participate in the survey, 25 responded to the questionnaire. Sixteen countries had \ninformation on verified outbre aks or in some cases also TB incidents, either through notifications in the national \nsurveillance systems or based on unofficial estimates. High variability in number of outbreaks and children affected \nwas observed among the 25 survey responders. While fiv e countries reported no outbreaks, the United Kingdom \nstood out with 419 events during the period 2004 \u20132011, including both incidents and verified outbreaks.   \n \n \n \nECDC  GUIDANCE  Investigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings  \n \n \n7 \n \n \n Ten countries provided information on the number of TB cases among children found by active case finding and \npotentially attributable to outbreaks. Of these countries, some reported a high percentage of children with TB \nidentified through outbreak investigations, such as 21.7% in Ireland and 19.5% in the Czech Republic. In Norway, \nno childhood TB case s were identified through outbreak investigation. Overall, 6.1% of the childhood TB cases \nwere attributable to outbreaks.  \nOnly five countries for which there are notification data or estimates for latent TB infection, reported the number of children with L TBI identified in outbreak investigations. In these countries, 0.2 to 44.3% of children with LTBI were \nidentified through outbreak investigations.  \nBoth the systematic review and the survey study give estimates that show the great heterogeneity across different \nEU/EEA Member States. The core finding of the studies is that the epidemiological information on TB cases and \nlatently infected children detected within outbreak investigations are not sufficiently detailed to allow a precise \ndescription of their epid emiological impact within the EU/EEA. There were large uncertainties for both studies. The \nsystematic review is limited by a large under -reporting because of publication bias,  as not all outbreaks are \npublished. The survey study is limited by the lack of n ational notification through routine surveillance of how \nindividual TB cases have been detected. In many Member States detailed information on outbreaks is available on a regional/local level, but not collated at national level.  \n2.3 Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI)  \nUpon exposure and inhalation of airborne droplets containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis , a proportion of \nindividuals will be infected and the majority of these develop an immune response that contains the infection. \nThese individuals are as ymptomatic but infected. LTBI has been defined as presumptive infection with M. \ntuberculosis  complex (usually M. tuberculosis ), as evidenced by a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) and/or a \npositive interferon -gamma release assay (IGRA), in the absence of  any clinically or radiological signs of disease [16] \n[17]. Individuals with LTBI are not a source of infection. It is estimated that 5 to 10% of adult immunocompetent \nindividuals with LTBI will develop TB disease during their lifetime. Some groups are at higher risk of progression to \nTB disease once infected, such as infants,  children under five years of age and adolescents [17-22]. The risk of \nprogressing from LTBI to TB disease in these groups is about 20% to 40% depending on age, with the youngest carrying the highest risk of disease progression. The majority of TB disease in children generally develop s within \nthe first year after infection. In the event of immunosuppression either induced (e.g. during transplantation; anti -\ntumour necrosis factor (TNF) -medication) or acquired (e.g. HIV infection), the risk of reactivating TB from LTBI is \nalso increased in adults [23].  \n2.4 TB disease in children  \nChildren bear severe tuberculosis- related morbidity and mortality and consti tute a significant proportion of the \ndisease burden [1,4,5,24,25]. Children, particularly infants under two years of age or immunocompromised (e.g. \nchildren with HIV), have the highest risk of developing life- threatening forms of TB disease, including disseminated \nforms such as TB meningitis or miliary TB [ 26].  \nThe clinical presentation of TB differs in children from adults. Symptoms and signs are often non -specific and vary \nfrom minor to life threatening. The clinical presentation of TB in children can be diverse [ 27], and can affect \nbasically any organ; however, the most common form of paediatric TB disease is pulmonary TB, and children are more likely to present with primary TB, characteri sed by pulmonary infiltrates and/or hilar adenopathy [ 21]. \nBacteriological confirmation is difficult to obtain in early disease but the combination of recent household contact, immunologic evidence of TB infection and radiographic signs on the chest allows accur ate diagnosis in most cases \n[21,27,28]. International standards recommend sputum induction, bronchoscopy and nasop haryngeal and gastric \nlavage in children to obtain samples for culture and drug sensitivity testing [ 28].  \nIn children with a p ositive TST, symptoms suggestive of TB, or known contact(s) with an adult TB case, the \npresence of active TB disease is investigated by clinical examination.  \nThere are differences in the risk of being infectious for children, adolescents and small children respectively [ 21]. \nThe typical transmitter is an adult with cavitary pulmona ry tuberculosis, a chronic productive cough and strongly \npositive sputum smears. These characteristics do however very rarely occur in children, as they are often not \ncapable of producing sputum and frequently have paucibacillary disease [ 24]. Children are therefore generally not \ninfectious. In addit ion, due to the lack of force when they cough infectious droplet nuclei are hardly ever expelled. \nHowever, transmission from individual children does occur [ 29-31] . Adolescents are more often infectious since \ntheir manifestations of pulmonary TB are more like those seen in adults [ 19,21]. \n   \n \n \n \nInvestigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings   ECDC  GUIDANCE  \n \n \n \n8 \n \n \n 3 Summary of current practice  and evidence \nand panel opinions on good practice  \n3.1 Triggers and scope of a TB incident investigation  \n3.1.1 Triggers for  the investigation of TB incidents affecting children \nin congregate settings  \nCurrent pra ctice , evidence and practi ce rationale  \nThe consideration to investigate a TB incident in a congregate setting should be the notification and a subsequent \nrisk assessment of any case of active TB disease in this setting. The notification of a TB incident wi ll follow the \nexisting alert and notification practices and legal requirements of the country.  \nCommon practice in incident investigations calls for a cost -effective approach for the risk assessment and to only \nconsider bacteriologically positive cases as i ndex cases and as a trigger for further investigation. From the \nassessment of current national practices it appears \u2013 despite the heterogeneity of findings-  that a more cautious \napproach is often implemented in the case of TB incidents that affect children.  The assessment showed that the \ntrigger for extensive investigations is equally divided between adult bacteriologically positive cases and children diagnosed with TB. However, when the source case is identified this can most often be attributed to an infec tious \nadult case.  \nAs young children are at an increased risk of rapid progression from TB infection to disease, the TB incident \ninvestigations are also frequently triggered by bacteriologically negative adults or children. To balance this cautious \napproach , both the high risk of children to develop TB and the cost -effectiveness of the approach should be taken \ninto consideration. An individual risk assessment should always be performed by a team of experienced clinical and public health experts, taking into consideration the characteristics of the index case and of the setting in which the \nincident occurs.  \nYoung children with TB disease are generally not considered to be infectious. They represent an event of recent \ntransmission from someone else in the near  environment. Therefore, a case of paediatric TB should always \nstimulate the initiation of both source finding and contact investigation.  \nThe expert panel decided that the following index cases should be the triggers for initiating an investigation of a TB  \nincident affecting children in a congregate setting:  \nExpert opinions  \n \n3.1.2 Persons to be investigated/ screened during the investigation of \nTB incidents affecting children in congregate settings  \nCurrent practice , evidence and practi ce rationale  \nThe \u2018source case\u2019 is the individual who brought the infection to the setting and infected others. A \u2018contact\u2019 is \nsomeone who has been exposed to a person with infectious TB, by sharing air space with, the so -called source \ncase. The probability  of being infected upon exposure increases with the duration and closeness of contact as well \nas the infectiousness of the source case. The susceptibility of the exposed individual does then determine whether \ndisease will develop after infection. The \u2018index case\u2019 is a person with suspected or confirmed TB disease, who is \ndefined as the initial case detected by the healthcare system or by the health authorities prompting a contact \ninvestigation. The index case is not necessarily the source case. For the purpose of this document, c ontacts may \nbe children or adults with evidence of prolonged and frequent exposure to the index case in a congregate setting.  \nIncident investigations can include two different types of contact investigation and in children both are undertaken, \nusually: \u2018source finding\u2019, in which the aim is to identify the source case, i.e. the case that infected the index case; \nand \u2018contact investigation\u2019, in which the aim is to identify possible contacts infected by a source case.  It should be \ntaken into consideration that the source case might have left the congregate setting, and if relevant, the \ninvestigation should also include individuals that have attended/worked in the congregate setting in the past.  \nThe nature of the type of investigation undertaken will depend on the index case. In incidents where the index \ncase is an infectious TB case, contact investigations with the aim to find infected contacts is the priority. In \nincidents where the index case is a (non -infectious) child with TB, there is a need to undertake source finding with \u2022 An adult with infectious TB working in/attending a congregate setting.  \n\u2022 A child with infectious TB attending a congregate setting.  \n\u2022 A child with non -infectious TB (any site of infection) and where no other source has been identified outside \nof the congregate setting.   \n \n \n \nECDC  GUIDANCE  Investigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings  \n \n \n9 \n \n \n the aim to find the individual who infected the child, with subsequent contact tracing around the suspected source \ncase. If the source is not found among the household contacts, the source finding investigation should be \nexpanded to congregate settings where the child could possibly have been exposed.  \nThe number of children investigated within the context of a TB incident in congregate settings appears to be larger \nthan what is usually reported for other types of a ctive case finding investigations (e.g. household contact \ninvestigations). However, these operational and logistical challenges appear to be justified given the proportion of \nchildhood TB cases attributed to outbreaks reported in the systematic review conducted in preparation of this \ndocument.  \nFrom the perspective of TB elimination, all TB cases and latently infected individuals are relevant, thus all subjects \nwith potential extensive exposure to the index case should be considered of interest and duly inv estigated. It is \nimportant to reali se \u2013 and this is clear from both the literature review and survey performed\u2013  that TB incidents \naffecting children require comprehensive investigation and should always include both contact investigation to \nidentify possible contacts infected by an infectious adult or paediatric case, and the more cumbersome exercise to \nidentify the source case of infection when the index case is a child (and the source is unknown).  \nFor these two types of investigations of TB incident s in congregate settings, the expert panel found it of relevance \nto emphasise the following:  \nExpert opinions  \n \n \n  \u2022 Contact investigation/ screening:  \nAll individuals working/attending the congregate setting should be considered. Based on  an \nindividual  risk ass essment , priority should be given to the contacts with the most extensive \nexposure to the index  case (according to the stone -in-the-pond principle,  see further 3.3.2 ) and the \nhighest risk for progression to disease (i.e. the very young children, and immuno compromised \nindividuals) . \n\u2022 Source finding:  \nAll individuals working/attending the congregate setting should be considered (if a source has not \nbeen identified outside the setting) . Based on an individual risk assessment , priority should be given \nto the indi viduals with closest contact and the highest risk of transmitting  the disease to the index \ncase (usually adults and adolescents) .  \n \n \n \nInvestigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings   ECDC  GUIDANCE  \n \n \n \n10 \n \n \n 3.2 Preparedness, planning and responsibilities  \n3.2.1 Incident management plan for TB incidents affecting children  in \ncongregate settings  \nCurrent practice , evidence and practi ce rationale  \nPreparedness and planning are of utmost importance for preventing infectious disease transmission and managing \noutbreak events when there is a need for rapid action. As the investigation  of TB incidents in congregate settings \nsuch as schools are challenged by the potentially large number of contacts, the management of such complex \ninvestigations will be greatly facilitated by having plans available. T uberculosis  incidents in congregate settings \noften generate publicity and anxiety among those affected, therefore communication preparedness is essential.  \nThe expert panel chose to focus on the essential aspects of an incident management plan which would be of \nparticular relevance to TB incid ents affecting children, so as not to repeat the full content of a regular outbreak \nmanagement plan. On the advice of the expert panel, a template for an incident management plan is proposed in \nAppendix 1. The purpose of the template is to provide a practi cal example that can be adapted to the specific \nrequirements and needs of the country in order to develop a national incident management plan.  \nExpert opinions  \n \n3.2.2 Responsibilities for initiatin g the investigation of a TB incident \naffecting children in congregate settings  \nCurrent practice , evidence and practi ce rationale  \nThe assessment of current national practices does not highlight any particular advantages regarding what level \n(local/regional/ national) holds responsibility for TB incident identification and management. Clearly assigned \nresponsibility for reacting to TB incidents should facilitate the investigation and control in the congregate setting, implementation of measures, and follow -up of cases according to existing guidelines. In several countries a central \nlevel institution remains important for national level surveillance of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings and can facilitate certain aspects of the incident management.  \nExpert opinions  \n \n  \u2022 A TB incident management plan should be written and available at national and local level bef ore a \nTB incident occurs and should include a communication plan.  A template TB incident management \nplan is propsed in Appendix 1,  which  incorporate generic components of the investigation and control \nof TB inciden ts.  \n\u2022 Any health professional diagnosing TB in a person working/attending a congregate setting for \nchildren should alert t he competent health authority having jurisdiction over the location of the \nincident, and  initiate an investigation, as defined in the national legislation.   \n \n \n \nECDC  GUIDANCE  Investigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings  \n \n \n11 \n \n \n 3.2.3 Roles and expertise in the team investigating a TB incident \naffecting children in congregate settings  \nCurrent practice , evidence and practi ce rationa le \nThe roles should be defined by national and local guidance, in order to ensure a complete coverage of all the \nincident investigation and management components.  \nExpert opinions  \n \n  The composition of the  incident management  team should be adapted to the specific situation.

There are certain aspects that are of particular im portance in investigations of \nincidents involving children that might not be included in recommendations on outbreak management in general.  \nBest practices suggest a demand for clear definitions, clear roles and responsibilities, involvement of a specialised \nteam and availability of guidelines for development and implementation of an incident management plan. They are \ncentral for successful investigation of TB incidents and outbreaks affecting children.  \nThe assessment of current national practices has highli ghted several key steps in the management of TB incidents; \nhowever studies and reports measuring the impact of such steps in terms of TB prevention and cost -effectiveness \nare lacking.  \nExpert opinions  \n \n3.3.2 Criteria for prioritisation of children to be screened for active TB \nand LTBI in TB incidents affecting chil dren in congregate settings  \nCurrent practice , evidence and practi ce rationale  \nThere has been a European consensus statement which can help to guide national practices [ 16,32]. However, a \nreview of the national guidelines and recommendations for contact screening in Europe showed that among \nexisting national guidelines, the criteria for the selecti on of contacts, the screening process, and the prescription of \npreventive treatment for LTBI differ [ 32].   \nThe principles of screening for TB infection a re the same regardless of the age of the index case and contacts. \nAfter the infectiousness of the index case is established, contacts in the context of a childhood TB incident are \ncommonly traced through what is often named the \u201cprogressive, concentric cir cles\u201d or \u201cstone- in-the-pond\u201d principle \n[33,34].  \nThe \u201cston e-in-the-pond\u201d principle in practi ce starts with screening of a restricted number of close contacts. The \ninvestigations are extended further if there is evidence of active transmission of infection. The principle gives \npriority in the assessment according to the highest risk of exposure and the susceptibility of the contact. It also \ntakes in to consideration how far to expand contact investigations by assessing whether the expected group \nprevalence of infection is similar to the observed. If the observed gro up prevalence of infection is higher than the \nexpected,  the contact investigation needs to be expanded.  TB incidents differ in size and complexity. The steps below should be considered in addition to a generic \nnational incident management plan:  \n\u2022 Verification of the alert of a potential TB incident.  \n\u2022 Early preliminary evaluation of the verified TB incident.  \n\u2022 On-site evaluation of the situation  \n\u2022 Identification  of the incident management team and assignment of responsibilities.  \n\u2022 Agreement on clear referral pathways with contact details for those to be consulted.  \n\u2022 Assessment and prioritisation of required resources  \n\u2022 Assessment of practicalities of conducting the i nvestigation (including location/s for screening).  \n\u2022 Immediate initiation of screening to ensure early detection of both LTBI and TB cases.  \n\u2022 Simultaneous contact investigation for transmission from index case and for source finding (where \nsource unknown).  \n\u2022 Prioritisation of children for screening based on risk assessment stratified by cumulative exposure and \nrisk of disease progression.  \n\u2022 Initiat ion of proactive, on -going communication with relevant stakeholders.  \n\u2022 Implementation and monitoring of control measures.  \n\u2022 Management of all active TB and LTBI cases.  \n\u2022 Systematic collection and documentation to allow evaluation and reporting  of the TB incident.   \n \n \n \nECDC  GUIDANCE  Investigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings  \n \n \n13 \n \n \n If young children are among the contacts in given TB incidents, they require a higher priority in the contact \ninvestigations compared to contacts of similar exposure due to their greater susceptibility to TB infection and high \nrisk of progression to active TB disease and, especially in children below 2 years of age, to severe or generali sed \ndisease. For this reason children below 2 years, and in some E uropean countries below 5 years, are given the \nhighest priority for rapid investigation, independent of the time of exposure to the source case; adolescents are \nalso given higher priority due to increased risk of disease [ 19-22]. These young children are also given the highest \npriority for chemoprophylaxis and preventive treatment, even before the presence/absence of infection has been \nestablished [16,17,35]. \nGeneral contact investigation and infection screening guidelines can also be used in the case of MDR TB and XDR \nTB. Expert opinions and a summary of evidence on the management of contacts of MDR TB and XDR TB patients \nare provided in another ECDC guidance document [ 36]. \nExpert opinions  \n \nThe following are criteria that can be used for prioritisation of children to be screened, these are not mutually \nexclusive.  \n3.3.3 Diagnosis of LTBI and active TB in children \nCurrent pra ctice , evidence and practi ce rationale  \nAlthough the diagnosis of LTBI and TB disease in children can be a challenge and forms a clinical continuum, it is \ncertainly feasible with the use of currently available diagnostic tools. LTBI or active TB disease sho uld be suspected \nin any child with TST and/or IGRA positive results and interpreted in light of: (i) age of the child; (ii) closeness to the index case or source case, if identified; (iii) country of origin of the child, and; (iv) previous BCG vaccination or \nprevious TST/IGRA result, and; (v) the local epidemiological situation. The use, combination and interpretation of \nthese tools and approaches to diagnose infection should be in line with prevailing national and international \nguidelines.  \nSeveral aspects are of importance in the diagnostic process. This includes clinical and radiological examinations and \nproper use of diagnostic tools (such as making use of rapid molecular methods for the confirmation of disease and for drug susceptibility testing in addi tion to smear microscopy and culture confirmation). The use of the right \nspecimens (such as gastric aspirates, broncho -alveolar lavage, or induced sputum in children below ten years of \nage) is also important for the diagnosis.  Criteria 1: Infectivity of the  index case \n\u2022 Evidence of transmission in the househol d. \n\u2022 The index case is an adult or adolescent.  \n\u2022 Presence and severity of symptoms/signs compatible with infectious respiratory TB (predictors for infectivity: Acid -fast bacilli positive (PCR -confirmed for \nM. tuberculosis ), cavitation, cough, duration of \ncough .) \nCriteria 2: Individual risk factors  for rapid progression of disease  in potential contacts:  \n\u2022 Age (children less than 5 years, particularly <2 years, have the highest risk of progression; next in \npriority are adolescents).  \n\u2022 Immunosuppression, including natural/primary (e.g. HIV), disease associated (e.g. malignant hematologic disease), or iatrogenic (TNF -alpha -inhibitors, cytotoxic agents, high -dose or long- term \ncorticosteroids).  \nCriteria 3: Risk of exposure:  \n\u2022 Through \u201cprogressive circles\u201d or \u201cstone- in-the-pond principle\u201d: Closest/longest cumulative contact to \nthe index case (re- evaluate if another source case has been identified).  \n\u2022 All children/staff exposed to the index case, especially those with prolonged and repeated exposure.  \n\u2022 Environmental factors suc h as room size and ventilation should be taken into consideration.  \n  \n \n \n \nInvestigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings   ECDC  GUIDANCE  \n \n \n \n14 \n \n \n Expert opinions  \n \n3.3.4 Management of children with active TB disease  \nCurrent practice , evidence and practi ce rationale  \nChildren affected by TB are treated according to national guidelines and taking into account WHO/international \nrecommended guidelines, regimens and directly observed treatment (DOT), as well as the European Union \nStandards for Tuberculosis Care (ESTC) [ 37]. \nExpert opinions  \n \n3.3.5 Management of children with LTBI  \nCurrent practice , evidence and practi ce rationale  \nYoung children are at increased risk of progression to TB disease if infected and, according to available evidence, constitute a group that benefits the most from chemoprophylaxis\n1 and preventive treatment [ 35]. However, there \nis no recent meta -analysis of chemoprophylaxis or preventive treatment for children in general. A Cochrane review \nfrom 2011 concluded that chemoprophylaxis and preventive treatment has the potential to play a major public \nhealth role by reducing TB incidence and mortality in HIV -infected children. There are not yet, however, enough \nstudies in the general paediatric population to provide specific guidance on duration etc. [ 38]. As some examples, \nisoniazid for 6 or 9 months is the international standard regimen. Isoniazid/rifampicin for 3 months is the most \nfrequently recommended or used alternative regimen, followed by a regimen usin g rifampicin for 4 months \n[17,39,40], but other national regimens is in pr actise or under evaluation.   \nExpert opinions and a summary of evidence on the management of contacts of MDR TB and XDR TB patients are \nprovided in another ECDC guidance document [36]. That guidance document emphasise s that the evidence for \npreventive ther apy of MDR TB and XDR TB contacts is very scarce, although for children there are indications of a \npositive effect of preventive therapy as an alternative to provide information and follow -up with careful clinical \nobservation of the contacts identified to have LTBI [36].  Active TB should be diagnosed:  \n\u2022 In line with international or national recommendations.  \n\u2022 In consultation with an expert in paediatric TB, preferably a paediatrician with TB/infectious disease \nexpertise.  \nLatent TB infection should be diagnosed:  \n\u2022 In line with internatio nal and national recommendations.  \n[Note: Currently there is varying evidence on the positive predictive value of IGRA for LTBI \ndiagnosis among children <5 years.]  \n\u2022 In consultation with an expert in paediatric TB.  \n\u2022 The intention to treat, when LTBI is diagnosed, should be a guiding principle: all infected subjects \nshould be offered appropriate therapy, unless contraindicated.  \n\u2022 An expert in paediatric TB, preferably a paediatrician with TB/infectious disease expertise  (and with \nMDR TB experience) should be consulted where the suspected source case has MDR TB.  \n\u2022 Children with active TB disease should be managed in line with international or national \nrecommendations and the Euro pean Union Standards for Tuberculosis Care.  \n\u2022 Preferably a paediatrician with TB/infectious disease expertise should supervise/ be consulted in the management of a child with active TB disease.  \n  \n \n \n \nECDC  GUIDANCE  Investigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings  \n \n \n15 \n \n \n Expert opinions  \n \n \n  Chemoprophylaxis1: \n\u2022 Chemoprophylaxis should be given to children in line with national or international guidelines.

In particular young children, especially those below  2 years of age,  and \nimmunosuppressed children should be treated.  \n\u2022 Exclude active TB disease before initiating LTBI preventive treatment.  \n\u2022 Take into account the results of drug susceptibility testing of the suspected source case.  \n\u2022 Ensure proper monitoring of  side effects and best possible support to adherence in children provided \nLTBI preventive treatment . \n\u2022 Because of lack of evidence, no opinion is provided for LTBI  preventive treatment when the \nsuspected source case has MDR TB.       \n\u2022 Educate caregivers about  relevant early symptoms and signs of TB, and the need for immediate \nmedical evaluation if symptoms occur.  \n\u2022 Educate caregivers about the increased risk of progression to disease when immunosuppressive \ntherapy or an immune compromising conditions is present in a person diagnosed with LTBI.  \n1 Chemoprophylaxis is started as soon as possible after exposure of the child, before TST/IGRA results can prove or \ndisprove infection. Chemoprophylaxis is discontinued as soon as infection is disproved. If LTBI however is confirmed (by \nTST/IGRA 8 -12 weeks after exposure) and active TB excluded (by clinical and radiological examinations), it may be \ncontinued as preventive treatment.

Basic information may be prepared in advance and in different languages \naccording to need. Communication around the incident should be provided by the responsible authority/ies as \ndefined in the specific country/region. From the assessment of current national practices it appears that \ncommunication is considered a core activity in all countrie s. The communication should provide a correct risk \ninterpretation of the event to the affected community and, where necessary, to the public at large.  \nAn explicit communication plan should be part of the national TB incident management plan. In preparatio n of \nsuch a communication plan, the general principles are outlined in the WHO outbreak communication guidelines \nfrom 2005 [ 41]. \nIt is of importance that the communication plan is prepared before an incident or outbreak takes place. This will \nensure that the communication is not provided in a state of panic, where initial rushed messages can  hamper the \nincident investigation and the continued communication with involved stakeholders and the public.  \nThe communication should follow some basic principles, in order to build trust. The basic principles that should be \nensured are to: be available,  embrace openness and transparency; and to provide early, proactive and regular \ninformation as needed or requested. As information will need to be provided to a range of stakeholders, the communication should be tailored to recipients.

Where available, this allows for the analysis of \nthe contribution of incident -associated cases to national TB notification rates. This would allow f or an evaluation of \nincident management practices and would be of value in estimating resource allocations for future incidents.  \nExpert opinions  \n \n3.5.2 Evaluation of national epidemiological impact of TB incidents \naffecting children in congregate settings  \nCurrent practice , evidence and practi ce rationale  \nBy annual analysis of surveillance data it will be possible to assess the contribution of incident related childhood TB \ncases to overall childhood TB notifications. This would allow a proper assessment of childhood TB trends and \nmonitor magnitude and frequency of outbreaks. In countries with reliable surveillance information, outbreak -\nrelated cases may represent a substantial proportion of the national burden; this information allows proper \ninterpretation of occasional spikes in childhood  TB notifications at national level.  \nExpert opinions  \n The following information or sources of data would be of value, to allow for a complete capture by \nsurveilla nce systems of information on incidents that have occurred:  \n\u2022 Document active TB cases with epidemiological links to congregate settings.  \n\u2022 Include information on: if and how the source case was identified (only for children), rationale of case finding, and t ype of setting.  \n\u2022 Link molecular typing data with epidemiological data. It should be noted that molecular typing data \nare not routinely available in all countries. In addition, molecular typing data are usually available \nmuch later than case notification da ta. \n\u2022 Include data on whether there is an epidemiological link to previous incidents involving a congregate \nsetting.  \n\u2022 Use a standardised template for the outbreak report to ensure that all relevant data are captured.  \n\u2022 Link published incident investigation reports to complement notification data.  \n\u2022 Build a national database on the characteristics of occurring incidents.  \n \nEvaluation of the national impact of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings can be \naccomplished by:  \n\u2022 Estimating the associated TB disease burden.  \n\u2022 Estimating the associated LTBI burden.  \nAssociated factors might also be examined:  \n\u2022 The outcome of chemoprophylaxis and preventive treatment given, taking into consideration that the level of compliance generally achieved can vary.  \n\u2022 Resources required to respond to the incidents.  \nSystematically collecting information on TB incidents affords the opportunity to evaluate/assess that \nadequate responses are in place, and to assess lessons learned, in order to improve the investigation and \nmanagement of future inci dents.  \n  \n \n \n \nECDC  GUIDANCE  Investigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings  \n \n \n19 \n \n \n 3.5.3 Documentation and reporting of TB incidents and outbreaks \naffecting children in congregate settings  \nCurrent practice , evidence and practi ce rationale  \nAs shown from the assessment of current national practices, there is an underreporting of outbreaks and especially \nof incidents where no additional TB cases were identified, and thus confirmed not to be real outbreaks, and \ntherefore there are missed opportunities to learn from previous investigations.  \nExpert opinions  \n \n  To encourage and promot e sharing of best practices, the expert panel identified the following actions for \ndocumentation and reporting to professional audiences:  \n\u2022 Public health and clinical practitioners should be encouraged and supported to publish their work related to outbreak investigations.  \n\u2022 Outbreaks should be documented and reported or published in peer -reviewed journals, bulletins or \nother professional fora to allow for wide dissemination of experiences and outcomes.  \n\u2022 Outbreak investigation reports should be used as training material for health practitioners.  \n  \n \n \n \nInvestigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings   ECDC  GUIDANCE  \n \n \n \n20 \n \n \n 4 Future research needs  \nThere is a need for further research in this area. The following research priorities were identified by ECDC and the \nexpert panel:  \n\u2022 To define the real burden of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings  \n\u2022 To develop new, more reliable diagnostic methods to identify LTBI and TB disease, especially in very young \nchildren  \n\u2022 To develop a better tool that would allow the identification of infected persons at risk of progressing to TB disease  \n\u2022 To study the cost effectiveness of different strategies for contact investigation  \n\u2022 To study the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis and preventive treatment  \n\u2022 To build evidence on how to manage child contacts to MDR TB patients, includi ng effectiveness of \nchemoprophylaxis and preventive treatment, and effectiveness of specific drug regimens.   \n \n \n \nECDC  GUIDANCE  Investigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings  \n \n \n21 \n \n \n References  \n1.

The template is not intended to be a compreh ensive and definitive incident management plan, but to reflect \nthe key issues, without expanding on all potential considerations, to be taken into account.  \nFor each chapter/element of the template, the rationale is given explaining in brief what the purpose of each \nchapter/element is. This provides the authors of the national IMPs with a general idea of what should be covered \nfor each element/section of the IMP.  \nThe creation of a national IMP should take into consideration some basic concepts. The plan shou ld: \n\u2022 Emphasise the importance of timely and efficient investigation to ensure early detection of both LTBI and TB cases, particularly in young children.  \n\u2022 Provide a plan for allocation/ prioritisation of resources to the TB incident/ congregate setting. \n\u2022 Give clear allocation of responsibilities within the TB incident team and between health authorities.  \n\u2022 Specify the expertise needed within the TB incident team.  \n\u2022 Outline when there is a need for consultation of regional/national health authorities.  \n\u2022 Recommend a vi sit to the congregate setting.  \n\u2022 Recommend a systematic risk assessment of children (i.e. taking into account degree of exposure and risk \nfor progression to TB disease).  \n\u2022 Provide a plan for the steps included in the investigation and control of the TB inciden t should be managed.  \n\u2022 Provide a plan for early, transparent and comprehensive communication.  \n\u2022 Provide a plan for systematic collection and documentation of information on the TB incident.  \nElements to cover in a TB incident management plan  \n1 Objective of IMP  \nThe rationale for this chapter is to set the specific objective the incident management plan has, namely to be specific for TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings. The purpose of the IMP is to ensure timely and \nefficient investigation to detect both LTBI and TB cases in order to treat and follow up appropriately, and to stop \nfurther spread of infection during a TB incident affecting children in a congregate setting.  \n2 Implementation of IMP  \nThe rationale for this chapter is to outline the pro cess by which the IMP should be practically implemented and to \nprovide details related to how to monitor the progress of the implementation of the IMP.  \n3 Definition of incident  \nThe rationale for this chapter is to provide a specific definition of a TB inci dent affecting children in congregate \nsettings.  \n4 Roles and responsibilities  \nThe rationale for this chapter is to specify the expertise needed within the TB incident team and to clearly allocate \nresponsibilities within the TB incident team and between heal th authorities for the management of TB incidents \naffecting children in congregate settings. The description of roles and responsibilities should follow those of the national and regional/local jurisdiction for which the IMP is written. Preferably a detail ed list of roles and the \ncorresponding responsibilities should be described. General functions/expertise which are suggested to be available/ensured are outlined in Chapter 3.2.3 of this guidance document.   \n \n \n \nInvestigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings   ECDC  GUIDANCE  \n \n \n \n24 \n \n \n 5 Steps in incident investigation and control  \nThe rationale for this chapter is to establish the chronological order of procedures for the investigation and control \nof a TB incident affecting children in congregate settings. For each subheading, the intention is to describe the \nimportance of each element and to provide the details of how each procedure should be managed according to the \nnational guidelines, as well as taking into account international guidelines, standards and best practices. Below is a \nsuggestion for the chronological order of procedures.  The steps outlined in Chapter 3.3.1 of this guidance \ndocument may prove useful when determining which elements to be covered here.    \n\u2022 Source finding  \n\u2022 Contact investigation  \n\u2022 Identification of LTBI and TB cases  \n\u2212 Screening and diagnosis of cases with LTBI  \n\u2212 Screening and diagnosis of cases with TB disease  \n\u2022 Individual risk assessments  \n\u2022 Implementation of control measures  \n\u2212 Exclusion of infectious cases from the setting  \n\u2212 Treatment of active TB cases  \n\u2212 Chemotherapy/preventive therapy to LTBI cases  \n6 Communication  \nThe ra tionale for this chapter is to provide details of communication requirements in a TB incident in order to \nprovide early, transparent and comprehensive communication to all relevant stakeholders affected by the actions taken in the congregate setting.  \n7 Tra ining  \nThe rationale for this chapter is to fully provide a scheme for the development of educational knowledge for all \nhealth care workers and stakeholders involved in the investigation of TB incidents affecting children in congregate \nsettings.  \n8 Documentation and evaluation  \nThe rationale for this chapter is to provide a description of requirements for the documentation, monitoring and \nreporting of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings, as well as the process to evaluate the respon se \nconnected to the investigations of these TB incidents and to implement lessons learned.  \n\u2022 Document, monitor and report on the results  \n\u2022 Evaluate effectiveness of procedures and process  \n\u2022 Implement lessons learned.  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nECDC  GUIDANCE  Investigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings  \n \n \n25 \n \n \n Appendix II  \nSummary of expert opinions  \nArea/ Topic  Expert opinion  \n3.1.1 Triggers for the \ninvestigation of TB \nincidents affecting children in congregate \nsettings  \u2022 An adult with infectious TB working in/attending a congregate setting.  \n\u2022 A child with infectious TB attending a congregate setting.  \n\u2022 A child with non -infectious TB (any site of infection) and where no other source has been identified \noutside of the congregate setting.  \n3.1.2 Persons to be \ninvestigated/ screened \nduring the i nvestigation \nof TB incidents affecting \nchildren in congregate settings  Contact investigation/ screening:  \nAll individuals working/attending the congregate setting should be considered. Based on an individual risk assessment, priority should be given to the contacts with the most extensive exposure to the \nindex case (according to the stone -in-the-pond principle, see  3.3.2) and the highest risk for \nprogression to disease (i.e. the very young children, and immunocompromised individuals).  \nSource finding:   \nAll individuals working/attending the congregate setting should be considered (if a source has not \nbeen identified outside the setting). Based on an individual risk assessment, priority should be given \nto the individuals with closest contact and the highest ris k of transmitting the disease to the index \ncase (usually adults and adolescents).  \n3.2.1 Incident \nmanagement plan for \nTB incidents affecting \nchildren in congregate \nsettings  A TB incident management plan should be written and available at national and local  level before a TB \nincident occurs and should include a communication plan.  A template TB incident management plan is \npropsed in Appendix 1, which incorporate s generic components of the investigation and control of TB \nincidents.  \n3.2.2 Responsibilities \nfor initiating the \ninvestigation of a TB \nincident affecting \nchildren in congregate \nsettings  Any health professional diagnosing TB in a person working/attending a congregate setting for children \nshould alert the competent health authority having jurisdiction o ver the location of the incident, and \ninitiate an investigation, as defined in the national legislation.  \n3.2.3 Roles and \nexpertise in the team \ninvestigating a TB \nincident affecting \nchildren in congregate \nsettings  The composition of the incident management  team should be adapted to the specific situation. The \nfollowing experts should always be available either within the TB incident team or by way of consultation/ information:  \nCore members of the TB incident team:  \n\u2022 Specialist in public health (TB/ infectio us disease), usually of the competent health authority  \n\u2022 Consultant paediatric expertise (TB/ infectious disease expertise)  \n\u2022 Consultant adult expertise (TB/pulmonology/infectious disease expertise)  \n\u2022 TB Nurse/ (or a nurse with expertise in TB contact inve stigation)  \nPeople to be consulted/informed should include:  \n\u2022 Consultant microbiology expertise  \n\u2022 Communication expertise/manager/spokesperson (for large incident investigations in particular)  \n\u2022 Surveillance expertise/epidemiology expertise  \n\u2022 Representative from the congregate setting  \n\u2022 Municipality representative  \n\u2022 Others as may be appropriate to the particular incident  \n3.3.1 Steps to consider \nin the investigation and \ncontrol of a TB incident \naffecting children in \ncongregate settings  TB incidents differ in  size and complexity. The steps below should be considered in addition to a generic \nnational incident management plan:  \n\u2022 Verification of the alert of a potential TB incident.  \n\u2022 Early preliminary evaluation of the verified TB incident.  \n\u2022 On-site evaluation  of the situation  \n\u2022 Identification of the incident management team and assignment of responsibilities.  \n\u2022 Agreement on clear referral pathways with contact details for those to be consulted.  \n\u2022 Assessment and prioritisation of required resources  \n\u2022 Assessme nt of practicalities of conducting the investigation (including location/s for screening).  \n\u2022 Immediate initiation of screening to ensure early detection of both LTBI and TB cases.  \n\u2022 Simultaneous contact investigation for transmission from index case and for source finding (where source unknown).  \n\u2022 Prioritisation of children for screening based on risk assessment stratified by cumulative exposure \nand risk of disease progression.  \n\u2022 Initiation of proactive, on -going communication with relevant stakeholders.  \n\u2022 Implementation and monitoring of control measures.  \n\u2022 Management of all active TB and LTBI cases.  \n\u2022 Systematic collection and documentation to allow evaluation and reporting of the TB incident.   \n \n \n \nInvestigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings   ECDC  GUIDANCE  \n \n \n \n26 \n \n \n Area/ Topic  Expert opinion  \n3.3.2 Criteria for \nprioritisation of children \nto be screened  for \nactive TB and LTBI in TB \nincidents affecting children in congregate \nsettings  The following are criteria that can be used for prioritisation of children to be screened, these are not \nmutually exclusive.  \nCriteria 1: Infectivity of the index case  \n\u2022 Evidence of transmission in the household.  \n\u2022 The index case is an adult or adolescent.  \n\u2022 Presence and severity of symptoms/signs compatible with infectious respiratory TB (predictors for infectivity: Acid -fast bacilli positive (PCR -confirmed for M. tubercu losis), cavitation, cough, \nduration of cough.)  \nCriteria 2: Individual risk factors for rapid progression of disease in potential contacts:  \n\u2022 Age (children less than 5 years, particularly <2 years, have the highest risk of progression; next \nin priority are adolescents).  \n\u2022 Immunosuppression, including natural/primary (e.g. HIV), disease associated (e.g. malignant \nhematologic disease), or iatrogenic (TNF -alpha-inhibitors, cytotoxic agents, high -dose or long -\nterm corticosteroids).  \nCriteria 3: Risk of exposure:  \n\u2022 Through \u201cprogressive circles\u201d or \u201cstone -in-the-pond principle\u201d: Closest/longest cumulative contact \nto the index case (re- evaluate if another source case has been identified).  \n\u2022 All children/staff exposed to the index case, especially those with prolonge d and repeated \nexposure.  \n\u2022 Environmental factors such as room size and ventilation should be taken into consideration.  \n3.3.3 Diagnosis of LTBI \nand active TB in \nchildren  Active TB should be diagnosed:  \n\u2022 In line with international or national recommendations.  \n\u2022 In consultation with an expert in paediatric TB, preferably a paediatrician with TB/infectious disease \nexpertise.  \nLatent TB infection should be diagnosed:  \n\u2022 In line with international and national recommendations.  \n   [Note: Currently there is varying evidence on the positive predictive value of IGRA for LTBI \ndiagnosis among children <5 years.]  \n\u2022 In consultation with an expert in paediatric TB.  \n\u2022 The intentio n to treat, when LTBI is diagnosed, should be a guiding principle: all infected subjects \nshould be offered appropriate therapy, unless contraindicated.  \n\u2022 An expert in paediatric TB, preferably a paediatrician with TB/infectious disease expertise (and with  \nMDR TB experience) should be consulted where the suspected source case has MDR TB.  \n3.3.4 Management of \nchildren with active TB disease  \u2022 Children with active TB disease should be managed in line with international or national \nrecommendations and the Euro pean Union Standards for Tuberculosis Care.  \n\u2022 Preferably a paediatrician with TB/infectious disease expertise should supervise/ be consulted in the \nmanagement of a child with active TB disease.  \n3.3.5 Management of \nchildren with LTBI  Chemoprophylaxis1: \n\u2022 Chemoprophylaxis should be given to children in line with national or international guidelines. In \nparticular young children, especially those below 2 years of age, and immunosuppressed children \nshould be treated.  \n\u2022 Exclude active TB disease before initiat ing chemoprophylaxis.  \n\u2022 Take into account the results of drug susceptibility testing of the suspected source case.  \n\u2022 Ensure proper monitoring of side effects and best possible support to adherence in children \nprovided chemoprophylaxis.  \n\u2022 Educate caregive rs about relevant early symptoms and signs of TB, and the need for immediate \nmedical evaluation if symptoms occur.  \n\u2022 Because of lack of evidence, no opinion is provided for the use of chemoprophylaxis when the suspected source case has MDR TB.  \nLTBI preven tive treatment1: \n\u2022 Preventive treatment should be given to children in line with national or international \nrecommendations. In particular young children, especially those below 2 years of age, and \nimmunosuppressed children should be treated.  \n\u2022 Exclude act ive TB disease before initiating LTBI preventive treatment.  \n\u2022 Take into account the results of drug susceptibility testing of the suspected source case.  \n\u2022 Ensure proper monitoring of side effects and best possible support to adherence in children \nprovided LTBI preventive treatment. \n\u2022 Because of lack of evidence, no opinion is provided for LTBI preventive treatment when the suspected source case has MDR TB.       \n\u2022 Educate caregivers about relevant early symptoms and signs of TB, and the need for immediate \nmedical evaluation if symptoms occur.  \n\u2022 Educate caregivers about the increased risk of progression to disease when immunosuppressive \ntherapy or an immune compromising conditions is present in a person diagnosed with LTBI.  \n \n1 Chemoprophylaxis is started as s oon as possible after exposure of the child, before TST/IGRA results \ncan prove or disprove infection. Chemoprophylaxis is discontinued as soon as infection is disproved. If \nLTBI however is confirmed (by TST/IGRA 8 -12 weeks after exposure) and active TB exc luded (by \nclinical and radiological examinations), it may be continued as preventive treatment. (The terms \nprimary prophylaxis, primary prophylactic treatment and window prophylaxis are also used for the same \nconcept of what we in this document refer to as  chemoprophylaxis.   \n \n \n \nECDC  GUIDANCE  Investigation and control of TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings  \n \n \n27 \n \n \n Area/ Topic  Expert opinion  \n3.4.1 Key requirements \nfor communication \naround a TB incident affecting children in \ncongregate settings  Apart from what is included in the general outbreak communication approach of the WHO outbreak \ncommunication guidelines, the expert panel expressed the need to specify certain key considerations \nfor TB incidents affecting children in congregate settings:  \n \nTo whom:  \nStakeholders who should always be communicated with:  \n\u2022 Parents and guardians.  \n\u2022 Representatives, managers, and staff members of the congregate setting.  \n\u2022 All adult and child contacts and the index/ source case, if identified.  \n\u2022 All relevant health practitioners.  \n\u2022 Other relevant authorities.  \nStakeholders who should be communicated with as needed:  \n\u2022 Media/general public.  \n\u2022 Other groups that require consideration (such as other professional groups, other child \ncongregate settings etc.).  \n \nHow: \n\u2022 Explain to the index case or parents/ guardians of the index case (as appropriate) what needs to \nhappen.  \n\u2022 Provide information/advic e material for the parents/guardians. Before screening, written consent of \nthe parents/guardians should be obtained.  \n\u2022 Provide media briefings/statements/interviews as required.  \n\u2022 Have face to face meetings with parents/carers, students, as well as staff and management from \nthe congregate setting, as needed.  \n\u2022 Provide detailed written information to the stakeholders in the congregate setting on what will happen.  \n\u2022 Provide written updates for stakeholders in the congregate setting on the process and progres s of \nthe investigation.  \n\u2022 Consider the development of web and social media material.  \n\u2022 Consider a dedicated helpline.  \n\u2022 Provide contact details of all stakeholders in the congregate setting for further information.  \n\u2022 Develop written information material on  TB. \n \nContent:  \n\u2022 Explanation of TB infection and TB disease.  \n\u2022 Explanation of what is being done why, where, when, how and by whom.  \n\u2022 Basic information on investigation principles, information on planning of investigation (e.g. process of risk assessment,  screening, preventive treatment etc.). It is helpful to include a set of Frequently \nAsked Questions.  \n\u2022 Importance of patient confidentiality and support.  \n\u2022 Explanation/ reassurance regarding concerns related to TB infectivity/ risk.  \n3.5.1 Capturing of \ninformation on \nincidents/ outbreaks \naffecting children in \ncongregate settings in \n(national) TB \nsurveillance systems  The following information or sources of data would be of value, to allow for a complete capture by \nsurveillance systems of information on incidents that have occurred:  \n\u2022 Document active TB cases with epidemiological links to congregate settings.  \n\u2022 Include information on: if and how the source case was identified (only for children), rationale of \ncase finding, and type of setting.  \n\u2022 Link mo lecular typing data with epidemiological data. It should be noted that molecular typing data \nare not routinely available in all countries. In addition, molecular typing data are usually available \nmuch later than case notification data.  \n\u2022 Include data on wh ether there is an epidemiological link to previous incidents involving a \ncongregate setting.  \n\u2022 Use a standardised template for the outbreak report to ensure that all relevant data are captured.  \n\u2022 Link published incident investigation reports to complement  notification data.  \n\u2022 Build a national database on the characteristics of occurring incidents.  \n3.5.2 Evaluation of \nnational epidemiological \nimpact of TB incidents \naffecting children in \ncongregate settings  Evaluation of the national impact of TB incidents  affecting children in congregate settings can be \naccomplished by:  \n\u2022 Estimating the associated TB disease burden.  \n\u2022 Estimating the associated LTBI burden.  \n \nAssociated factors might also be examined:  \n\u2022 The outcome of chemoprophylaxis and preventive treatm ent given, taking into consideration that \nthe level of compliance generally achieved can vary.  \n\u2022 Resources required to respond to the incidents.  \n \nSystematically collecting information on TB incidents affords the opportunity to evaluate/assess that adequate  responses are in place, and to assess lessons learned, in order to improve the investigation \nand management of future incidents.  \n3.5.3 Documentation \nand reporting of TB incidents and outbreaks \naffecting children in \ncongregate settings  To encourage and pr omote sharing of best practices, the expert panel identified the following actions \nfor documentation and reporting to professional audiences:  \n\u2022 Public health and clinical practitioners should be encouraged and supported to publish their work \nrelated to outbreak investigations.  \n\u2022 Outbreaks should be documented and reported or published in peer -reviewed journals, bulletins or \nother professional fora to allow for wide dissemination of experiences and outcomes.  \n\u2022 Outbreak investigation reports should be used a s training material for health practitioners.  \n \n ", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
