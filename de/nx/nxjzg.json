Shea butter contains a high concentration of vitamins A, E, and F, which work together to nourish and moisturise the skin. Its fatty acids also help to protect the skin's natural oils and improve its elasticity. Shea butter is particularly beneficial for dry, sensitive, or ageing skin as it can help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It is also a great ingredient for those with eczema, psoriasis, or other skin conditions, as it can soothe and heal irritated skin. Overall, shea butter is a fantastic natural option for a healthy, hydrated, and glowing skin.\nAdansonia digitata oil (baobab oil)\nThe baobab is a mythical tree, which represents life and fertility within African tribal tales. The oil produced by cold pressing its seeds, rich in unsaturated fatty acids and polyphenols, provides multiple benefits: healing, regeneration, nourishing, moisturizing, softening, soothing, and anti-oxidant.\nMoringa oleifera seed oil (moringa oil)\nNicknamed in India \"the tree of miracles\" and in Africa \"nebeday\", the tree that never dies, the moringa is appreciated for its protective, repairing and healing properties. It brings an immediate feeling of comfort, gives radiance to the skin, and strengthens the hydrolipidic film.\nAloe barbadensis leaf juice (aloe vera leaf juice)\nAloe vera contains both vitamins C and E, both of which are known to be vital for healthy skin and also help to improve natural firmness, leaving your skin soft, supple and hydrated. It is also well respected for its application as a moisturizing agent. It contains vitamin B complex, folic acid, vitamin C and carotene (a precursor of vitamin A).\nEuphorbia cerifera cera (candelilla wax)\nCandelilla wax is a wax derived from the leaves of the small Candelilla shrub native to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. To protect themselves from water loss, these plants release a wax coating which provides strong protective and film-forming properties (it helps to retain hydration) for the skin. It is considered to have a strong smoothing effect and balances the skin\u2019s lipid content.\nBenzyl alcohol\nAn antimicrobial preservative and solvent. One of the few preservatives allowed in organic products. It is naturally present in apricots, almonds, apples, asparagus, etc.\nHelianthus annuus seed oil (sunflower seed oil)\nSunflower seed oil is a lightweight oil that is extremely rich in Vitamin E. This oil is known for its moisture retention and skin-softening capabilities. It doesn\u2019t leave behind an oily residue and it also helps in forming a natural barrier on the outermost layer of the skin in order to protect it from damage. The presence of antioxidants like Vitamin A, Vitamin C and Vitamin E in sunflower seed oil makes it an excellent anti-ageing ingredient because it manages to protect the skin from free radical damage as well as sun damage.\nCarrageenan\nCarrageenan is a soluble fibre extracted from the red algae Chondrus crispus. It is used as an all-natural and organic thickening, gelling and stabilizing agent.\nGlycerin\nIt is a natural moistening additive, which maintains the moisture content of the skin or formula itself. Its moisturizing and softening effects one from its ability to capture water molecules and lock them in the cells of the epidermis. It is found in its natural state in cherries, but also in all-natural fats like those of the skin.\nGlucose\nGlucose is a humectant: it maintains the water content in the packaging and on the skin. It is used as a flavouring agent in skincare, moisturising and conditioning agent. It is thus an ally for dry skin.\nRosmarinus officinalis leaf oil (rosemary essential oil)\nRosemary is considered a powerful natural antioxidant, thanks to the phenolic diterpenes that it contains. Rosemary is also known to provide anti-inflammatory action, and it has energetic and invigorating properties. The rosemary essential oil contains a high concentration in pinene, canfene and cynene, which makes it a great antiseptic.\nDehydroacetic acid\nUsed as an antimicrobial and fungicide preservative.\nParfum\nThis is the official name of naticide, a conservative present in the (organic) aloe vera gel used in our formula. This is not a perfume but it is officially registered as such because it is also a perfuming composition. We do not use any fragrance in any of our products.\nCitric acid\nExisting in a variety of fruits and vegetables like lemons, limes, oranges, tangerines and blackberries, it is used in cosmetics and personal care products to adjust their ph balance, inhibit tyrosinase to even out the skin tone and sometimes to impart a lemon-like fragrance to a product.\nSodium benzoate\nA salt of benzoic acid found naturally in cranberries, prunes, plums, cinnamon, ripe cloves, and apples and used as a preservative in cosmetics and personal care product formulas as a fragrance ingredient, masking ingredient, anti-corrosive agent, and most frequently, as a preservative.\nPotassium sorbate\nA mild preservative being used in cosmetic and skincare formulas as a paraben alternative to prevent or retard the growth of microorganisms and protect products from spoiling, it is developed from sorbic acid, which is naturally found in the berries of the mountain ash tree.", "language": null, "image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b36504036099bdbd96b2f5f/5b36591603ce647544068f33/61d6c285d10906787eec2ca3/1673976514639/BYEBYE_TOP.jpg?format=1500w", "pagetype": "product", "links": ["/", "/cart", "/search", "/journal-design-arts-nature-skincare", "/stockists-cosmydor-organic-skincare", "/virtuous-organic-cosmetics", "/why-cosmydor-organic-skincare", "/more-information-cosmydor-organic-skincare", "/shop", "/organic-intense-skincare", "/organic-essential-skincare", "/organic-deep-skincare", "/organic-precious-basics", "/subscription-boxes", "/gift-ideas", "/special-edition-grems", "https://www.cosmydor.boutique/", "https://www.cosmydor.co.uk/", "https://www.cosmydor.store/", "https://es.cosmydor.paris", "https://it.cosmydor.paris", "https://de.cosmydor.paris", "https://www.cosmydor.mx", "http://instagram.com/cosmydor", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/cosmydor/", "/cart", "/about-cosmydor-organic-skincare", "/virtuous-organic-cosmetics", "/why-cosmydor-organic-skincare", "/more-information-cosmydor-organic-skincare", "/shop-organic-skincare", "/shop", "/organic-intense-skincare", "/organic-essential-skincare", "/organic-deep-skincare", "/organic-precious-basics", "/subscription-boxes", "/gift-ideas", "/special-edition-grems", "/journal-design-arts-nature-skincare", "/stockists-cosmydor-organic-skincare", "/en-euro", "https://www.cosmydor.boutique/", "https://www.cosmydor.co.uk/", "https://www.cosmydor.store/", "https://es.cosmydor.paris", "https://it.cosmydor.paris", "https://de.cosmydor.paris", "https://www.cosmydor.mx", "/", "/shop", "/shop/bye-bye-make-up-removal-baume-balm", "/shop/grand-baume-tonic-balm-organic-skincare", "/shop/baume-levres-kiss", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosmydor.paris%2Fshop%2Fbye-bye-make-up-removal-baume-balm", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosmydor.paris%2Fshop%2Fbye-bye-make-up-removal-baume-balm&text=A+maximum+efficiency+undiluted+organic-certified+and+vegan+make-up+removal+balm+containing+94.14%25+...", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=Cosmydor&summary=A+maximum+efficiency+undiluted+organic-certified+and+vegan+make-up+removal+balm+containing+94.14%25+...&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosmydor.paris%2Fshop%2Fbye-bye-make-up-removal-baume-balm", "https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosmydor.paris%2Fshop%2Fbye-bye-make-up-removal-baume-balm", "https://www.tumblr.com/share/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosmydor.paris%2Fshop%2Fbye-bye-make-up-removal-baume-balm", "https://de.cosmydor.paris/journal-design-arts-nature-skincare/shea-butter-in-west-africa", "https://de.cosmydor.paris/journal-design-arts-nature-skincare/shea-butter-in-west-africa", "/shop/petit-baume-rescue-balm-organic-skincare", "/shop/c4-hydrating-organic-facial-scrub-with-pink-clay-almond-powder", "/shop/e1-essential-care-vanilla-ultra-moisturising-regenerating-face-cream", "/shop/eye-contour-serum-hamamelis", "/shop/c5-anti-wrinkle-organic-cream-prickly-pear-vegetable-oil-ho-wood-essential-oil", "http://instagram.com/cosmydor", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/cosmydor/", "/contact-us-newsletter", "/newsletter", "/terms-and-conditions", "/faq", "/about/more-information-cosmydor-organic-skincare", "tel:+44 (0)203 582 33 18", "mailto:customer@cosmydor.paris"]}
