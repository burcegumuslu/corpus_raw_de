ASPS arises mainly in children and young adults and can migrate (metastasize) into other parts of the body, typically thelungsand thebrain.ASPS is asarcoma, and that indicates that this cancer initially arises from tissue of embryonic mesenchymal origin. (The fertilized egg divides and redivides forming a sphere. Early in embryogenesis, dimples appear in the poles of the sphere and burrow through the sphere forming an inner passage that will ultimately form the gut. Malignancies arising from cells that were originally part of the outer layer of the sphere and those that were part of the embryonic tunnel are termed carcinomas; malignancies arising from the cells between the outer layer and the inner burrow are termed sarcomas.) Typically, ASPS arises in muscles and deepsoft tissueof the thigh or the leg (lower extremities), but can also appear in the upper extremities (hands, neck, and head). While ASPS is a soft tissue sarcoma, it can also spread and grow inside the bones.Chromosomal analysis of ASPS shows thebreaking and joining of two chromosomesin the tumor cells. The termalveolarcomes from the microscopic pattern, visible during the analysis of slides of ASPS under the microscope inhistopathology. The tumor cells seem to be arranged in the same pattern as the cells of the small air sacks (alveoli) in the lungs. However, this is just a structural similarity. ASPS was first described and characterized in 1952. A piece of chromosome X breaks and is joined tochromosome 17.This translocation creates a fusion between two genes namedASPLandTFE3, which results in the formation of an aberrant protein (termedfusion protein) that is not found in normal cells.\nIntermediate magnificationmicrographof analveolar soft part sarcoma, commonly abbreviatedASPS.H&E stain. The images show characteristic features of ASPS: An alveolar/nested architecture. Cells with: Abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. An eccentric nucleus. Calcification.Irritation fibroma is an exophytic soft tissue mass in the oral mucosa. Indeed, it is not a real neoplasm but a focal hyperplasia of fibrous connective tissue induced by local trauma or chronic irritation. An earlier population-based epidemiological analysis showed that irritation fibroma was the second common benign oral lesion in Caucasians over 35 years of age . The predilection sites were the buccal mucosa, labial and lingual surfaces. It also revealed that there was no prominent difference in the incidence rate between the sexes. However, data may vary from country to country regarding the occurrence of oral diseases in subsequent retrospective studies.A 53-year-old man was referred to the Dermatology Clinic with a 2-year history of an exophytic lesion on the tip of his tongue. He did not accept any treatment since the lesion had no subjective symptoms. The lesion developed slowly and showed no notable change in size until this visit. The patient was systemically healthy, but he had a long history of smoking for almost 30 years and at least 20 cigarettes per day. In addition, he denied any history of trauma in his oral cavity. The lesion showed a well-defined nodule with approximate 0.5 cm diameter on the tip of the tongue. The nodule was firm and presented a color resembling normal mucosa. The lesion was resected completely under local anaesthesia. The tissue sample of the lesion was subjected to histopathological examination. Histological features showed hyperkeratosis, hyperplasia of epidermis, proliferation of fibroblasts and hyaline degeneration in partial hyperplastic collagen. We observed vascular dilatation and proliferation within the hyperplastic fibrous connective tissue in the dermis and no infiltration of inflammatory cells\nHydroxychloroquine with or without Azithromycin in Mild-to-Moderate Covid-19\nStatus of Patients on Day 15. The primary outcome was clinical status evaluated at 15 days according to a seven-level ordinal scale. The scores on the scale were defined as follows: a score of 1 indicated not hospitalized with no limitations on activities; 2, not hospitalized but with limitations on activities; 3, hospitalized and not receiving supplemental oxygen; 4, hospitalized and receiving supplemental oxygen; 5, hospitalized and receiving oxygen supplementation administered by a high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive ventilation; 6, hospitalized and receiving mechanical ventilation; and 7, death. The percentages shown have been rounded to whole numbers.Distribution of the Ordinal-Scale Results over Time. Shown is the course of ordinal-scale results as assessed over the time since randomization. However, not all levels of the seven-level scale are shown. Because data on activity limitation were not available on a daily basis for outpatients, levels 1 and 2 (i.e., the levels for patients who were not hospitalized and had no limitations on activities and for those who were not hospitalized but who had limitations on activities, respectively) were combined (equivalent to the six-level scale described in the Methods section). Thus, in this figure, levels 1 and 2 indicate not hospitalized. A total of 36 patients were discharged after a 1-day hospital stay (7 patients who had been assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, 8 in the hydroxychloroquine-alone group, and 21 in the control group). Missing data are shown at the bottom of the graphs.DiscussionIn this open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involving hospitalized patients with confirmed mild-to-moderate Covid-19, a 7-day course of hydroxychloroquine either with azithromycin or alone did not result in better clinical outcomes as measured by a seven-level ordinal scale at 15 days. There was also no effect on any of the secondary outcomes. Occurrence of any adverse event, elevation ofliver-enzyme levels, and prolongation of the QTc interval was more frequent in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin or hydroxychloroquine alone than in those receiving neither agent.The prescription of short courses (<28 days) of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in the United States increased almost 2000% between March 21, 2019, and March 21, 2020, with a subsequent decrease. In Brazil, hydroxychloroquine has been formally recommended for the treatment of Covid-19 by the Ministry of Health since March 25, 2020, for severe cases and since May 20, 2020, for mild cases. However, no clinical benefit has been observed to date in randomized, controlled trials evaluating hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of Covid-19. In addition, higher doses of chloroquine (600 mg twice daily for 10 days) were possibly associated with higher mortality. Our trial enrolled patients with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 who were receiving no more than 4 liters per minute of supplemental oxygen. Hydroxychloroquine was administered relatively early after symptom onset (median, 7 days), which is earlier than the median time from symptom onset to treatment in a trial of remdesivir treatment for Covid-19. Furthermore, the addition of azithromycin did not improve outcomes as had been suggested by observational case series.Der Nutzen implantierbarer Defibrillatorsysteme zur Pr\u00e4vention des pl\u00f6tzlichen Herztods ist durch zahlreiche randomisierte Studien belegt. In Form des vollst\u00e4ndig subkutan implantierbaren Kardioverter-Defibrillator-Systems (S-ICD) besteht die Option, einen entsprechenden Schutz zu gew\u00e4hrleisten und gleichzeitig die mit der transven\u00f6s implantierten Elektrode assoziierten Langzeitkomplikationen wie systemische Infektionen und Elektrodendysfunktion zu vermeiden. Mittlerweile ist die Sicherheit und Effektivit\u00e4t des S-ICD durch Ergebnisse gro\u00dfer Registerstudien untermauert worden. Empfehlungen wurden, basierend auf der fehlenden M\u00f6glichkeit zur ventrikul\u00e4ren Stimulation, erstmals in die aktuellen Leitlinien aufgenommen. Perspektivisch wird die Problematik der durch Oversensing bedingten inad\u00e4quaten Schockabgaben mittels erweiterter Screening-Methoden und neuer Detektionsalgorithmen wahrscheinlich noch besser kontrolliert werden k\u00f6nnen. Au\u00dferdem scheint durch eine Kombination aus subkutanem ICD und LCP (\u201eleadless cardiac pacer\u201c) in Zukunft die Kombination antibradykarder und antitachykarder ventrikul\u00e4rer Stimulation realistisch.\nVektoren zur Wahrnehmung (wei\u00df).

Die Elektrode mit 2Wahrnehmungspolen und einer dazwischen liegenden Schockwendel wird anschlie\u00dfend in 2Schritten zun\u00e4chst bis zum Xiphoid und dann meist parasternal links oder, je nach Herzkonfiguration und -lage, alternativ auch rechts parasternal subkutan  bis ungef\u00e4hr zum Beginn des Manubriums getunnelt, bevor sie mit dem Aggregat verbunden wird. Da anatomische Strukturen als Orientierung bei der Implantation verwendet werden, kann intraoperativ auf eine r\u00f6ntgenmorphologische Bildgebung verzichtet werden, wobei ein pr\u00e4operatives R\u00f6ntgenbild zur Bestimmung der Herzlage und zur Operationsplanung Standard sein sollte.Implantation von Transven\u00f6sen Defibrillatoren (ICDs)Was ist ein ICD (automatischer Implantierbarer Cardioverter-Defibrillator?Neben langsamen (bradykarden) Herzrhythmusst\u00f6rungen gibt es auch schnelle (tachykarde) Herzrhythmusst\u00f6rungen (Kammertachykardien, Kammerflimmern), die unbehandelt zu einem Herz-Kreislaufstillstand (\u201epl\u00f6tzlicher Herztod\u201c) f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen. Risikofaktoren f\u00fcr den \u201epl\u00f6tzlichen Herztod\u201c sind (zum Beispiel) eine hochgradig eingeschr\u00e4nkte Pumpfunktion des Herzens, bestimmte angeborene Herzerkrankungen sowie ein bereits \u00fcberlebter \u201epl\u00f6tzlicher Herztod\u201c.Ein eingesetzter Defibrillator erkennt die Herzrhythmusst\u00f6rungen und kann diese entweder schmerzlos und vom Patienten unbemerkt durch \u00dcberstimulation (sogenanntes anti-tachykardes Pacing) oder durch Schockabgabe (Defibrillation, schmerzhaft) beenden und den Herzrhythmus wieder normalisieren. Aufgrund der daf\u00fcr ben\u00f6tigten Energie ist das Aggregat eines Defibrillators etwas gr\u00f6\u00dfer als ein herk\u00f6mmlicher Herzschrittmacher. Alle implantierbaren Defibrillatoren beinhalten immer auch eine Schrittmacherfunktion.\nSubcutaneous or Transvenous Defibrillator TherapyThe subcutaneous implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) was designed to avoid complications related to the transvenous ICD lead by using an entirely extrathoracic placement. Evidence comparing these systems has been based primarily on observational studies. We conducted a noninferiority trial in which patients with an indication for an ICD but no indication for pacing were assigned to receive a subcutaneous ICD or transvenous ICD. The primary end point was the composite of device-related complications and inappropriate shocks; the noninferiority margin for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio (subcutaneous ICD vs. transvenous ICD) was 1.45. A superiority analysis was prespecified if noninferiority was established. Secondary end points included death and appropriate shocks.\nTime-to-First-Event Curves for the Primary End Point and Its Components. Shown is the cumulative incidence of the first occurrence of the composite primary end point (Panel A) and its components, the first device-related complication (Panel B) and the first inappropriate shock (Panel C). Hazard ratios were derived from Cox regressions and indicate the relative risk (subcutaneous ICD vs. transvenous ICD) of the end point. The 95% confidence intervals were not adjusted for multiple comparisons and therefore should not be used to infer definitive treatment effects. Insets show the same data on an enlarged y axis.With respect to the two components of the primary outcome, there was a higher cumulative incidence of device-related complications in the transvenous ICD group and a higher cumulative incidence of inappropriate shocks in the subcutaneous ICD group, although the trial was not powered for these comparisons.Perspectives may vary among physicians and patients about which component poses a heavier burden: whereas complications are associated primarily with physical distress, ICD shocks can have profound psychological implications.Primary Composite End Point.Secondary End Points.Das Zika virus geh\u00f6rt zur Gattung Flavivus. 1947 aus einem gezielt zum Auffinden desGelbfiebervirusgefangen gehaltenenRhesusaffen(einem sogenanntenMarkertierodersentinel monkey) einer Forschungsstation imZika ForestinEntebbe,Uganda, isoliert und nach dem Ort benannt.Das Virus kommtendemischinAfrikaundS\u00fcdostasienvor, die verschiedenen Virusst\u00e4mme werden deshalb in eine afrikanische und eine asiatische Gruppe unterteilt.

Der prinzipielle Aufbau und die m\u00f6glichen Virusproteine desZika-Virusunterscheiden sich nicht wesentlich von anderen Vertretern der GattungFlavivirus. Am n\u00e4chsten ist dasZika-Virusmit dem (noch nicht offiziell best\u00e4tigten) \u201aSpondweni-Virus\u2018 verwandt, mit dem es eineKladeinnerhalb der Moskito-\u00fcbertragenen Flaviviren bildet. Die erstenZika-Virus-Symptome zeigen sich etwa zwei bis sieben, manchmal auch erst zw\u00f6lf Tage nach der Infektion (Inkubationszeit). Die Anzeichen \u00e4hneln denen anderer von M\u00fccken \u00fcbertragener Viruskrankheiten, insbesondere denen des Dengue-oder Chikungunya-Fiebers.\nAufgrund der epidemiologischen Daten gab es seit Ende 2015 den dringenden Verdacht auf einen Zusammenhang zwischen Infektionen mit demZika-VirusbeiSchwangerenw\u00e4hrend des ersten Drittels der Schwangerschaft undMikrozephalienbei F\u00f6tenbeziehungsweise beiNeugeborenen. Anfang 2016 wurde der erste sichere virologische Nachweis f\u00fcr eine Infektion des f\u00f6talen Gehirns mit demZika-Virusbei bestehender Mikrozephalie erbracht. Die Sch\u00e4digung des f\u00f6talen Gehirns beginnt ab der 20.SSW mit einer St\u00f6rung derHirnrinden-Reifung und der Verz\u00f6gerung dergyralenFaltung. Ungew\u00f6hnlich ist auch der Umstand, dass das Virus 21Wochen beim F\u00f6tuspersistierteund die nach der m\u00fctterlichen Infektion gebildeten IgG-Antik\u00f6rper nach Ausheilung der akuten Infektion nicht in der Lage waren, die Infektion beim F\u00f6tus ebenfalls zu beenden. Die Ergebnisse untermauern den vorherigen Nachweis von Zika-Virus-RNA imFruchtwasserbei zwei mikrozephalen F\u00f6ten in Brasilien in der 29. bzw. 30.SSW.Auch bei diesen zwei F\u00e4llen entsprach die virale RNA den asiatischen Zika-Virus-Isolaten. DieUS-Gesundheitsbeh\u00f6rdeCDCkam im April 2016 nach Auswertung diverser Studien zu dem Schluss, dass Zika-Viren eindeutig die Sch\u00e4delfehlbildung Mikrozephalie bei F\u00f6ten verursacht.Im Dezember 2016 wurde in einer ersten, gr\u00f6\u00dferen Verlaufstudie an Schwangeren Belege daf\u00fcr gefunden, dass infolge einer Zika-Virus-Infektion das Risiko f\u00fcr Fehlbildungen und andere Sch\u00e4digungen im Vergleich mit einer Kontrollgruppe sehr erheblich erh\u00f6ht wird.\nEs existieren bislang weder eineImpfungnoch Medikamente zurKrankheitspr\u00e4vention. Bis m\u00f6glicherweise ein Impfstoff verf\u00fcgbar ist, k\u00f6nnten nach Einsch\u00e4tzung vieler Wissenschaftler Jahre vergehen. Erste potentielle Impfstoffe werden seit Juli 2016 inPhase-I-Studiengetestet, erste Ergebnisse werden jedoch nicht vor Ende 2017 vorliegenZika Virus Disease and Pregnancy Outcomes in ColombiaIn 2015 and 2016, Colombia had a widespread outbreak of Zika virus. Data from two national population-based surveillance systems for symptomatic Zika virus disease (ZVD) and birth defects provided complementary information on the effect of the Zika virus outbreak on pregnancies and infant outcomes. We collected national surveillance data regarding cases of pregnant women with ZVD that were reported during the period from June 2015 through July 2016. The presence of Zika virus RNA was identified in a subgroup of these women on real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. Brain or eye defects in infants and fetuses and other adverse pregnancy outcomes were identified among the women who had laboratory-confirmed ZVD and for whom data were available regarding pregnancy outcomes. We compared the nationwide prevalence of brain and eye defects during the outbreak with the prevalence both before and after the outbreak period.\nPregnant Women with Symptoms of Zika Virus Disease (ZVD) in Colombia, According to the Date of Symptom Onset (June 15, 2015\u2013July 31, 2016). Shown is the distribution of symptom onset among 18,117 pregnant women who were reported to the Colombian national surveillance system as having ZVD during the most recent outbreak. The numbers of total cases and laboratory-confirmed cases are provided. Laboratory confirmation was determined by the presence of Zika virus RNA on real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay.Analysis of Surveillance Data and Pregnancy Outcomes. To clarify the outcomes of pregnancies (including one set of twins), data are provided for infants or fetuses rather than pregnant women. The presence of Zika virus infection in infants or fetuses was confirmed on rRT-PCR assay.\nCharacteristics of Pregnant Women with Laboratory-Confirmed ZVD and Data Regarding Pregnancy Outcome, According to Trimester of ZVD Symptom Onset (June 15, 2015\u2013July 31, 2016).Laboratory-Confirmed ZVD among Pregnant Women and Reported Cases of Brain or Eye Defects among Infants or Fetuses. Panel A shows the number of pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed ZVD per 100,000 women of childbearing age in Colombia from June 15, 2015, to July 31, 2016, during the most recent outbreak of Zika virus infection. Panel B shows the number of reported cases of brain or eye defects among infants or fetuses in Colombia from September 2015 through April 2017.DiscussionDuring the Zika virus outbreak in Colombia from June 2015 through July 2016, the presence of ZVD in more than 18,000 pregnant women was reported to the national surveillance system. Among the women in this group who had laboratory-confirmed ZVD, 2% of their infants or fetuses had a brain or eye defect. Such defects were more common among infants carried by women who had an onset of ZVD symptoms during the first trimester of pregnancy than among those with a later symptom onset (3% vs. 1%). After the exclusion of infants or fetuses with brain or eye defects, 8% were born preterm and 6% had a low birth weight. However, these frequencies of preterm delivery and low birth weight were lower than population estimates in Colombia during 2014 (19% and 9%, respectively). Early in 2016, the Zika virus outbreak was deemed to be a public health emergency of international concern because of the threat posed to pregnant women and their developing infants.A rapid clinical and public health response was essential to identify the causal link between the virus and serious birth defects, and efforts are ongoing to understand the neurodevelopmental consequences of Zika virus infection during pregnancy. In a separate cohort of 70 Colombian infants with documented maternal Zika virus infection during pregnancy but no clinical signs of congenital Zika syndrome and normal prenatal neuroimaging, an assessment of neurodevelopment by standardized tools in infants between 4 and 18 months of age showed developmental scores falling further below the mean as the children aged. This finding emphasizes the importance of long-term follow-up of children with Zika virus exposure. In Colombia, as in every country that has had a Zika virus outbreak, affected children will need to be followed to identify all disabilities associated with this infection and to ensure that families are linked to needed services.In pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed ZVD, brain or eye defects in infants or fetuses were more common during the Zika virus outbreak than during the periods immediately before and after the outbreak. The frequency of such defects was increased among women with a symptom onset early in pregnancy.Zika Virus Disease in Colombia \u2014Preliminary ReportZika virus is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by the bite of an infected aedes mosquito. In Colombia, a country with a population of 48 million, Aedes aegyptiand Aedes albopictusmosquitoes are the species that are most commonly found at elevations below 2000 m above sea level. Transmission of Zika virus from mother to fetus and sexual transmission have both been reported. Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other severe brain defects in the fetus or infant and has been associated with other adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Colombia began official surveillance for Zika virus disease (ZVD) in August 2015. In October 2015, an outbreak of ZVD was declared after laboratory-confirmed disease was identified in nine patients. Using the national population-based surveillance system, we assessed patients with clinical symptoms of ZVD from August 9, 2015, to April 2, 2016. Laboratory test results and pregnancy outcomes were evaluated for a subgroup of pregnant women. Concurrently, we investigated reports of microcephaly for evidence of congenital ZVD.\nCumulative Incidence of Zika Virus Disease with Clinical Symptoms in Colombia, According to Reporting Area (August 9, 2015\u2013April 2, 2016). Shown are the reporting areas, which include 32 departments (i.e., states) and 5 districts (the major cities of Barranquilla, Bogot\u00e1, Buenaventura, Cartagena, and Santa Marta). The total incidence of Zika virus disease was reported separately for Barranquilla (which had 348 cases per 100,000 population), Cartagena (88 cases per 100,000), and Santa Marta (376 cases per 100,000). The Instituto Nacional de Salud did not report the incidence in Bogot\u00e1, since the cases originated in other reporting areas. The incidence in Buenaventura was included in the total number for the state of Valle del Cauca.Cumulative Incidence of Zika Virus Disease with Clinical Symptoms among Pregnant Women in Colombia, According to Reporting Area (August 9, 2015\u2013April 2, 2016). Shown is the incidence of Zika virus disease among pregnant women per 100,000 women of childbearing age in the reporting areas described in Figure 2. The incidence in these women was reported separately for Barranquilla (which had 342 cases per 100,000), Cartagena (27 cases per 100,000), and Santa Marta (306 cases per 100,000).Distribution of Days from the Onset of Symptoms of Zika Virus Disease to Sample Collection. Shown are data for 582 pregnant women with symptoms of Zika virus disease for whom Zika virus RNA was detectable on reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Of the 582 samples, 326 (56%) were positive for Zika virus. The mean number of days from the reported onset of symptoms to sample collection was 2.6 days for RT-PCR\u2013positive samples and 4.0 days for RT-PCR\u2013negative samples.Incidence of Zika Virus Disease with Clinical Symptoms in Colombia, According to Age and Sex (August 9, 2015\u2013April 2, 2016).DiscussionThe outbreak of ZVD has spread rapidly throughout Colombia since the first cluster of laboratory-confirmed cases was identified in October 2015, with 65,726 cases reported, including in 11,944 pregnant women as of April 2, 2016. However, these numbers underestimate the total effect of the ZVD outbreak, since they do not account for asymptomatic infection or unreported clinical illness. High ZVD incidence was reported among girls and women between the ages of 15 and 29 years, which was three times the incidence among male patients in the same age group. Notably, it is unclear to what extent reporting and testing biases may be inflating the number of women who have been identified with ZVD because of the concern about Zika infection during pregnancy. Projections that are based on the timing of the outbreak in Colombia would suggest that women with first-trimester exposures are likely to deliver at term beginning soon after the cutoff date for this report.The ongoing outbreak of ZVD in the Americas poses a major public health threat, particularly for fetuses of infected pregnant women. Nationwide population-based surveillance in Colombia has been critical for monitoring the status of the outbreak by focusing prevention efforts and rapidly assessing adverse outcomes. The INS continues to update its ZVD case counts and has started reporting the number of cases of microcephalyand the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome; links between Zika virus infection and these outcomes are being investigated further. The INS is implementing intensified surveillance of pregnant women with ZVD in selected sites to better understand the spectrum of adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes associated with Zika virus infection and to identify the effect of factors such as the timing of infection during pregnancy.ConclusionsPreliminary surveillance data in Colombia suggest that maternal infection with the Zika virus during the third trimester of pregnancy is not linked to structural abnormalities in the fetus. However, the monitoring of the effect of ZVD on pregnant women in Colombia is ongoing. Ofatumumab versus Teriflunomide in Multiple SclerosisOfatumumab, a subcutaneous anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, selectively depletes B cells. Teriflunomide, an oral inhibitor of pyrimidine synthesis (immune-modulatory thalidomide derivative), reduces T-cell and B-cell activation. The relative effects of these two drugs in patients with multiple sclerosis are not known.In two double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3 trials, we randomly assigned patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis to receive subcutaneous ofatumumab (20 mg every 4 weeks after 20-mg loading doses at days 1, 7, and 14) or oral teriflunomide (14 mg daily) for up to 30 months. The primary end point was the annualized relapse rate. Secondary end points included disability worsening confirmed at 3 months or 6 months, disability improvement confirmed at 6 months, the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions per T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, the annualized rate of new or enlarging lesions on T2-weighted MRI, serum neurofilament light chain levels at month 3, and change in brain volume.\nDemographic and Disease Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline (Full Analysis Set).Clinical, MRI, and Biomarker End Points (Full Analysis Set).Confirmed Disability Worsening and Improvement.Adverse Events (Safety Population).DiscussionIn these two simultaneously conducted active-controlled trials involving patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis, both ofatumumab and teriflunomide were associated with low relapse rates. The relapse rate was significantly lower with ofatumumab than with teriflunomide in each of the two trials. In a prespecified meta-analysis of both trials, the percentages of patients with disability worsening confirmed at 3 months or 6 months were lower with ofatumumab than with teriflunomide, but the groups did not differ significantly with respect to confirmed disability improvement. The results of these trials do not permit any inferences to be made about the efficacy of ofatumumab as compared with other drugs for multiple sclerosis that are considered to be more potent than teriflunomide.Ofatumumab was also superior to teriflunomide in suppressing lesion activity on MRI. Lesion counts on MRI in the teriflunomide groups were higher than those previously reported in one phase 3 trial of teriflunomide as compared with placebo, which suggests a population with more disease activity overall in the ASCLEPIOS trials, differences in the assessment methods used at the MRI analysis centers, or both.Ofatumumab was associated with lower annualized relapse rates than teriflunomide and showed benefit with respect to most secondary clinical and MRI end points but not confirmed disability improvement. Ofatumumab was associated with a higher frequency of injection-related systemic reactions, predominantly with the first injection, than was placebo injection. Larger and longer trials are required to determine the long-term effect and risks of ofatumumab as compared with other disease-modifying treatments, including other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.ConclusionsAmong patients with multiple sclerosis, ofatumumab was associated with lower annualized relapse rates than teriflunomide.Native-Valve Infective EndocarditisA 72-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus, stage 2 chronic kidney disease, and a history of mild aortic stenosis is admitted to the hospital with fever, dysuria, and urinary frequency. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C, the pulse is regular at 110 beats per minute, and the blood pressure is 145/95 mm Hg. His lungs are clear; a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard at the right upper sternal border. Laboratory tests are notable for a hemoglobin level of 12 g per deciliter, a white-cell count of 13,500 per cubic millimeter (with 80% polymorphonuclear cells), a serum glucose level of 340 mg per deciliter (18.7 mmol per liter), a serum creatinine level of 1.7 mg per deciliter (150 \u03bcmol per liter), and a urinalysis with 3+ protein, 20 to 50 white cells per high-power field, and 4+ glucose. Two blood cultures and a urine culture are positive for ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis.How would you further evaluate and treat this patient?Epidemiology, Pathololgy, Clinical FeaturesNative-valve infective endocarditis is uncommon, with an incidence of approximately 2 to 10 cases per 100,000 person-years. The presumed initiating event is injury to the valvular endothelium or endocardium. This injury exposes subendothelial collagen and other matrix molecules to which platelets and fibrin adhere and form a microthrombotic lesion called a sterile vegetation. Bacteria circulating in the bloodstream then bind to and colonize this lesion. In the absence of an effective host response, bacteria replicate in situ, stimulating further platelet and fibrin deposition to form an infected vegetation that is the hallmark of infective endocarditis\nPredispositionCardiac conditions that predispose to infective endocarditis include congenital disease (e.g., ventricular septal defect and bicuspid aortic valve) and acquired valvular disease (e.g., degenerative valvular disease, aortic stenosis, and rheumatic heart disease). Rheumatic heart disease, the most common predisposing condition for infective endocarditis in developing countries, is uncommon in developed countries, where the most frequent predisposing cardiac conditions are degenerative valvular diseases, congenital valvular abnormalities, and intracardiac devices. Noncardiac risk factors include poor dentition, intravenous drug use, hemodialysis, chronic liver disease, diabetes, compromised immunity, neoplastic disease, and indwelling intravascular devices.Fever and heart murmur, the two signature features of infective endocarditis, are present in approximately 90% and 75% of patients, respectively. Infective endocarditis may present acutely with a rapidly progressive course complicated by congestive heart failure, stroke, systemic or pulmonary embolization, severe sepsis or septic shock, or subacutely with nonspecific symptoms such as low-grade fever, malaise, chills, sweats, dyspnea, back pain, arthralgias, and weight loss over a period of weeks or sometimes months. Microembolic or immunologic phenomena such as splinter hemorrhage, conjunctival hemorrhage, Osler nodes (distal vasculitic lesions of the fingers and toes), Janeway lesions (vasculitic lesions of the palms and soles), and Roth spots (hemorrhagic retinal lesions) are present in 5 to 10% of patients.Microbiologic FeaturesWorldwide, gram-positive bacteria account for approximately 80% of cases of native-valve infective endocarditis. These bacteria include Staphylococcus aureusin 35 to 40% of cases of native-valve infective endocarditis, streptococci in 30 to 40% (viridans streptococci in approximately 20% and Streptococcus gallolyticus[formerly S. bovis] and other streptococci in approximately 15%), and enterococci in 10%. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, a common cause of prosthetic-valve infective endocarditis, are uncommon in native-valve infective endocarditis, except for S. lugdunensis, which resembles S. aureusclinically. HACEK species (haemophilus species, aggregatibacter [formerly actinobacillus] species, cardiobacterium species, Eikenella corrodens, and kingella species), fungi, polymicrobial infection, and, rarely, aerobic gram-negative bacilli are isolated in 5% of cases.Modified Duke Criteria for the Clinical Diagnosis of Infective Endocarditis.Diagnosis of Culture-Negative Endocarditis.Antimicrobial Regimens for Treatment of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis.Antimicrobial Regimens for Treatment of Native-Valve Infective Endocarditis.Indications for Early Cardiac-Valve Surgery.Areas of UncertaintyModified Duke criteria for the clinical diagnosis of infective endocarditis are not based on the results of molecular diagnostic testing. As these methods improve in accuracy and become routinely available, their role in diagnosis will need to be taken into account.Whether routine brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other advanced imaging techniques such as PET-CT improve the diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes in patients with native-valve infective endocarditis is unclear. MRI is more sensitive than CT for detecting central nervous system (CNS) lesions, and the presence of asymptomatic embolic lesions in patients with suspected infective endocarditis is a minor criterion in support of the diagnosis. Routine brain MRI has been recommended to detect silent CNS emboli in patients who are candidates for valvular surgery, although whether this improves outcomes is unknown.Data from randomized, controlled trials to inform the benefits and risks of oral antimicrobial therapy for infective endocarditis are limited. The Partial Oral Treatment of Endocarditis (POET) trial showed that in patients with infective endocarditis on the left side of the heart and whose condition had stabilized, treatment with oral antibiotics after an initial course of intravenous antibiotics was noninferior to standard intravenous antibiotic treatment at 6 months after the end of treatment; longer-term follow-up showed no deleterious outcomes with oral step-down therapy. However, only 20% of the patients who underwent screening were enrolled, and few had S. aureusinfection (none with MRSA). Additional data are needed to clarify the safety and efficacy of this approach in a variety of clinical settings.Necrolytic Migratory Erythema Associated with a GlucagonomaUvula Amyloidosis\nA 34-year-old man presented to a community hospital in Vancouver, Canada, with a 1-month history of constant diffuse abdominal pain, fatigue, and anorexia associated with a weight loss of 2.7 kg but no fevers or night sweats. He reported constipation but no diarrhea, melena, or hematochezia. His medical history and travel history were unremarkable. The patient was from Indiabut had lived in Canada since he was 13 years of age. He worked at a family-run business and lived with his wife and his parents. His medications included gabapentin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen with codeine, all of which had been prescribed for his recent pain. He reported that he did not use nicotine-containing products, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.On examination, the patient\u2019s temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 117/73 mm Hg, the pulse 99 beats per minute, the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. He appeared thin with conjunctival pallor. The jugular venous pressure was 1 cm above the sternal angle. The cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic examinations were normal. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. The abdominal examination revealed mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant, with no rebound tenderness, guarding, ascites, masses, or organomegaly. Bowel sounds were normal.The hemoglobin level was 7.7 g per deciliter, and the hematocrit 25%, with a mean corpuscular volume of 73 fl. The platelet count was 344,000 per cubic millimeter, and the white-cell count 11,300 per cubic millimeter, with 90% polymorphonuclear leukocytes and a normal eosinophil count. The ferritin level was 316 ng per milliliter (normal range, 15 to 300), the iron level 184 \u03bcg per deciliter (33 \u03bcmol per liter) (normal range, 60 to 150 \u03bcg per deciliter [11 to 27 \u03bcmol per liter]), the total iron-binding capacity 290 \u03bcg per deciliter (52 \u03bcmol per liter) (normal range, 250 to 425 \u03bcg per deciliter [45 to 76 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the transferrin saturation 63% (normal range, 20 to 55). The aspartate aminotransferase level was 100 U per liter (normal range, 10 to 38), the alanine aminotransferase level 162 U per liter (normal range, 10 to 80), the \u03b3-glutamyltransferase level 195 U per liter (normal range, 15 to 80), and the alkaline phosphatase level 132 U per liter (normal range, 30 to 135); the bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase levels were normal. No recent blood test results were available for comparison. The results of renal-function tests were normal, as were the levels of electrolytes, thyrotropin, serum vitamin B12, and C-reactive protein; the international normalized ratio; and the activated partial-thromboplastin time. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomenrevealed thickening of the rectum and sigmoid colon near the hepatic flexure, with a normal-appearing terminal ileum and no lymphadenopathyLed astrayPeripheral-Blood Smear. A peripheral-blood smear shows microcytosis of red cells with basophilic stippling (Wright\u2013Giemsa stain).The clever discussantThe abnormalities noted on CT warrant endoscopic investigation. The patient\u2019s microcytic anemia with nucleated red cells is of interest. A ferritin level of greater than 200 ng per deciliter, along with elevated levels of serum iron and transferrin saturation, are inconsistent with iron deficiency. The normal C-reactive protein level makes an inflammatory cause of anemia (i.e., anemia of chronic disease) unlikely, although it does not rule it out. In a patient of South Asian ancestry, thalassemia should be considered;however, it would not explain his abdominal pain. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis, a direct antiglobulin test, measurement of the haptoglobin level, and measurement of the hemoglobin level with the use of high-performance liquid chromatography should be performed. Serologic tests for HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses should also be performed, particularly given the patient\u2019s elevated liver-enzyme levels. It would also be worthwhile to measure the blood lead level, since lead poisoning can cause microcytic anemia with basophilic stippling and abdominal pain.Clinical courseThe patient was admitted to the hospital for further investigation. Upper and lower endoscopy revealed normal-appearing mucosa, with no bleeding or inflammation; random biopsy specimens of the rectum, terminal ileum, duodenum, and stomach were obtained. Ultrasonography of the liver revealed diffuse fatty infiltration. The patient received morphine, which reduced his pain.He was discharged home with pantoprazoleat a dose of 40 mg per day; given the presence of microcytic anemia, the presumptive diagnosis was thalassemia, although the results of the hemoglobin electrophoresis were pending. After discharge, the gastric-biopsy specimens showed evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection; despite treatment with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin, the symptoms did not abate. Examinations of the other biopsy specimens were negative, as was the test for hemoglobinopathy.Clinical courseDuring the next 6 weeks, the patient had three subsequent visits to the emergency department for ongoing abdominal pain. He was referred to a gastroenterologist for a capsule endoscopy; the results were normal. He was then readmitted to the hospital; he had lost an additional 11 kg of weight and had a new headache on the right side that had lasted 2 to 3 hours, with associated nausea but no photophobia or neck stiffness. He remained afebrile. An additional workup included serologic testing for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, testing for syphilis and HIV infection, serum protein electrophoresis, lumbar puncture, blood cultures, urine cultures, chest radiography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and spine, all of which were unremarkable. The patient was seen by a neurologist, a rheumatologist, and an infectious-disease specialist. He was ultimately discharged home with an unclear diagnosis (with his presentation postulated to be related to a viral illness), and outpatient follow-up with a hematologist was planned. He received a prescription for hydromorphone to be used as needed for ongoing abdominal pain.Clever discussantMicrocytic anemia is one such finding. Iron deficiency, the most common cause, has been ruled out, as has thalassemia; the other conditions that can cause a microcytic anemia are inflammation, sideroblastic anemia (congenital or acquired), and lead poisoning. The sideroblastic anemias are rare bone marrow disorders characterized by abnormal iron accumulation in the mitochondria of erythroid precursors, which manifest as ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow aspirate. Congenital forms such as X-linked sideroblastic anemia typically manifest in childhood. Acquired sideroblastic anemia can be caused by alcohol use, medications such as isoniazid and linezolid (which the patient has not received), or copper deficiency, which can be caused by excess ingestion of zinc or by malabsorptive disorders. Given an ongoing unexplained microcytic anemia with nucleated red cells, the blood levels of lead and copper should be assessed; if the levels are normal, I would recommend a bone marrow biopsy.Clinical courseOne week later, the patient returned to the hospital after having a witnessed generalized seizure. Despite treatment with diazepam and phenytoin, he had subsequent recurrent seizures with interictal somnolence that resulted in intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit. He was afebrile on presentation. A neurologic examination did not suggest any focal lesions. CT of the head was unremarkable. Urine drug screening was positive only for opioids, a finding that was consistent with his prescribed medications, and ethanol was not detected in the serum. His blood tests continued to indicate microcytic anemia, and he had a normal C-reactive protein level. His liver-enzyme levels were now normal.The trachea was extubated on hospital day 2. Examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen and bone marrow aspirate showed normal trilineage hematopoiesis with occasional ringed sideroblasts and no evidence of myelodysplasia or a lymphoproliferative disorder. On hospital day 6, a critically elevated serum level of free protoporphyrin was reported (612.4 \u03bcg per deciliter [10.84 \u03bcmol per liter]) (normal range, 15 to 50 \u03bcg per deciliter [0.27 to 0.88 \u03bcmol per liter]); this blood test had been ordered to investigate for porphyria.\nBone Marrow Aspirate Smear. A bone marrow aspirate smear shows ringed sideroblasts with iron granules accumulating around the nuclei of erythroid precursors (Prussian blue stain).Clever discussantAcutehepaticporphyrias\u2014themostcommonofwhichisacuteintermittentporphyria\u2014canproduceneurovisceralsymptoms, such asabdominal painandseizures, but wouldnot causeanemia.

The diagnostic errors in this case stemmed predominantly from faulty knowledge synthesis, whereby the clinicians failed to consider lead poisoning earlier in the clinical course despite highly suggestive clinical signs and symptoms, including abdominal pain, microcytic anemia, and basophilic stippling. As a result, the patient underwent repeated endoscopic studies and had added complications. Given the availability, accuracy, and relatively low cost of serum lead testing, this test should be performed promptly in patients whose presentation is compatible with lead poisoning. Once a high lead level is documented, the source must be identified to prevent continued exposure. Lead-contaminated opium has led to thousands of cases of lead poisoning in the Middle East and several cases in Europe and Australia. This case highlights the effect of globalized illicit drug trade, whereby lead poisoning from opium occurred in North America. Lead poisoning is a diagnosis that is often overlooked. Although the typical clinical features of abdominal pain and weight loss are nonspecific, a focus on the limited number of causes of microcytic anemia ultimately led to the diagnosis. In Iran and other Middle Eastern countries, numerous cases of lead poisoning from lead-contaminated opium have been reported. During an 18-month period from 2016 to 2017, more than 4000 persons across two large hospitals in Tehran were treated for lead poisoning resulting from ingestion of opium. The concentration of lead found in the opium sample tested in this case, 23 ppm, is within the range of concentrations reported in other cases of opium ingestion, in which concentrations ranged from 1.8 to 3200 ppm.The reason for lead contamination in opium is not known, but two leading hypotheses are that lead is added to increase the weight, thereby increasing profit, or that it results from the manufacturing process.Alsbasophile T\u00fcpfelungwerden multiple, kleinebasophileGranulainErythrozytenbezeichnet.

Aug 1, 2020)To the EditorWe retrospectively studied 248 patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) affected by COVID-19 in 19 private and academic MHD centers of the Paris, France area.Mean follow-up was 40 days (+/-19). Hospitalization rate was 58%. Overall mortality was 18.1% (30% in hospitalized patients) (Tables S1-S2). Ninety-six (39%) patients were previously treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). By multivariate analysis, the main risk factors associated with mortality were age, facility living, dyspnea and previous immunosuppressive treatment. Average treatment effects were further analyzed by propensity score analysis (Supplemental Methods and Table S3). Hydroxychloroquine(OR=1.02 [0.6,1.71], p=.95), macrolides(OR=1.64 [0.94,2.84], p=.079) and 3rdgeneration cephalosporins(OR=1.35 [0.8,2.29], p=.265) had no significant effect on mortality. Conversely, previous immunosuppressive treatment was associated with increased mortality (OR=2.67 [1.43,5.01], p=.002), and previous treatment with ACEi, or ARB was associated with reduced mortality (OR=0.51 [0.31,0.85], p=.01).\nDerKahnbeinbruchoder dieKahnbeinfrakturist einBruch(Fraktur) einesKahnbeins\u2013entweder desOs scaphoideumder Handwurzel oder desOs naviculareder Fu\u00dfwurzel. DasOs scaphoideumwird verk\u00fcrzt eingedeutscht auchSkaphoidgenannt \u2013daher wird hier auch von einerSkaphoidfrakturgesprochen. Die Verletzung des Kahnbeins macht drei Viertel aller Handwurzelbr\u00fcche aus. Sie entsteht in der Regel durch direkte Gewalteinwirkung, zum Beispiel durch einen Sturz auf die nach hinten \u00fcberstreckte (dorsalextendierte) Hand mit einem Aufprall auf deren speichenseitige (radiale) H\u00e4lfte. Die genaue H\u00f6he des Bruchs h\u00e4ngt dabei von der St\u00e4rke der \u00dcberstreckung und speichenseitige Seitbewegung (Radialabduktion) der Hand im Augenblick des Aufpralls ab. Am h\u00e4ufigsten tritt die Verletzung im Sport auf, etwa 90% der Patienten sind M\u00e4nner, und die h\u00e4ufigste Altersgruppe ist die zwischen 20 und 30 Jahren. Die Heilung einer Skaphoidfraktur an der Hand ist abh\u00e4ngig vom genauen Ort des Bruchs schwierig, da die Blutversorgung vorwiegend von k\u00f6rperfern erfolgt, und kann acht bis zw\u00f6lf Wochen dauern. In dieser Zeit wird dasHandgelenkmitDaumengrundgelenkbis zum Unterarm inGipsoder einer Schiene ruhiggestellt.Als gute Alternative zur Gipsbehandlung bietet sich eine Verschraubung des Kahnbeines mit einer speziellen, durchbohrten Schraube mit zwei Gewinden unterschiedlicher Steigungen an. Diese Form der Schraube bewirkt eine Kompression der Bruchfragmente. Die am h\u00e4ufigsten verwendeten Schrauben dieser Art sind die nachTimothy James HerbertbenannteHerbert-Schraubeund dieBold-Schraube. DieOsteosynthesewird in der Regel \u00fcber einen kleinen Schnitt an der Beugeseite des Handgelenks vorgenommen. Vorteil der minimal invasiven Operation ist die stabile sichere Versorgung des Bruches und die durch die Operation zeitlich erheblich verk\u00fcrzte Gipsnachbehandlung.Thirty single amino acid substitutions highly enriched in the nCoV-S-High sort were validated by targeted mutagenesis.
