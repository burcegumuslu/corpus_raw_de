But far from having a sane heart and mind, we carry within us countless impressions, suppression, desires and negative traits such as greed, anger, lust, hatred and jealousy. Above all, we are cut off from nature and this contributes to the development of a schizophrenic mind ultimately resulting to all health problems. The science of meditation offers various techniques, methods and therapies to help us transform our base nature and attain mental and emotional purity. Various studies have shown that meditation techniques, including those based on breathing, help in healing as blood pressure is lowered, mind is calmed and positive traits like willpower and self-confidence are boosted. By practising dynamic methods we can eliminate stress, anxiety and depression and enjoy liveliness and deep relaxation. This paper investigates how through the regular practice of some meditation techniques, powerful vibrations are generated within us and these may eliminate some diseases and illnesses. However, being a divine science aiming at experiencing the soul, meditation is not a means to cure illnesses. If one gets cured by meditation, it is only as by-product.|\n|ISSN:||2154-8641|\n|Contains:|", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["#content", "/", "/", "#", "/Content/Impressum", "/Content/privacy", "/Content/A-Z", "/MyResearch/Home?redirect=0", "/MyResearch/Logout", "/MyResearch/UserLogin", "#", "/Record/1840926856?lng=en", "/Record/1840926856?lng=de", "/Record/1840926856?lng=es", "/Record/1840926856?lng=fr", "/Record/1840926856?lng=it", "/Record/1840926856?lng=pt", "/Record/1840926856?lng=zh-cn", "/Record/1840926856?lng=zh", "/Record/1840926856?lng=el", "/Record/1840926856?lng=ru", "/", null, "/Search2/Home?hiddenFilters%5B%5D=has_fulltext%3A%221%22", "/Authority/Home", "/Search/Advanced", "#", "/Keywordchainsearch/Home", "/Browse/Home", "/Alphabrowse/Home", "#", "/Help/Home?topic=search", "/Search/NewItem", "#", "/Record/1840926856", "/Record/1840926856/Cite", "/Record/1840926856/Email", "/Record/1840926856?print=1", "/Record/1840926856/Export", "/Record/1840926856/Export?style=RIS", "/Record/1840926856/Export?style=EndNote", "/Record/1840926856/Export?style=RefWorks", "/Record/1840926856/Export?style=PPN_to_DA3", "/Record/1840926856/Save", "/Help/Home?topic=publication", "/Record/1840926856/Description#tabnav", "/MyResearch/Favorites", "/Search/Results?lookfor=%22The+international+journal+of+religion+and+spirituality+in+society%22&type=JournalTitle\n", "  /Author/Home?author=Paramananda%2C+Swami", "http://openurlgw.hbz-nrw.de/gw?title=Meditation%3A+The+Key+to+Overall+Wellness", "http://services.dnb.de/fize-service/gvr/html-service.htm?sid=bib%3Atueb&issn=2154-8641&genre=article&lang=en&volume=5&issue=4&date=2015&pages=109-123&pid=client_ip%3D217.238.136.176", "/Search/Results?type=Publisher&lookfor=Common%20Ground%20Publishing", "/Record/683370324", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Spirituality%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Spirituality&type=Subject\n", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Ailments%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Ailments&type=Subject\n", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Disease%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Disease&type=Subject\n", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Meditation%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Meditation&type=Subject\n", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Cure%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Cure&type=Subject\n", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Health%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Health&type=Subject\n", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Meditation+Techniques%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Meditation+Techniques&type=Subject\n", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Wellness%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Wellness&type=Subject\n", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Mental+Health%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Mental+Health&type=Subject\n", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Well+Being%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Well+Being&type=Subject\n", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Physical+Health%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Physical+Health&type=Subject\n", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Mind%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Mind&type=Subject\n", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Good+Health%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Good+Health&type=Subject\n", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Wheel+of+Wellness%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Wheel+of+Wellness&type=Subject\n", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Breathing+Techniques%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Breathing+Techniques&type=Subject\n", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Spiritual+Health%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Spiritual+Health&type=Subject\n", "/Keywordchainsearch/Results?lookfor=%22Emotional+Health%22", "/Search/Results?lookfor=Emotional+Health&type=Subject\n", "https://doi.org/10.18848/2154-8633/CGP/v05i04/51129", "https://cgscholar.com/bookstore/works/meditation-the-key-to-overall-wellness", null, "/Record/1840926856/Description#tabnav", "/Record/1840926856/FulltextSearch#tabnav", "/Record/1840926856/Details#tabnav", "/Record/683370324", "https://doi.org/10.18848/2154-8633/CGP/v05i04/51129", "/Record/1809853168", "/Record/1566095980", "/Record/1733824936", "/Record/1668465760", "/Record/1669263177", "/Record/1588235645", "/Record/1779672160", "/Record/1668859734", "/Record/1668640880", "/Record/174470337X", "/Record/1668757923", "/Record/1669216381", "/Record/174467650X", "/Record/1575861151", "/Record/1813926026", "/Record/1670219917", "/Record/1586240749", "/Record/175755906X", "/Record/1839007257", "/Record/1853990299", "/Feedback/home", "/Search/History", "/Search/Advanced", "/Keywordchainsearch/Home", "/Browse/Home", "/Alphabrowse/Home", "/Search/NewItem", "/Help/Home?topic=search", "/Feedback/Form/AcquisitionRequest", "//twitter.com/ix_theo"]}
