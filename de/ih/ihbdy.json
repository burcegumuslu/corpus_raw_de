At fourteen years old, Dominique Moceanu was the youngest member of the 1996 US Women\u2019s Olympic Gymnastics team, the first and only American women\u2019s team to take gold at the Olympics. Her pixyish appearance and ferocious competitive drive quickly earned her the status of media darling. But behind the fame, the flawless floor routines, and the million-dollar smile, her life was a series of challenges and hardships. Off Balance vividly delineates each of the dominating characters who contributed to Moceanu\u2019s rise to the top, from her stubborn father and long-suffering mother to her mercurial coach, Bela Karolyi. Here, Moceanu finally shares the haunting stories of competition, her years of hiding injuries and pain out of fear of retribution from her coaches, and how she hit rock bottom after a public battle with her parents. But medals, murder plots, drugs, and daring escapes aside (all of which figure into Moceanu\u2019s incredible journey), the most unique aspect of her life is the family secret that Moceanu discovers, opening a new and unexpected chapter in her adult life. A mysterious letter from a stranger reveals that she has a second sister\u2014born with a physical disability and given away at birth\u2014who has nonetheless followed in Moceanu\u2019s footsteps in an astonishing way. A multilayered memoir that transcends the world of sports, Off Balance will touch anyone who has ever dared to dream of a better life.", "language": null, "image": "https://images.nextory.com/9781451608670.jpg?fit=clip&auto=format&w=630", "pagetype": null, "links": ["/at", "/at/search?q", "/at/profile/login", "/at", "/at/categories/books", "/at/e-books", "/at/audiobooks", "https://support.nextory.se/hc/de", "/at/download-apps", "/at/register/campaign/activate", "/at/register/giftcard/info", "/at/register", "/at/profile/login", "/at/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/at-en/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/be-fr/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/be-en/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/dk/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/dk-en/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/de/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/de-en/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/es/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/es-en/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/fr/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/fr-en/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/nl/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/nl-en/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/no/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/no-en/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/ch/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/ch-en/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/fi/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/fi-en/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/se/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/se-en/book/off-balance-a-memoir-440511", "/at/register", "/at/author/dominique-moceanu-315286", "https://support.nextory.se/hc/de", "/at/about", "https://career.nextory.com/", "https://news.cision.com/de/nextory-ab", "https://investors.nextory.com/", "at/collab/contact/at/", "https://www.instagram.com/nextory/", "https://www.facebook.com/Nextory/", "#", "/at/privacy-policy", "/at/user-terms", "/at/imprint"]}
