Because of its clinical relevance, the development of a vaccine is a major goal in biomedical science. Subviral dense bodies (DB) represent a promising basis for the HCMV vaccine development. The internal structure of these particles consists of dominant target antigens of the T lymphocyte responses. The envelope of DB resembles that of mature virions and contains the viral surface proteins, the targets of the neutralizing antibody (ntabs) response, in their natural conformation. The extraordinary immunogenicity of DB had been documented before. One goal of this work was to elucidate the molecular background of the extraordinary immunogenicity of DB. In a first part, the hypothesis was tested that DB mediate maturation and activation of dendritic cells (DC), thereby enhancing their capacity for antigen presentation. Such cells play an important role in the priming of T-lymphocyte responses. DB loading of DC resulted in up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules that are related to the maturation of these cells. The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines provided the evidence for DC activation, representing an inflammatory response. DB loaded DC were further suitable to stimulate CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. These results showed that DB indeed impart an adjuvant effect which is the basis for their immunogenic properties. rnThe ntabs response to DB immunization was analyzed in a second part of this work. Antibodies are key effectors for the prevention of HCMV transmission. One task of this work was to test, if strain specific differences in the expression of viral surface proteins had an impact on the induction of ntabs following DB immunization. The major parameter to be tested here was whether the variable expression of a pentameric protein complex, consisting of gH/gL/pUL128-UL131A influenced the ntabs response. This complex is an integral part of the surface of clinical HCMV isolates (HCMVClin), only, and determines their broad host cell range; laboratory strains (HCMVLab) are devoid of this complex and thus the response towards it had not been addressed in past studies on DB immunogenicity, based on DBLab. A first set of experiments showed that DBLab immunization induced an ntabs response that are also, to some extent, protective against HCMVClin infection. This was a surprising finding, as, according to current literature, one would have expected antibodies specific for the pentameric complex to be essential for HCMVClin neutralization. In contrast to that, this work showed that the response to other surface protein complexes may suffice to confer some level of protection. This raised the question about the requirement to include the pentameric complex in a DB-based vaccine. In order to investigate, if DB containing the pentameric complex were more effective in inducing ntabs, a laboratory strain was modified by mutating its 235 kpb genome in a way to allow expression of the pentameric complex. The components of the pentameric complex could be detected in DB of this strain, providing the proof that DB do also package the pentameric complex. The sera of animals that were immunized with these DB indeed showed increased neutralization capacity on different cell types. These results underscore that the expression of the pentameric complex on DB confers an advantage over DBLab in inducing ntabs. Taken together the findings of this work provide a valuable contribution in our understanding of the immunogenicity of DB. This work has provided the basis for a now ongoing project to test the DB-vaccine in first clinical trials.\n570 Life sciences", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["#content", "https://ub.uni-mainz.de", "#", "/mydspace", "/profile", "#", "/advanced-search", "/community-list", "/browse?type=author", "/browse?type=title", "/browse?type=dateissued", "/browse?type=dateavailable", "/browse?type=subject", "/browse?type=type", "/browse?type=department", "#", "https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/3684?locale=en", "https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/3684?locale=de", "#", "/help-faq", "/help-research", "/help-faq-search", "/help-publish", "https://www.ub.uni-mainz.de/de/dissertationen", "/contact", "/", "/handle/20.500.12030/1", "/handle/20.500.12030/2", "/browse?type=author&value=Sauer%2C+Caroline", "https://ror.org/023b0x485", "http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-3682", "https://nbn-resolving.org/urn/resolver.pl?urn=nbn:de:hebis:77-36463", "https://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/", "/handle/20.500.12030/2", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/3684/1/3646.pdf", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/3684/1/3646.pdf", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/3684/1/3646.pdf", "/handle/20.500.12030/3684?mode=full", "/handle/20.500.12030/3684/statistics", "/imprint", "/privacy", "/contact", "/guidelines", "https://doi.org/10.18452/24678", "https://www.uni-mainz.de/"]}
