The use of recovered pulp - i.e. pulp ob-\ntained from recovered paper - in paper production is of great \nimportance  with respect to the conservation of resource s and \nreduction of greenhouse gas emissio ns. Accordingly, it is very \nimportant to have correct information on this. However, there \nare numerous indications of data gaps and errors in the inter-\nnational database of the FAO regarding figures on the produc-\ntion and trade of wood and paper products.  \nGuiding questions  \nHow many countries are actually affected by data gaps and er-\nrors in figures on recovered pulp production? Can we estimate \na more realistic value for the recovered pulp production of the \ncountries affected by these inconsistencies? What is t he actual \nratio between virgin and recovered fiber use in the paper pro-\nduction of these countries?  \nMethodological approach  \nIn order to resolve the inconsistencies in this area, we devel-\noped national pulp and paper balances for the most important \npulp and p aper produc ing and consum ing countries. This in-\nvolves comparing the input of wood fibers (virgin pulp and re-\ncovered pulp) with the output (paper products). By doing so , the \namount of recovered pulp production, which is considered the \nmost inaccurate  position on the balance sheet , can be deter-\nmined as a residual volume . Furthermore, we can also use this \nmethod to determine the composition of paper production in \nterms of the proportions of virgin fibers and recovered fibers.  Results  \nOur analyses show that only 7.6 percent of all countries in the \ninternational database of the FAO have plausible data on recov-\nered pulp production. Of the major pulp and paper producing \nand consuming countries (top 28), 11 countries already report \nplausibl e data on recovered pulp production. Another 6 coun-\ntries had to be excluded from the analys es due to inconsisten-\ncies in the data structure. The analyses were therefore carried \nout for 11 countries (Tab. 1). We calculate d a mean recovered \npulp production of 2.5 million tons. In contrast, the mean re-\nported recovered pulp production of the countries investigated \namounts to  only 0.8 million tons. The method thus allows the \nreduction of data errors and gaps as well as further information \ngain. The share of recov ered pulp in the paper production of the \ncountries investigated varies between 4.1 % and 84.4 % and is \n44.4 % on average.  \nTab. 1: Comparison of calculated (\ud835\udc77\u0302) and reported  recovered pulp produc-\ntion in the FAO database (PFAO) supplemented by  the share of recovered \npulp (\u03b1) in paper production.  \n \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc42 \u03b1 \nCountry   in 1,000 kg in % \nBrazil  3,128,480  0 31.4 \nChile  473,354  0 39.5  \nIndia  8,922,755  1,196,300  55.4 \nItaly  4,471,336  3,910,000  53.3 \nMexico  4,724,343  2,889,000  80.9 \nNew Zealand  110,415  207,000  15.2 \nPoland  2,426,583  0 51.6 \nRussia  1,923,228  100,000  21.9 \nSweden  385,256  250,000  4.1 \nTurkey  1,406,824  0 50.4 \nUruguay  51,048  0 84.4 Th\u00fcnen Institute of International Forestry and Forest Economics \nPulp and paper balances to supplement interna-\ntional statistics  \nDominik Jochem1, Mat thias B\u00f6sch1, Holge r Weimar1, Mat thias Dieter1 2021/23a \n\ud835\udc43\u0302", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
