This first global generation, shaped by economic, social, and technological shifts, shares similar characteristics and attitudes worldwide. However, beneath these surface-level similarities, substantial differences in their perspectives on work and life exist, which raises the question of whether millennials share similar expectations regarding work-life balance and, if not, how their cultural background influences these expectations. Therefore, this research aimed to explore the impact of culture on work-life balance expectations among millennials in Austria, Canada, and Taiwan. Adopting a qualitative, exploratory research approach, twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with recent university graduates. The findings reveal that culture plays a significant role in shaping millennials' work-life balance expectations, influencing their priorities, values, and behaviors. The study draws upon established literature and empirical insights, highlighting the contributions of cultural dimensions such as individualism vs. collectivism and uncertainty avoidance by Hofstede as well as the performance orientation dimension by GLOBE, in understanding millennials' work-life balance expectations. Furthermore, the significance of Confucian values, including social harmony and filial piety, is highlighted in the Taiwanese context. Additionally, the research highlights the emerging trend of an individualistic mindset across cultures, the influence of gender roles, and the powerful impact of technology and social media. In summary, millennials in the studied cultures demonstrate a strong drive to work hard while seeking flexibility and autonomy in managing their work-life interface. These insights provide valuable guidance for organizations and policymakers in developing effective policies and practices that support millennials' work-life balance, enhance their overall well-being, and contribute to organizational success. By comprehending the influence of culture on millennials' work-life balance expectations, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of this generation and their evolving needs in the modern workplace.\n[Millennials' Work-Life Balance Expecations [pdf 1.05 mb]](/obvulihs/download/pdf/8889300?originalFilename=true)", "language": null, "image": "http://epub.jku.at/obvulihs/download/webcache/304/8893650", "pagetype": "book", "links": ["#leftParts", "#centerParts", "https://www.jku.at/bibliothek", "#", "#", "#", null, "/action/changeLanguage?lang=en", "https://epub.jku.at", "https://epub.jku.at", "/ULI", "/search", "/obvulihs/auth/login", null, "/nav/classification/110945", "/obvulihs/facet/type/nav/index/all", "/obvulihs/nav/history", "/nav/index/title", "/nav/index/name.aut", "/nav/index/name.asn", "/nav/cloud/keyword", "/nav/cloud/name.aut", "/nav/cloud/name.asn", "/obvulihs/wiki/students-info", "/obvulihs/wiki/user-info", "/obvulihs/wiki/document-upload", "/obvulihs/content/structure/8889300", "/obvulihs/content/thumbview/8893650", "/obvulihs/content/pageview/8893650", "/obvulihs/content/pageview/8893650", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=bib.personalName%3D%22Kling%2C%20Anna%20Maria%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=bib.personalName%3D%22Auer-Rizzi%2C%20Werner%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=(bib.originPlace%3D%22Linz%22)%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.date%3D%222023%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22Work-life%20balance%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22millennials%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22culture%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22expectations%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22cross-cultural%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22Austria%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22Canada%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22Taiwan%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22cultural%20dimensions%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22Confucian%20values%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22gender%20roles%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22technology%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22social%20media%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22global%20generation%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22work-life%20balance%20policies%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvulihs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22Linz%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvuli sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "http://d-nb.info/gnd/4074255-6", "/obvulihs/wiki/identifier/urnresolving?urn=urn:nbn:at:at-ubl:1-64074", "https://permalink.obvsg.at/ULI/AC16899480", "/obvulihs/download/pdf/8889300?originalFilename=true", "/nav/classification/110945", "/nav/classification/110990", "/nav/classification/111004", "/obvulihs/content/structure/8889300", "/obvulihs/doc/imprint", "http://www.semantics.de/produkte/visual_library/"]}
