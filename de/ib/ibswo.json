We must therefore advise cancer \npatients against relying on the curative effect of this method and highlight possible dangers which this \ntherapy may pose. \nClaims of the suppliers\nAccording to infor mation contained on a website2 in February 2001, Galavit has prolonged the survival time \nof patients suffering from cancer and markedly improved their quality of life. In many cases, the suppliers \nsay, the primary tumour has ceased growing and the growth o f metastases was able to be prevented. \nShortly after starting the therapy, more than 80% of patients had put on an average of 1.5 to 2kg in \nweight as is staded.\nIt has supposedly been proven that Galavit\n\u2013   reduces the side -effects of radio - and chemother apy,\n\u2013   stimulates macrophages, which results in increased interleukin production\n\u2013   modulates the basement membrane, thereby inducting a cellular immune reaction\n\u2013   modulates the cytotoxicity index of NK cells: high values were decreased and low values  were i n-\ncreased.\nAccording to the information on the Russian package circular Galavit inhibits the hyperactivity of macr o-\nphages, yet information from the Institut Harz states that Galavit activates the macrophages (quote a c-\ncording to 14).\nDiscovery\nThe me dicine is said to having been developed during Russian space research at the secret radiological \nresearch laboratory at Obinsk near Moscow6. Since then it has supposedly been successfully used on 300 \ncosmonauts and 30,000 cancer patients, in most cases as accompanying treatment to chemo - and radi o-\ntherapy\u00b9.\nAccording to other sources, Galavit originates from a \u00abproven American cancer therapy concept\u00bb13 (quote \naccording to 14).2Studies\nMedical databases do not currently contain any publications of case repor ts or clinical studies5,4,7, which \nsubstantiate the claims of suppliers with regard to the effectiveness of Galavit against cancer. Clinical stu d-\nies are supposedly being prepared at present, which should meet the scientific standard\u00b2.\nNeither is there any data available regarding the safety of Galavit, which permits a judgement to be made7. \nAt present both the Pharmaceutical Commission of the German Medical Profession as well as the German \nCancer Society [Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft e. V] and the German Soci ety of Oncology [Deutsche Gesel l-\nschaft f\u00fcr Onkologie]  are advising against using Galavit due to a lack of information on the product. The \nGerman Society of Oncology considers the current use of Galavit to be purely profit -oriented rather than \npatient -oriented15.\nIndications according to suppliers\nThe following indications are stated in the product information\u00b2: \u00abAcute and chronic infections and infla m-\nmatory diseases, opportunistic infections, urogenital infections, autoimmune disorders, allergic inflamm a-\ntory reactions, residual following traumatic and surgical operations, following radiotherapy, chemotherapy, \nimmunosuppressive and corticosteroid therapy.\u00bb According to information on the package circular, Galavit \ncan be used for \u00ab\u2026correction of immunity in t he pre - and post -surgical phase on cancer patients underg o-\ning radio - and chemotherapy treatment\u2026\u00bb.\nContraindications according to suppliers\u00b2\nPregnancy, incompatibility reactions\nSide -effects/adverse reactions according to suppliers\nThe information is of a contradictory nature: on the one hand, attention is drawn to the \u00abincreased effect \non sexual power\u00bb in individual cases. Avoid simultaneous use of other immunostimulatory medicines\u201d\u00b2. On \nthe other hand, according to the information on Galavit\u2019s\u201d package circular, there are neither known side -\neffects nor adverse reactions17.\nComponents/Effect\n2-amino -1,2,3,4 -tetrahydrophthalazin -1-4 dione -sodium salt; there are at present no studies which prove \nthe effect of this substance on cancer patients. The substanc e seems to be chemically very similar to lum i-\nnol18, which is used in immunological detection diagnosis; in a chemical reaction it gives off light. Luminol \ndust can trigger allergies. The water -insoluble solution must be disposed in accordance with the dire ctive \non dangerous substances.\nManufacture/Registration/Legal position\nThe drug was registered by the Russian Health Ministry in 1997 as galavit phthalhydrosid salt. The Russian \ncompany MEDICOR manufactures and markets the drug. As far as the German Cance r Society is aware, the \nlicensing procedure in Russia took place without the data being verified7. \nBoth the sale and advertising of Galavit are prohibited in Switzerland. The drug is not registered at Swis s-\nmedic, the Swiss Agency f\u00fcr Therapeutic Products.\nDosage2 \nOne 100mg Galavit ampoule to be administered intramuscularly daily, for five days, then only every two to \nthree days for three to four weeks, depending on the size and type of the tumour. Total number of inje c-\ntions recommended by the supplier: 1 5\u201320.3\nCosts\n15 ampoules taken over a period of three weeks cost the equivalent of between around CHF 8,300 and \n14,000\n1,2,14 \ndepending on the supplier in Germany. Reporters were able to purchase the drug, without a \nprescription, for the equivalent of arou\nnd CHF 17 per ampoule from a Moscow pharmacy.\nSuppliers/Patients\nMission Pharma AG, Basteiplatz 5, 8022 Zurich, www.galavit.at/Galavit/\nReferences:\n(1) \nwww.galavit.de\n(Stand 2/2001)\n(2) \nwww.galavit.com\n  (Stand 2/2001)\n(3) \nwww.galavitum.de\n  (Stand 2/2001)\n(4) \nwww.vrzverlag.com/esoterik/legalavi.htm\n(5) \nwww.arzneitelegramm.de\n \u00abGalavit gegen Krebs?\u00bb blitz\n-\na\n-\nt vom 25.10.2000\n(6) www.galavit.at/Galavit/index.html  (Stand 8/2001)\n(7) Stellungnahme der Deutschen Krebsgesellschaft e.V. zu \u00abalavit\n(8) \u00abRussisches \u2039Wundermittel\u203a aus der Weltraumfors\nchung.
