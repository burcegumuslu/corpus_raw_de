However, many of these activities in the laboratory can be automated to increase reproducibility and throughput - and thus relieve the workload on skilled personnel.\nOne example of such time- and labor-intensive laboratory processes is the propagation of stem cells. To reduce repetitive procedures for staff and avoid human error through interaction with cells, the Fraunhofer IPT offers solutions for automated cultivation of stem cells in the laboratory. Here, we refer to experiences from past and current projects in which we have developed fully automated laboratory facilities as well as partially automated facilities to produce stem cells for research and therapy.\nIt would be our pleasure to support you and provide you with recommendations for the development of fully and partially automated plant concepts as well as individual process automation in your laboratory. At this point, we focus on compliance with GMP/GAMP (Good Manufacturing Practice/Good Automated Manufacturing Practice) recommendations so that biological processes are carried out in accordance with these guidelines.\nWould you like to test your laboratory processes with us? StemCellDiscovery is a fully automated laboratory which is available as a testbed for cooperating universities and companies.\nOur services\n- Support in the automation of laboratory processes\n- Development of laboratory automation concepts (fully or partially automated)\n- Control system development and adaptation\n- System planning and commissioning\n- Automation and optimization of laboratory protocols\n[GMP-compliant design and construction](https://publicwiki-01.fraunhofer.de/GMP-konforme_Anlagenkonstruktion/index.php/Hauptseite) [Software for automated cell and gene
