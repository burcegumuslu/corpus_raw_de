However, currently only a small part of research focuses on the underlying mechanisms that are essential for the degradation or maintenance of the synthesized genes and proteins.\nIn the research group of Neurohomeostasis, we are concerned with the research of molecular biological and cell biological mechanisms that are important for maintaining the balance between the building up and degradation processes in the cell.\nAims of the Research Group\nThe research group has set itself the task of including the important and central process for maintaining the molecular balance of the cell as part of translational, neurobiological research in the field of psychiatry. Therefore, one of the core goals of the RG is, in close cooperation with psychiatrists and psychologists, to establish a causal connection between the observations resulting from the clinic and molecular biological and cellular processes. The knowledge gained will also be used to develop more targeted diagnoses and tailored therapies. In this way, questions from the clinic and biomarker studies are recorded, corresponding working models are created and hypothesis-driven molecular biological, biochemical, cellular and functional research is carried out.\nThe focus of this interdisciplinary group is the search and research of mechanisms that are relevant for the maintenance of neuronal and synaptic homeostasis. This includes various cellular processes:\n- autophagy (selective and non-selective autophagy),\n- lysosomal degradation mechanisms,\n- proteasomal degradation,\n- molecular chaperones,\n- DNA damage response.\nWith interdisciplinary project approaches and a wide range of methods, we answer psychiatric questions in order to decipher cellular processes in physiology and pathophysiology. The following clinical pictures are of particular interest:\n- Stress-associated diseases (depression, anxiety, trauma),\n- attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),\n- psychopharmacology,\n- alternative therapy options (ECT, VNS, sports, nutrition/diets) and\n- in particular comorbidities with links to other fields like metabolism, immune system, pathogen defense.\nOngoing projects with established collaboration partners such as the LDC in Dortmund, the Max Planck Institute for Psychiatry Munich and the Charit\u00e9 Berlin allow us to bring research findings back to the clinic, which corresponds to the guiding principle of translational research.\nOngoing Projects\nThe research group focuses in particular on the research of proteostasis (protein homeostasis) of neuro-psychiatric relevant proteins and organelles. We investigate the role of psychiatric diseases on the various selective and non-selective mechanisms for protein degradation.\nAnother strong project branch is psychopharmacology:\n- The influence of common psychopharmaceuticals on cellular mechanism for protein quality control is examined.\n- Novel strategies for pharmacological therapeutic approaches are gained and developed through newly acquired knowledge.\nEducation\nStudents from the fields of molecular biology, biochemistry, pharmacology or the neurosciences have the opportunity to work on the MSc, Dr. rer nat. or Dr. med. projects.\nResearch Group Leader\nDr. rer. nat.
