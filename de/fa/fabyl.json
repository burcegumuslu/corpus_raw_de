To maintain your\nhorse's fitness, health and proficiency,\nI have developed a comprehensive combination of care and preventive measures. They are based on the\nprinciple of keeping your horse under observation even before symptoms appear and responding promptly at the first signs of any imbalance. To this end I combine various different approaches in my veterinary practice: the millennia old Chinese medical tradition together with manual therapy and classical veterinary medicine. In view of the phenomenal successes which I have witnessed in recent years, I have become a wholehearted advocate of acupuncture and chiropractic - it is extremely gratifying to see how effectively horses can be helped using these techniques, often in cases which have already been given up as hopeless. The secret of success lies in the carefully tailored combination of acupuncture, acupressure, chiropractic, cranio-sacral therapy and laser therapy.", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["#skipNavigation22", "index.php/dr-astrid-reitz-en.html", "index.php/acupuncture.html", "index.php/seminar-en.html", "index.php/acupressure-dvd.html", "index.php/shop-en.html", "index.php/contact.html", "index.php/login-en.html", null, "index.php/index.html", "index.php/shop-en.html", "http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/equine-acupressure/id440973743?mt=8&ls=1", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dr-Astrid-Reitz-Tier%C3%A4rztlichen-Praxis-f%C3%BCr-Akupunktur-und-Chiropraktik/124199534346789", "http://dr-reitz-pressearbeit-fotoreportagen.blogspot.com/", "index.php/home.html", "index.php/contact.html", "index.php/impressum-en.html", "index.php/privacy-protection.html", "https://topimweb.com/referenzen.html"]}
