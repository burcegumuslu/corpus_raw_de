The claim is misleading; a top railway official told AFP in January 2020 that no specific space has been designated for Muslim prayer at the station in the photos; AFP also visited the specified platform this month and found no such designated prayer space.\nThe photos were published in\n[this](https://perma.cc/9PK3-TGKQ) Facebook post on January 2, 2020. The post has been shared more than 240 times.\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\nThe post\u2019s Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \"Muslims have captured a space of 50 yards by tying a rope between platform number 4 and 5 at the Old Delhi Railway Station and no one can go inside. This place is reserved for offering Islamic prayer and there are two-three trunks with \u2018prayer related stuff inside and no one is allowed to sit on it\u2019 written on them. Will the railway tell me under what law this place has been allotted to them? Are they intended to convert the railway platform into a mosque? This is an infiltration and it will go far if they were not removed from here.\u201d\nThe photos in the misleading posts show a board which displays daily times allotted for Muslim prayer (namaz).\nThe post also tagged the verified Facebook pages of Indian\n[Prime Minister Narendra Modi](https://www.facebook.com/narendramodi), the [Ministry of Railways](https://www.facebook.com/RailMinIndia) and the [Ministry of Home Affairs](https://www.facebook.com/HMOfficeIndia).\nThe photos have also been shared on Facebook\n[here](https://perma.cc/CLY2-V2TA), [here](https://perma.cc/8QAQ-FNJ5), [here](https://perma.cc/P3RK-QMJG) and [here](https://perma.cc/C529-S9ZY); and on Twitter [ here](https://perma.cc/5Q3B-V37K), [here](https://perma.cc/W8MX-L7KD), [here](https://perma.cc/YW9M-267F) and [here](https://perma.cc/RB39-2ZK2) alongside a similar claim.\nThe claim is misleading; Munindra Kumar Chaudhary, the\n[Old Delhi Railway Station](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Delhi+Junction/@28.6611247,77.2257518,17.25z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x390cfd0fb42bc66b:0x2f5243cc33d906c8!8m2!3d28.6606385!4d77.2271407)\u2019s Acting Superintendent, refuted the claim as \u201cbaseless\u201d speculation and said the photos in the post may be \u201ceight to nine years old.\u201d\n\u201cThis is absolutely baseless information and rumour,\u201d Chaudhary told AFP during an interview on January 8, 2020 at his office. \u201cThere is no such place or space designated from any religious ritual inside the station premises. There is only a meditation room for security personnel and other railway staff.\u201d\nAFP also visited the platforms named in the misleading Facebook post and did not find any such encroachment.\nBelow are photographs taken by AFP of the platform:\nAFP also found that the area photographed in the Facebook post now has metal benches fixed to the ground, another indication that the misleading photos were taken before this year.\nBelow is a comparison showing the empty space and an old concrete bench seen in the misleading photo (L) and the new metal benches seen on the platform and photographed by AFP (R):", "language": null, "image": "https://factcheck.afp.com/sites/default/files/styles/twitter_card/public/medias/factchecking/india/delhi9.png?itok=YOLuQnTb", "pagetype": "article", "links": ["#main-content", "/", "/contact", "/", "/about-afp", "/how-we-work", "/afps-editorial-and-ethical-standards", "https://factcheck.afp.com/afp-fact-checking-stylebook", "/node/87993/", "https://digitalcourses.afp.com/", "https://www.afp.com/en/products/afp-fact-check?utm_source=AFP_Factuel&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ALL-PDT-202212-Factcheck&utm_content=Menu", "https://factcheck.afp.com/contact", "/corrections", "/list/all/all/38643/all/6659", "/list/all/all/39405/all/2526", "/list/all/all/39289/all/2387", "/list/all/all/35799/all/86", "/list/all/all/38628/all/446", "/list/all/all/all/38558/19", "/list/all/all/all/38561/22", "/list/all/all/all/38560/20", "/list/all/all/all/38562/17", "/list/all/all/all/38559/21", "/list/all/all/all/38563/285", "/list/all/37075/all/all/80", "/list/all/37881/all/all/79", "/list/all/37074/all/all/82", "/list/all/37783/all/all/81", "/afp-india", null, null, null, "https://perma.cc/9PK3-TGKQ", "https://www.facebook.com/narendramodi", "https://www.facebook.com/RailMinIndia", "https://www.facebook.com/HMOfficeIndia", "https://perma.cc/CLY2-V2TA", "https://perma.cc/8QAQ-FNJ5", "https://perma.cc/P3RK-QMJG", "https://perma.cc/C529-S9ZY", "https://perma.cc/5Q3B-V37K", "https://perma.cc/W8MX-L7KD", "https://perma.cc/YW9M-267F", "https://perma.cc/RB39-2ZK2", "https://www.google.com/maps/place/Delhi+Junction/@28.6611247,77.2257518,17.25z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x390cfd0fb42bc66b:0x2f5243cc33d906c8!8m2!3d28.6606385!4d77.2271407", "/afp-india", "/afp-india", null, null, null, "http://u.afp.com/wRmn", "https://www.facebook.com/AFPFactCheck/", "https://twitter.com/AFPFactCheck", "https://www.instagram.com/afpfactcheck/", "/", "/about-afp", "/how-we-work", "/afps-editorial-and-ethical-standards", "https://factcheck.afp.com/afp-fact-checking-stylebook", "/node/87993/", "https://digitalcourses.afp.com/", "https://www.afp.com/en/products/afp-fact-check?utm_source=AFP_Factuel&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ALL-PDT-202212-Factcheck&utm_content=Menu", "https://factcheck.afp.com/contact", "/corrections", "https://www.afp.com/en/legal-information", "/"]}
