Between warming lattes, grounding root veggies, and pumpkin-everything, there\u2019s no shortage of nourishing fall foods to fill our plate. Best of all, these seasonal picks come with some serious immune-boosting properties! So of course, we had to whip up something delicious. And what could be better than a fall-inspired immune-supporting soup? Filled with superfood ingredients and all things nutritious, you\u2019ll want to savor every spoonful of this FitOn fall favorite.\nRELATED:\n[8 Nourishing Ways to Use Root Vegetables to Bring Comfort This Season](https://fitonapp.com/nutrition/root-vegetable-recipes/)\nImmune-Supporting Ingredients\nFirst, let\u2019s take a look at the ingredients that make this the ultimate nourishing immune-supporting soup.\nBone Broth\nDid you know a considerable portion of your immune system is contained within your gastrointestinal tract? Yep, a whopping\n[70%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515351/) of your immune system is housed within your gut. So, when it comes to building our natural defenses, it\u2019s safe to say gut health is important!\nThat\u2019s why we added bone broth to our immune-supporting soup. We know, we know \u2014 you\u2019ve probably heard all about the gut-supporting benefits of bone broth. But this trendy ingredient isn\u2019t just a wellness fad, science and research support the buzz! Bone broth is rich in the amino acid glutamine, which\n[studies](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323903#gut-health) have shown plays an important role in supporting our intestinal barrier. And now that we know a [large part of our immune system actually resides in the gut](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/research/advancements-in-research/fundamentals/in-depth/the-gut-where-bacteria-and-immune-system-meet), there\u2019s never been a better time to add some gut-supporting foods to our diet.\nClearly, our ancestors were on to something \u2014 there\u2019s a reason why Grammy\u2019s homemade soup always made us feel better! It may be thanks to the addition of nutrient-rich broth.\nGarlic\nGarlic has long been known for its immune-supporting properties, hence why you\u2019ll find lots of it in this immune-supporting soup.\n[Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4417560/) has shown that garlic may help support the immune system through stimulating important immune cells.\nIn fact, one\n[study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22280901/) found participants who ate 2.56 grams of aged garlic extract per day had a 60% reduction in duration of cold symptoms versus those who didn\u2019t eat any garlic.\nIn addition to enjoying garlic in this delicious immune-supporting soup, here are some other yummy ways to enjoy garlic this season.\n- Make homemade garlic bread using roasted garlic, gluten-free bread, and ghee (yum!)\n- Add minced garlic to homemade tomato sauce.\n- Try adding garlic to homemade salad dressings for an added flavor and nutrient boost.\nTurmeric\nLet\u2019s be honest, turmeric is the holy grail of spices. It\u2019s been shown to reduce inflammation, ease digestion, speed exercise recovery, and help our body function at its best. So, it should come as no surprise to learn this superfood is full of\n[immune-supporting](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17211725/#:~:text=Traditionally%20known%20for%20its%20an,killer%20cells%2C%20and%20dendritic%20cells.) benefits!\nThanks to curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, this superstar spice has powerful anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and medicinal properties.\nAnd a little fun fact for you: black pepper (or rather, piperine, black pepper\u2019s active compound) increases the bioavailability of curcumin by up to\n[2000](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9619120/)%. Excuse me, what!? Yes, you read that correctly! Curcumin is [poorly absorbed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26007179/) by the bloodstream, meaning it needs a little assistance in order for your body to absorb all of turmeric\u2019s powerful immune-supporting benefits. As you can see, we strategically added a little black pepper to the mix when creating our immune-supporting soup recipe below! So, if you\u2019re going to modify any ingredients, try not to skimp on this spice \ud83d\ude42\nImmune-Supporting Ingredient Add-Ins\nWant to supercharge your immune system even further? Here are additional immune-supporting ingredients that can be incorporated into this nourishing bone broth soup, or any recipe of your choice!\nGinger: Like turmeric, this spice is an\n[anti-inflammatory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665023/) super-herb that also adds a delicious fall flavor to any soup you add it to.\nCinnamon: Cinnamon does more than add a hint of sweetness to your dish! Sprinkle it on any recipe for a powerful\n[antioxidant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4003790/) and anti-inflammatory boost.\nKale: Rich in Vitamins A, C, and K, plus powerful phytonutrients, kale is an immune-supporting veggie worth incorporating.\nAnti-inflammatory Immune-Supporting Bone Broth Pumpkin Soup\nReady to make a batch of this nourishing soup to not only help show your immune system some love but also satisfy all those comfort food cravings? Not only is this soup easy to make, but it\u2019s also:\n- Dairy-free\n- Gluten-free\n- Soy-free\nIngredients:\n- 3 cloves of garlic, chopped\n- 1 small yellow onion, chopped\n- 4 cups chicken, turkey, or beef bone broth\n- \u00bd cup pure pumpkin puree\n- \u00bd tsp ground turmeric\n- 1 cup full-fat unsweetened coconut milk\n- Sea salt & cracked black pepper to taste\n- Coconut oil for cooking\nInstructions:\nStep #1: Add the coconut oil to a large stockpot over low/medium heat and add the chopped garlic and onion. Saute for about 3 minutes.\nStep #2: Add the broth, pumpkin, and turmeric, and bring to a boil.
