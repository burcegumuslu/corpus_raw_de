Micro and macro analyses of the energy input and detailed consumption structures are conducted; all consumers (e.g. buildings, traffic, industrial processes etc.) are aggregated to obtain energy consumption data of city districts and the entire complex. In addition, several packages of measures are being developed to improve the energy performance, focusing on service processes. The aim is to reduce the energy demand of the City of Stuttgart by about 20 percent within the next 10 years.\nDeveloping an energy concept for the urban energy transition\nA macroscopic balance model was developed to document the current situation. This model provides the basis for an energy concept and serves as a monitoring tool. Moreover, a microscopic balance and strategy model was conceived for the private household sector. It is used as an agent-based simulation tool for analyzing the impact of potential measures, external effects and trends. Besides, optimization potentials were identified and estimated, from which options for appropriate action were derived for politicians and society. Finally, an 'Energy Road Map 2050', presenting different development scenarios, was prepared as a tool to support the municipality in decision-making.\nFurther, IBP experts have developed, provided and validated advisory services for households with regard to the energy use of buildings, mobility and household electricity, energy-relevant behavior and decisions. To support the retrofitting process, IBP experts also developed several services, ranging from initial consulting and quality assurance to contracting models and energy management.\nProject results\n- An MS Excel-based macroscopic balance calculation tool which can be transferred to other cities\n- A dedicated microscopic balance calculation and strategy tool for Stuttgart\n- An inventory containing assessments of potential for 101 measures\n- Development scenarios and an Energy Road Map for Stuttgart\n- A server-based household consulting tool (including a portfolio) for Stuttgart\n- A portfolio for retrofitting services (including pilot applications) in Stuttgart\n- An energy register, providing the basis for an energy master plan in Stuttgart\nPartnering institutions in the project work include:\n- Landeshauptstadt Stuttgart (Amt f\u00fcr Umweltschutz)\n- Energie Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg AG (EnBW)\n- Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart mit den Instituten ISV, IEV, ISWA, IER und ZIRIUS\nFunding agency\n- The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), ref.: FKZ: 03SF0405\nFor further information (Only German), please refer to:\n[Internetportal zum
