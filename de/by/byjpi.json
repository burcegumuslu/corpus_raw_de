CONCLUSION AND DEMANDS  18\n6. BIBLIOGRAPHY  20\n7. ANNEX  22|  THE BUSINESS WITH JOINTS4\n1. THE PROBLEM\nBoth glucosamine and chondroitin are natural elements \nfound in connective tissue, cartilage and sinovial fluid \nin the human body. They are also present in foods, but \nare not nutrients and have no nutritional value. After \nvitamins and minerals, food supplements contain -\ning glucosamine and chondroitin are amongst the \nfrequently sold food supplements. According to informa -\ntion from health service provider IMS Health, consumers \nin 2012 spent over EUR 100 million on over-the-counter \nmedicinal products and food supplements containing \nglucosamine, chondroitin, hyaluronic acid, green lipped \nmussel powder or gelatine [1]. The enquiries on the \nwebsite of the consumer associations (CA) www.klar -\ntext-nahrungsergaenzung.de demonstrate that consum -\ners require verified information on food supplements for \njoints. At 40%, most illness-related enquiries relate to \nthis product group.\nIt is questionable whether these substances protect \nagainst osteoarthritis or the loss of cartilage. Their incor -\nporation into cartilage and the positive effect are also \nunclear. The ability for cartilage to regenerate itself is \nfundamentally regarded as extremely low to impossible.\nAccording to current studies, the effects of glucosamine \nor chondroitin in both food supplements and medici -\nnal products are contradictory [2-4]. While some studies \nshow a slight improvement in symptoms, in many others \nthere is no demonstrable difference compared to taking \na placebo [5]. In a current Spanish study from 2017 , the \nplacebo actually had an even stronger effect in treating \npain in the case of osteoarthritis of the knee than the \ncombination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulphate \n[6]. In its guidelines, Osteoarthritis Research Society \nInternational records that products with glucosamine \nand chondroitin do not deliver any benefits in the treat -\nment of osteoarthritis of the knee joint [7]. The new \nclinical practice guideline of the American Academy of \nOrthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) also advises against the \nuse of glucosamine sulphate in the treatment of patients \nwith osteoarthritis of the hip. Reason for this: The avail -\nable evidence demonstrates no benefit compared to \nplacebo preparations with regard to an improvement in \nfunctionality, reduction of stiffness and easing of pain \n[8].For years, glucosamine and chondroitin were promoted \nas \"joint nutrients\" with suggestions such as \"to build \ncartilage\" or \"for mobility\". Health-related promotion for \nglucosamine and chondroitin has been prohibited by law \nsince 2013 (Commission Regulation (EU) 1066/2013), \nafter the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) classified \nas not scientifically proven the link between consump -\ntion of these substances and the proposed health claims \nattributed to them. Those claims included such state -\nments as: \"contributes to maintaining the normal function \nof joint cartilage\" and \"contributes to the protection of \njoint cartilage when there is excessive movement or load \nand to improved mobility of the joints\". The EFSA added \nto this assessment that there was no scientific proof that \nglucosamine and/or chondroitin have a preventive effect \nin maintaining the structure or functioning of the joints or \ncartilage of healthy people.\nAside from their questionable benefits, taking products \nthat contain glucosamine or chondroitin can even carry \nhealth risks [9-11].\n\u2022 Food supplements containing glucosamine and \nchondroitin can be a health risk to patients who are \ntaking anticoagulants (coumarin anticoagulants) \nbecause the two substances can increase the \nblood-thinning effect of the drugs and thus cause \nbleeding. When taking glucosamine, there is also \nthe risk of hypercholesterolemia.\n\u2022 More specifically, people who suffer from diabetes \nmellitus also have limited glucose tolerance and \nshould monitor their blood glucose levels when \ntaking glucosamine, as it can interact with the \nmetabolism of glucose (e.g. the functionality of the \ninsulin-producing pancreas cells can be inhibited).\n\u2022 People who suffer from an allergy to crustaceans/\nshellfish should watch out for corresponding aller -\ngen labelling, because glucosamine is frequently \nmade from these creatures. There is also a risk for \npeople who are allergic to fish in the case of prod -\nucts containing chondroitin from fish tissue.THE BUSINESS WITH JOINTS | 5\n\u2022 According to the German Federal Institute for Risk \nAssessment (Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Risikobewertung \u2013 \nBfR), it is not possible to evaluate the health risks of \ntaking glucosamine or chondroitin for pregnant \nwomen and nursing mothers, nor for children and \nyoung people, due to a lack of data. \nMany consumers believe that taking glucosamine or \nchondroitin products promotes health. The manufac -\nturers enhance these beliefs through active promotion \nand the use of, in some cases, questionable statements \nor images. But food supplements are not intended to \nprevent, alleviate or cure illnesses. This is the function \nof medicinal products, which have been tested for effec -\ntiveness and safety and approved by the authorities \nprior to going on sale.\nHealth claims about the effect of nutrients or other \nsubstances are not permitted in the area of joints. \nAccording to a current ruling by the working group of \nfood chemistry experts from the German federal states \n(ALS) and by the Federal Office of Consumer Protection \nand Food Safety (BVL), using the term \"joint\" in prod -\nuct names, advertising improved joint functionality \nand showing a moving joint are not permitted, as this \nassumes a cause-effect relationship which, according \nto expert opinion, is not the case [12]. An image of this \nkind would signify an unlawful extension of the approved \nhealth claims. This also applies to claims that are in fact \npermitted for vitamins and/or minerals with regard to \nconnective tissue, cartilage or bones if they are used in \nrelation to joints. Despite this, numerous joint products \ncontain the addition of vitamin C or zinc, on which the \nadvertising is then based.\n2.  AIM OF THE MARKET \nREPORT\nThe consumer associations' market report focused on \nthe large market segment of food supplements contain -\ning glucosamine and chondroitin which are offered for \njoints. The experts evaluated the products available both \nfrom bricks-and-mortar retailers and via the internet and \nexamined direct sales as an example. The aim was to \ncheck whether the products could pose a health concern \ndue to their composition. The market report also focused \non the labelling and promotional statements.3. APPROACH\nThe market report was carried out in the period between \nMarch and April 2017. A total of 25 freely available \nproducts were included and examined more closely in \nrespect of the criteria stated in the objectives. 14 prod -\nucts came from bricks-and-mortar retailers (pharmacies, \nchemist's shops, discount stores, fitness shops, health \nstores, supermarkets), while 11 products were obtained \nvia the internet.\nThe BfR maximum dose recommendations for vitamins \nand minerals in food additives and the nutrient reference \nvalues (NRV) from the Food Labelling Regulation were \nused to evaluate the micro-nutrient content. The BfR's \nrecommendations take into account the supply situa -\ntion in Germany and the risk involved in consuming too \nmuch of individual substances. These BfR recommenda -\ntions for the maximum daily dose of individual vitamins \nand minerals in food additives are not legally bind -\ning and the manufacturers are therefore not obliged to \ncomply with them [13, 14]. However, they help consum -\ners to buy products safely. The nutrient reference values \nthat apply across the EU (relating to healthy adults) for \nthe daily consumption of vitamins and minerals pursu -\nant to the Food Information for Consumers Regulation \n(EU FIC) include consumption via daily food and drink as \nwell as via food supplements [15]. Vitamins and miner -\nals contained in food supplements must be stated on the \npackaging as a percentage of the NRV.\nIt is particularly worth noting the consumption of 1,250 \nmg of glucosamine per day, which is considered to be \npharmacologically effective by the European Medicines \nAgency (EMA) [9] and which corresponds to a dose of \n1,584 mg of glucosamine sulphate. According to this, \nfood supplements with a daily dose of at least 1,250 mg \nof glucosamine should be judged to be medicinal prod -\nucts. Other scientists already consider around half this \nvalue to be pharmacologically effective [16]. Because \ncurrent data leads us to conclude that daily consumption \nof 800 mg of chondroitin sulphate can be pharmacolog -\nically effective [17 , 18], this reference value was used to \nevaluate the food supplements.\nThe consumer associations also tested the promotional \ntechniques used for this product group. In doing so, \nparticular focus was put on the wording and the legality \nof the health claims used. Complete and correct label -\nling of warning messages was also checked. In the case |  THE BUSINESS WITH JOINTS6\nof goods from bricks-and-mortar retailers, they analysed \nthe promotional claims made on the packaging. Claims \non the insert leaflet or the inner packaging were not \nincluded in this, as they are not visible to consumers \nwhen making a decision at point of purchase and thus \nnot significant when making a purchase. To evaluate the \nhealth claims made by the online products, information \nboth on the product (to the extent that images were visi -\nble) and claims from the online product description were \nused. \n4.  RESULTS\n4.1  COMPOSITION AND DOSE\nThe market report made by the consumer asso -\nciations presents the situation in the segment of food \nsupplements containing glucosamine and chondroitin. \nIn addition to glucosamine and chondroitin, the main \nother ingredients were vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, copper \nand manganese. In the case of food additives bought \nonline, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), an organic \nsulphur compound, was also involved.\n4.1.1 Doses frequently too high\nAs there are no legally stipulated maximum doses for \nglucosamine and chondroitin, the following doses were \nused as a basis in the evaluation:\n\u2022 Glucosamine sulphate 1,584 mg (EMA measure -\nment) [9]\n\u2022 Chondroitin sulphate 800 mg (measurement accord -\ning to current studies) [17 , 18]\nAccording to us products with a higher content and corre -\nsponding pharmacological effect should not be permit -\nted to be food additives.\nGlucosamine sulphate with a possible pharmacolog -\nical dosage was found in the case of three products \nfrom online retailers. The highest recommended daily \ndose was 2,400 mg of glucosamine sulphate (Fig. 1). In \nthe case of other products, 2,000 mg was stated as the \nrecommendation. Consuming 2,000 mg of glucosamine \nsulphate per day is the equivalent of consuming 1,571 \nmg of glucosamine. In addition, three further food \nsupplements obtained online and one product from a \nbricks-and-mortar retailer with a daily recommenda -\ntion of 1,500 mg of glucosamine sulphate (equivalent to 1,178 mg of glucosamine) were close to being in the \nstated pharmacological range (Annex 1 and 2).\nFour online products and one food supplement from a \nbricks-and-mortar pharmacy had a daily recommended \ndose of 800 mg and 1,200 mg, respectively (Fig. 2). \nThese high daily doses of chondroitin sulphate could \nmean that these five products were pharmacologically \neffective [17 , 18].\nMSM had been added, mainly for products obtained \nonline \u2013 nine products contained this additive (Fig. 2), \nwhile this was only the case for one product from a bricks-\nand-mortar retailer. According to manufacturers' promo -\ntional claims, this substance is meant to help in the \ncase of inflammation, osteoarthritis and skin diseases, \nand even protect against cancer. However, these effects \nhave not been scientifically proven sufficiently for them \nto be used for promotional purposes and as recommen -\ndations. Due to a lack of approved health claims, manu -\nfacturers are not permitted to make promotional health \nclaims about MSM. Therefore, health claims of this kind \nare mainly found not on the products themselves, but on \nvarious websites. The reason is still given as a (non-exist -\nent) lack of sulphur.\n4.1.2  Doses of vitamins and minerals too \nhigh\nTaking a closer look at the purchased products, our \nattention was drawn to combinations with other miner -\nals, vitamins and additives. All 14 food supplements \nobtained from bricks-and-mortar retailers and four from \nonline retailers were also enriched with vitamins and/\nor minerals. For example, the products from bricks-and-\nmortar retailers had a total of 78 additional individual \nsubstances. Eleven out of 14 products from bricks-and-\nmortar retailers and three out of eleven from online \nretailers exceeded BfR recommendations for vitamins \nand minerals. A comparison with the NRV shows that \nnine products from bricks-and-mortar retailers and two \nfrom online retailers exceeded the NRV for at least one \nvitamin or mineral (Tab. 1). Food additives from bricks-\nand-mortar retailers most frequently exceeded the BfR \nrecommendations for zinc, copper, manganese, vitamin \nD and vitamin E. For products from online retailers, this \nwas the case for zinc, selenium, vitamin E and manga -\nnese. The following distribution resulted when using \nthe NRVs: Products from bricks-and-mortar retailers \nmost frequently contained too high levels of vitamin E, THE BUSINESS WITH JOINTS | 7\nfollowed by too high levels of vitamin B6. In the case of \nproducts from online retailers, there was no difference \ncompared to the BfR recommendations, with the excep -\ntion of vitamin C in one product (Annexes 1 and 2).\nThe consumer associations were particularly critical of \nthe high doses of vitamins and minerals, particularly in \nthe case of food supplements from bricks-and-mortar \nretailers (Fig. 3).\n\u2022 Two food supplements from bricks-and-mortar \nretailers and one product from an online retailer \ncontained too high daily doses of vitamin E. For \nexample, in the case of one product from a phar -\nmacy, the daily dose of 40 mg (Fig. 3) was \n267 percent higher than the BfR recommendation \nfor food supplements of 15 mg per day. Some scien -\ntific studies indicate that taking antioxidants \u2013 also \nincluding vitamin E \u2013 in the form of food supple -\nments could, in certain circumstances, also have \nnegative, converse effects (e.g. possible negative \nimpact on lifetime and on muscular stamina and \nstrength) [19-24].\n\u2022 Too high doses of vitamin D of 20 \u00b5g per day were \nfound in two products from bricks-and-mortar retail -\ners (Fig. 4). Based on the BfR's assessment, this \npresents a health risk, as too high levels of vitamin \nD could lead to headaches, nausea and loss of \nappetite, and in the worst case, even to kidney calci -\nfication and the formation of kidney stones.\n\u2022 Of particular note in the product range from bricks-\nand-mortar retailers was Glucosamin-Spe -\nzialkapseln (daily dose of 20 mg) with a dose of \nmanganese 20 times higher than that recommended \nby the BfR for food supplements (Fig. 5). Too much \nmanganese may have a negative effect on the \nuptake of iron. Vegetarians or people with iron defi -\nciency need to pay particular attention to this. \nUnspecific complaints, such as increased perspira -\ntion, tiredness and dizziness are potential side \neffects of a daily intake of 20 mg or more of manga -\nnese [25].\n\u2022 Of note was a product from an online retailer with a \nhigh dose of both zinc and selenium (Fig. 6). Long-\nterm consumption of too high a quantity of zinc (\u2265 \n25 mg/day) can, for example, lead to disturbance in the balance of copper and iron, and in the immune \nfunction and fat metabolism [26].\nOther additives:\nIn isolated cases, the tested food supplements contained \nother additives, such as hyaluronic acid, collagen and \ngreen lipped mussel extract (\"contains glycosaminogly -\ncans\"). Hyaluronic acid, collagen and glycosaminogly -\ncans are naturally occurring substances in cartilage, but \nthere is no safe evidence that they can find their way to \nthe cartilage when taken as a food supplement and then \nrebuild it [27]. Fish oil and spices such as turmeric and \nginger were also found in two products. They can actually \nact as positive additions to a normal diet, but there is no \nsafe scientific proof that they have a positive effect on \njoints when taken as a food supplement.\nExtensive information on individual substances that are \ntouted to help joints, connective tissue and bones, such \nas omega-3 fatty acids, frankincense extract or turmeric \ncan be found online at www.klartext-nahrungsergaen -\nzung.de .\nDuty of disclosure:\nFrom a legal perspective, food additives are foods and \nare not subject to an approval process. Before being \nlaunched onto the market, they must be disclosed to the \nFederal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety \n(BVL). It is sufficient to state the name of the product \nand of the responsible person (manufacturer, retailer or \nimporter) and to include a sample of the label.|  THE BUSINESS WITH JOINTS8\nSome manufacturers do not comply with this duty of \ndisclosure. A request to the BVL showed that nine of \nthe total of 25 products could not be found in the BVL's \ndatabase. This involved two products from bricks-and-\nmortar retailers and seven products from online retailers \n(Annexes 1 and 2).\nFigure 1: Composition of a food supplement from an \nonline retailer with a high recommended daily dose of \nglucosamine sulphate, where 2,400 mg of glucosamine \nsulphate equates to around 1,885 mg of glucosamine \n(Gelenk Mix Aktiv) \nFigure 2: Composition of a food supplement from \nan online retailer with a high recommended dose \nof glucosamine sulphate, chondroitin sulphate and \nmethylsulfonylmethane (Nutriza Select Glucosamine \nChondroitin MSM)\nType of business Number of products \nenriched with vita-\nmins and mineralsNumber of products exceeding the BfR's \nrecommended maximum daily dose in \nfood additives [13, 14].Number of products that exceed \nthe NRV reference value for daily \nvitamin and mineral consump-\ntion [15].\nBricks-and-mortar \nretailers14 11 9\nOnline 4 3 2\nTable 1: Product fortified with vitamins and minerals \u2013 subdivided by exceeding BfR and NRVTHE BUSINESS WITH JOINTS | 9\nFigure 3: Composition of a food supplement from a bricks-and-mortar retailer with a high recommended daily dose \nof vitamin C, vitamin E and zinc (Nobilin Gelenk Aktiv)\nFigure 4: Composition of a food supplement from a bricks-and-mortar retailer with a high recommended daily dose \nof vitamin D (tetesept Gelenk 1200 intens plus).

It \nalso recorded what additional promotional claims were \nused in the case of products ordered online.\n4.2.1 Target groups for promotion\nHalf of the products (seven of the 14 products) from \nbricks-and-mortar retailers used words, graphics or \nimages to address one or more target groups. Athletes \nwere most frequently named or depicted (on six prod -\nucts), followed by claims or images relating to elderly \npeople (five products). Stress on the joints due to over -\nweight was referenced on four products. Out of the \nseven products that did not name or depict a target \ngroup, five products carried the image of a joint.\nIn the case of products from online retailers, three of \nthe eleven products addressed a specific target group. \nThese established a reference to athletes. In compari -\nson to bricks-and-mortar retailers, online products were \nmore frequently advertised in general terms. In particu -\nlar, it was suggested that people who suffer from pain \nwould experience relief by taking the product. Out of \neight products that did not address a specific target \ngroup, a joint or painful arm was depicted on six prod -\nucts (Fig. 8).\n      \nFigure 8: Examples of joint images on the packaging \n(ZeinPharma Gelenk-Kapseln and Biomenta Gelenk -\nkomplex forte)4.2.2  Promotions using health promises\nThe Health Claims Regulation (HCVO) together with the \npositive list regulates which health claims are permitted \non foods and the conditions under which they may be \nused to promote products [28, 29].\nOnly two products from bricks-and-mortar retailers make \ndo with absolutely no health claims. A total of 114 health \nclaims were found on the other 12 products (on average \n9.5 claims per product). \nOut of 11 health supplements from online retailers, all \nused health claims to promote the product. A total of \n60 health claims were found: on average 5.5 claims per \nproduct. Some claims were only found in the descrip -\ntions of the products obtained online.\nMost health claims were found on the back of the rele -\nvant product, or in the description in the case of the \nonline products.\nIn the case of the food supplements obtained from bricks-\nand-mortar retailers, the health claims mainly related to \nvitamins or minerals \u2013 most frequently vitamin C and zinc. \nAs health claims relating to glucosamine or chondroitin \nare not permitted, some providers have moved to using \npermitted claims for vitamins and minerals (provided \nthey contain 13 per cent of the NRV), for example:\n\u2022 Vitamin C and/or zinc \"contributes to normal \n collagen formation for the normal function of \n cartilage\" or \n\u2022 Vitamin C and/or zinc \"contributes to the mainte -\nnance of normal bones\"\nHowever, a direct reference to joints is not permitted [12].\nThings are different for the promotion of online prod -\nucts. Here, the health claims predominantly relate to \nthe entire product and/or to glucosamine or chondroitin \ncompounds. These claims are not permitted under the \nHCVO.|  THE BUSINESS WITH JOINTS12\nChecking all the claims against the specifications in \nthe HCVO showed that 73 per cent, i.e. 44 out of 60 \nhealth claims on products from online retailers, were \nnot approved under the HCVO (Fig. 9). For products from \nbricks-and-mortar retailers this was only two per cent.\n51% 47% \n2% 2% 25% 73% \nBricks-and-\nmortar retailers\n(in percent)\nEvaluation of the health claims\n(Total statements: bricks-and-mortar retailers n = 114, online retailers n = 60)\nOnline retailers\n(in percent)\nApproved claims Require legal\nclari/f_ication/\nunlawful in\nCA\u2019s viewDe/f_initely not\npermitted claims\nFigure 9: Evaluation of the health claims on food supplements containing glucosamine and chondroitin.\n* In the opinion of the consumer associations, these health claims are unlawful as they do not comply with the requirements of the\n   Health Claims Regulation. The legitimacy of these formulation variations has not yet been legally clarified.THE BUSINESS WITH JOINTS | 13\nEspecially in the case of online products, the breaches \nare clear and frequent. And so, for example, the follow -\ning was promoted:\n -\"For joint complaints\u2026\" (Fig. 10),\n -\"Combats osteoarthritis and joint pain\",\n -\"Glucosamine can bring relief in the case of slight \nto moderate osteoarthritis (joint deterioration), \nsuch as in the case of joint swelling or joint stiff -\nness.\" or\n -\"Chondroitin helps in the formation of sinovial \nfluid and also inhibits inflammation.\"\nFigure 10: Examples of unlawful health claims (eubiopur \nArthro Plus and Vital Flex Pro)\nFurther examples of unlawful health claims with the \ncorresponding product reference are listed in Annexes \n3 and 4. \nProducts from bricks-and-mortar retailers were also \npromoted using unlawful health claims. In the case of \ntwo products, these claims related to several substances \nalthough they are not permitted for all of them (Fig. 11).\nFigure 11: \"Connective tissue\" health claim only permit -\nted for copper and manganese, but not for vitamin C \n(McMed Gelenk Depot Tabletten)\nIn the opinion of the consumer associations, a further 69 \nhealth claims should be subject to legal scrutiny. These \nare classified in Figure 9 as \"require legal clarification/\nunlawful in CA's view\".\nKey examples that led to this conclusion were:\n\u2022 Elements of permitted claims missing: The word \n\"normal\" as part of the permitted claim was missing \nparticularly often, e.g. in \"contributes to maintaining \nnormal connective tissue\". The health claims \"Vita -\nmin C contributes to normal collagen formation for \nthe normal function of cartilage\" and \"Vitamin C \ncontributes to normal collagen formation for the \nnormal function of bones and cartilage\" were often \nshortened to \"Vitamin C supports the normal func -\ntion of bones and cartilage\" or similar sounding \nclaims (Fig. 12).\nFigure 12: Shortened health claims (tetesept Gelenk \n1200 intens plus) |  THE BUSINESS WITH JOINTS14\nThe following claims are permitted under the HCVO:\nVitamin C contributes to normal collagen formation for \nthe normal function of cartilage.\nVitamin C contributes to normal collagen formation for \nthe normal function of bones.\n\u2022 Generalised claims that do not name a specific \nsubstance: In the case of products from online \nretailers, general or unspecific claims were \nfrequently made, such as \"important for cartilage\" or \n\"for highly stressed joints\". The consumer associa -\ntions consider it insufficient if the substance that is \nintended to achieve the stated effect is not named \ndirectly next to this information. Asterisked claims \non the front of the product relating to information \ngiven, for example, on the reverse, does not \ncompensate for this (Fig. 13). \nFigure 13: Insufficient asterisked information\nrelating to health claims from the consumer\nassociations' standpoint (Gelenk Komplex Dr. Wolz)\u2022 Highlighting a particular site of action: Extending a \nclaim to a specific site of action is also unlawful. For \nexample, instead of referring generally to cartilage, \nthe reference was made to joint cartilage (Fig. 14): \nFigure 14: Promotional statement on the front of a \nfood supplement containing glucosamine, where a\nspecific site of action (joint cartilage) is highlighted \n(McMed Gelenk Depot Tabletten)\nUnder the HCVO, only the following claim is permitted:\nVitamin C contributes to normal collagen formation for \nthe normal function of cartilage.\nOnly the health claims on the products were used to vali -\ndate \"highlighting a specific site of action (joint)\". \nThe ALS also evaluated the use of approved health \nclaims for vitamins and minerals in combination with \nthe product names. In Opinion No 2016/42, the food \nchemistry experts came to the view that using an actual \napproved claim (e.g. \"Vitamin C contributes to normal \ncollagen formation for the normal function of cartilage\") \nin connection with a product name that contains the term \n\"joints\" (e.g. \"Gelenkkapseln\" (joint capsules), \"Gelenk -\ndepot\" (joint store) or \"Gelenkkomplex\" (joint complex)), \nor depicting a moving joint, was unlawful [12].\nTHE BUSINESS WITH JOINTS | 15\n4.2.3 \"Free from\" promotion\nAt least one \"free from\" promotion which was marketed \nas being of additional health value was found on ten \nout of 14 products from bricks-and-mortar retailers and \non five out of eleven from online retailers. In the case of \nthe products from bricks-and-mortar retailers, the most \nfrequent offers were \"gluten free\" and \"lactose free\" (or \nwording with the same meaning). Products from online \nretailers mainly indicated that they were free from genet -\nically modified organisms.\n4.3  MANDATORY AND RECOMMENDED \nINFORMATION\nThe market report also aimed to check whether the infor -\nmation stipulated by law and recommended by the BfR \nwas present and correctly labelled on the food supple -\nments from bricks-and-mortar and online retailers \ncontaining glucosamine and chondroitin.\n4.3.1 Warning and usage information\nAccording to paragraph 4 of the Health Claims Regulation \n(NemV), food additives must be labelled with the follow -\ning information [30]:\n\u2022 Food additives should not be used as a substitute \nfor a balanced and varied diet and a healthy life -\nstyle.\n\u2022 Do not exceed the stated recommended dose.\n\u2022 Keep out of the reach of small children.\nThe information was found to be correct and legible on \nall preparations from bricks-and-mortar retailers.\nIn the case of products from online retailers, atten -\ntion was paid to those details that were obvious when \nmaking the purchase decision, i.e. on the product photo \nor in the product description. All the required informa -\ntion was found on ten food supplements. One product \nwas missing the information on dose and the informa -\ntion on a balanced diet.4.3.2  Information for specific consumer \ngroups\nFood supplements containing glucosamine or chondroi -\ntin can be problematic for people with diabetes mellitus \nor limited glucose tolerance, people who are allergic to \ncrustaceans, and for patients who are taking anticoag -\nulants (coumarin or warfarin). Due to a lack of data, it is \nnot possible to assess the health value of an intake of \nglucosamine or chrondoitin for pregnant women or nurs -\ning mothers [9-11]. Therefore, for precautionary reasons, \nthe BfR considers it a requirement to put corresponding \ninformation on food supplement labels, and manufactur -\ners should include these in order to increase safe usage. \nUnfortunately, with the exception of allergen labelling \nand the provisions relating to specific substances listed \nin Annex 3 of the EU FIC, this information is not required \nby law. But the EU FIC provides the framework for such \ninformation via Article 4, para. 1b(i) and manufactur -\ners should use this. However, such information was not \npresent on all checked products. Table 2 provides an \noverview.\nThere was no significant difference between the food \nsupplements from bricks-and-mortar retailers and online \nretailers. We noted one product from a bricks-and-mortar \nretailer (pharmacy) which did not carry any of the infor -\nmation (Fig. 5).\nInformation for... products \nfrom bricks-\nand-mortar \nretailers \nn=14products \nfrom\nonline \nretailers\nn=11\nDiabetics/people with limited \nglucose tolerance11 8\nPeople who are taking anticoag -\nulant drugs11 8\nPeople allergic to crustaceans \nor fish13* 11\nPregnant women and nursing \nmothers8 9\n* This missing information suggests that no ingredients from \ncrustaceans or fish were used.\nTable 2: Information for specific consumer groups|  THE BUSINESS WITH JOINTS16\n4.3.3 Other usage information\nThe following claim was found on the website for \none food supplement (Vital Flex Pro): \"In addition, \nglucosamine sulphate has no side effects \u2013 even when \nused long-term. It can therefore be used with confidence \nfor preventive purposes. Glucosamine sulphate can be \nadministered for an unlimited time. In contrast to pain -\nkillers, it is free from any side effects.\"\nThis information is false and also supports consumers' \nnotions that food supplements are completely harm -\nless and, in contrast to medicinal products, cannot have \nany side effects. For example, if food supplements and \ndrugs are taken at the same time, there can be recipro -\ncal effects. The effect of drugs can also be inhibited or \nintensified.\n4.4 WIDE RANGE OF PRICES\n \nWhen calculating the costs of food supplements contain -\ning glucosamine, we noticed some marked differences. \nIn bricks-and-mortar retailers, the prices of the acquired \nproducts ranged from EUR 0.16 to EUR 1.00 for the \nmanufacturer's recommended daily dose. On average, \nconsumers can expect to pay between EUR 0.39 and \naround EUR 142 per year for these products. In online \nretailers, the average spend per daily dose of EUR 0.58 \nand annual spend of around EUR 211 were significantly \nhigher. Here the daily costs ranged between EUR 0.33 \nand EUR 1.10 (Figs. 15 and 16). The prices varied enor -\nmously, even when the ingredients were almost identi -\ncal. Consequently, the differences did not permit any \nconclusions to be drawn on the quality of the products. \n \n \n 00,20,40,60,811,2Price in Euro    Daily price range  \n   \n020040060080010001200Price in Euro       \n   Bricks-and-mortar retailers Online retailers(as per recommended daily dose)\nBricks-and-mortar retailers Online retailersAnnual price range\n(as per recommended daily dose)Figure 15: Daily price range of the documented food \nsupplements \n \n \n 00,20,40,60,811,2Price in Euro    Daily price range  \n   \n020040060080010001200Price in Euro       \n   Bricks-and-mortar retailers Online retailers(as per recommended daily dose)\nBricks-and-mortar retailers Online retailersAnnual price range\n(as per recommended daily dose)\nFigure 16: Annual price range of the acquired food \nsupplementsTHE BUSINESS WITH JOINTS | 17\n4.5 MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING \nMulti-level marketing (MLM) is a special form of direct \ndistribution that is established on multiple levels. Some \nmanufacturers of food supplements also use this form \nof distribution. In contrast to traditional direct sales, it \nis made attractive to customers by allowing them to act \nas independent sales partners and generate their own \ncustomer base. The company's aim is to sell products \nthrough a continually expanding network of co-workers.  \nGenerally these people are not experts and receive sales \ntraining from the manufacturers. These \"advisers\" then \nreceive a share of the profits via a pyramid-like earn -\nings system. The more customers and salespeople are \nenlisted, the greater the earnings should be.  And so, each \npotential new customer is also a potential new co-worker.  \nSpecial events and lucrative prizes for corresponding \nperformance increase the pressure to succeed \u2013 thus \nadvisers are mainly motivated by profit. Most already \nhave to have bought a minimum amount of products \nat their own cost. Profit sharing and bonus calculations \nonly take place after these products have been success -\nfully sold on. The consumer associations consider direct \nsales to groups of friends, acquaintances, relatives or \ncolleagues to be particularly problematic, as it makes \nrational purchasing decisions difficult.\nFood supplements are not intended to cure or allevi -\nate illnesses. Claims of this kind are not permitted to \nbe used for promotional purposes on product packag -\ning or online descriptions, and breaches can be penal -\nised accordingly. In contrast, it is practically impossible \nfor the responsible supervisory authorities to control oral \nclaims that are circulated via sales events or through \nword-of-mouth propaganda. Only the participants at the \nsales event can confirm whether the company's mainly \nindependent sales partners (\"advisers\") comply with the \nlegal requirements or get carried away and use unlaw -\nful claims about cures for promotional purposes. As a \nresult, the manufacturers avoid responsibility, by alleg -\ning that they do not know what their agents are saying. \nThey would, however, be in a position to examine their \npartners' online promotional activity. In February 2008, \nthe Cologne Higher Regional Court (File No: 6 U 149/07) \ndecided that MLM companies are liable for false and \nexaggerated promotion on their sales partners' websites.Three direct providers were included as examples in \nthe product research:\n -Amway GmbH: Amway Glucosamin NUTRILITE \n(825 mg glucosamine hydrochloride per day)\n -Lifeplus International: Lifeplus Joint Formula \n(1,200 mg glucosamine sulphate per day)\n -PM-International AG: FitLine Gelenk-Fit (500 mg \nglucosamine sulphate per day)\nThe allergen labelling for shellfish and crustaceans was \npresent in all three product descriptions. There was only \ninsufficient important advice for the purchaser: Amway \nand PM-International provided no information for preg -\nnant women and nursing mothers, for diabetics and for \npatients who are taking anticoagulants.\nLifeplus Joint Formula was missing the warning informa -\ntion that the stated dose should not be exceeded, that \nthe product is not a substitute for a healthy diet and that \nit should be kept out of the reach of children.\nFood supplements sold via MLM cost twice as much \nas many other products sold, for example, in chem -\nist's shops, supermarkets or pharmacies. The aver -\nage cost of the former products was EUR 0.80 per daily \ndose. However, the higher price gives no indication as to \nwhether the product is of a superior quality or whether \nits ingredients have better biovavailability.\nIn its terms of business, Lifeplus International refers to a \nUS jurisdiction, in that legal disputes are to be conducted \nin the USA (Arkansas).\nBefore ordering from direct providers, the customer must \nfirst register and then usually has to set up a customer \naccount. Amway und Lifeplus International then estab -\nlish the connection to the sales partner, PM-International \ncalls up the person giving the recommendation.|  THE BUSINESS WITH JOINTS18\n5. CONCLUSION AND DEMANDS\nOsteoarthritis is the most frequent joint ailment world-  \nwide. Deterioration of the joint cartilage mainly affects \nolder people and people who place undue or improper \nstress on their joints. The level of suffering is great, \nwhether it is due to overexertion from work or sport, \nor from overweight. Many patients find the limited \noptions offered by pharmacotherapy to be unsatisfac -\ntory and want to \"do something\" more to help them -\nselves. Affected consumers have a strong need for \ninformation, which some manufacturers exploit to \nspread their promotional messages. The fact that \nenquiries relating to illness dominate the website  \nwww.klartext-nahrungserg\u00e4nzung.de also seems to \nconfirm this.\nEffectiveness not proven\nGlucosamine and chondroitin are offered both as medic -\ninal products and as food supplements. It is questiona -\nble whether taking these substances can protect against \nosteoarthritis or the loss of cartilage. Their incorpora -\ntion into cartilage and the hoped-for prevention and/or \nhealing of cartilage damage resulting from this are also \nunclear. Results of studies on the efficacy of glucosamine \nand chondroitin in combating joint wear and tear \ncontinue to show that they generally are no more effec -\ntive than placebos.\nThe same applies to the joint remedy product \ngroup: Testing/approval by the authorities of all \nfood supplements advertised in Germany (pursuant to \nsection 5 of the Food Supplement Regulation \u2013 NemV) in \nrespect of safety and accuracy of the promotional state -\nments is required urgently before they are first brought \nonto the market instead of the notification procedures \nused to date.Possible side effects\nAppropriate information for special groups of people \nis not always available. Food supplements contain -\ning glucosamine or chondroitin can be problematic for \npeople with diabetes mellitus or limited glucose toler -\nance, as well as for patients who are taking anticoagu -\nlants (coumarin or warfarin). Due to a lack of data on the \nhealth risks, pregnant women and nursing mothers, and \nchildren and young people should also avoid products \ncontaining glucosamine and/or chondroitin.\nEstablishing a central reporting system for the \ncollection of unexpected (side) effects of food \nsupplements which can be accessed by consumers \nwould be desirable. Information on the risks and unde -\nsired effects ought to be stipulated by law.\nUnlawful health claims\nHealth claims must be expressly approved by the Euro -\npean Commission. To date, there is no such approval for \nthe purpose of \"joints\". However, this does not prevent \nthe providers of food supplements from putting on their \npackaging claims that vitamins and minerals support \njoint function. In the view of the consumer associations, \nthis approach must be questioned. As well as economic \nloss suffered by consumers as a result of having been \ndeceived about the effect/effectiveness, unlawful claims \nalso harbour real risks, e.g. if medical care is dispensed \nwith due to medicinal claims.\nIn this case, the supervisory authorities are \nrequired to take stronger measures and penalise \nthe health claims that are not permitted under the \nHealth Claims Regulation.THE BUSINESS WITH JOINTS | 19\nProducts obtained online\nProducts obtained online, in particular, frequently prom -\nise more than can be scientifically proven and is permit -\nted. In the case of the daily dose for glucosamine and \nchondroitin, these products are frequently only margin -\nally below or within the potentially pharmacological \nrange. While the provider is marketing such products \nas food supplements, they are circumventing the test -\ning and verification requirements that are stipulated for \nmedicinal products.\nIt demonstrates that a harmonisation of the legal frame -\nwork at a European level is just as necessary as a coordi -\nnated way of working between the authorities in the EU \nmember states.\nThe legislator should stipulate a positive list for \nadditives with associated maximum doses in \nfood supplements and the competent supervisory \nauthorities should be required to apply sanctions.\nConsumer clarification\nIt should be explained to those consumers who place \ntheir hopes in food supplements for joints that food \nsupplements are not medicinal products and therefore \nthe authorities have not tested them either for safety or \nefficacy, nor approved them. Furthermore, a declaration \nshould be made about the risks and effective alterna -\ntives, such as avoiding becoming overweight and engag -\ning in regular physical activity. Only then will consumers \nbe in a position to make a conscious decision and accept \nany possible risks.\nIn the case of painful joints, useful treatment \nmethods should be discussed with the treating \ndoctor.|  THE BUSINESS WITH JOINTS20\n6.
