Many important questions were asked: Would Santa be a high-risk patient, being a bit overweight (and 1,750 years old)? Would he need a negative [COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7) test from each household before entering? Does he need special protection equipment? Does he need to self-quarantine after each trip? The author recommends that Santa proceed with his visits, seeing how someone without a history of having had [influenza](/de/wissen/Influenza#Za72c6651780a156d4f79b3975508d09a) is unlikely to be affected by [COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7), but it was Dr. Anthony Fauci who confirmed what we hoped for all along: Santa has innate immunity! It seems Christmas won\u2019t be canceled, and, oh boy, are we merry! [1][2]\nA Holiday souvenir \u2013 If you have ever put on a few pounds during the holiday season, you are in good company! A study conducted in the US, Germany, and Japan recorded the weight of 2,924 participants for one year using wireless scales. In the three countries, participants experienced the largest weight increase in the ten days following Christmas. The upside: half the weight gain was swiftly lost afterward. The downside: the other half remained until the summer or beyond. On a lighter note, another study showed that weight monitoring and education on the physical activity calorie equivalent (PACE) of traditional holiday fare could prevent weight gain during the end-of-year festivities. So it might be worthwhile to hang up some motivational posters beside the stockings! [3][4]\nGaming the system \u2013 If weight monitoring is not your thing, you could also consider asking Santa for a gaming console this year! Researchers evaluated the health of 2,459 e-sport players and found that, contrary to popular assumptions, gamers were more likely to have normal weight compared to the general population. They were also more commonly nondrinkers and nonsmokers (their hands are too busy!). This notwithstanding, e-sports rarely provide much in the way of physical activity, and 80.3% of the participants were not meeting the\n[WHO] physical activity guidelines \u2013 which is about the same amount as the general population. So enjoy a much deserved game break this holiday season, but then perhaps get moving to your favorite holiday tunes!

[8]\nThis retrospective cohort study included data from 2,466 hospitalized\n[SARS-CoV-2](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Za0abd91853146a79d53946ed3db633d3) [PCR](/de/wissen/Biochemische_Labormethoden#Z88118df3c49e8662ff7a8ff979911bca)-positive adult patients. Patients were classified using [BMI](/de/wissen/Metabolisches_Syndrom#Z012e2e49483585b4280dc450c5c88d04) and divided into three classes: class 1 (30 to < 35), class 2 (35 to < 40), and class 3 (\u2265 40). The [median](/de/wissen/Angewandte_Statistik#Z7c0546fc00695bf5211ab50534e91c9b) hospital stay was 7 days, 533 patients (22%) were intubated and 627 (25%) died.\nThere was an increased risk for death or\n[intubation](/de/wissen/Allgemeinan\u00e4sthesie#Zea846d3465d1a392fbf008b5131bf900) in all three obesity classes, and the association persisted after controlling for the effects of age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, and chronic comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, pulmonary diseases). The risk was lower in individuals with class 1 obesity (adjusted HR 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9\u20131.4) compared to class 2 (1.3; 0.98\u20131.7) and class 3 obesity (1.6; 1.1\u20132.1). However, this effect was seen only in patients under 65 years of age but not in those aged 65 years or more (P for interaction = 0.042).\nLimitations include that\n[BMI](/de/wissen/Metabolisches_Syndrom#Z012e2e49483585b4280dc450c5c88d04) was missing for 28% of the cohort (multiple imputation for missing [BMI](/de/wissen/Metabolisches_Syndrom#Z012e2e49483585b4280dc450c5c88d04) data was used), increasing the risk of [bias](/de/wissen/Studientypen_der_medizinischen_Forschung#Za32c4b865a6b42d97c485db50e405ab0).\nThe take\u2011home message?\nObesity is an independent risk factor for\n[intubation](/de/wissen/Allgemeinan\u00e4sthesie#Zea846d3465d1a392fbf008b5131bf900) or death in patients with [COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7) regardless of race, ethnicity, and comorbidities, but only in patients younger than 65 years of age. Physicians and policymakers should keep this in mind when considering prevention strategies (e.g., vaccination allocation) and management of [COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7) patients (e.g., hospitalization).

However, a notable limitation of this trial was that patients with prosthetic heart valves were not included. [10]\nThe present study set out to fill this knowledge gap by evaluating the outcomes of 1005 patients with a bioprosthetic valve and atrial\n[fibrillation] or [flutter] and indications for anticoagulation. Patients were randomized at least 48 hours after undergoing mitral-valve surgery to either 15\u201320 mg of [rivaroxaban](/de/wissen/Vitamin-K-Antagonisten_und_direkte_orale_Antikoagulanzien#Z22bbeb78e62fcd17cbdcc573e8ff87cd) (n = 500) or [warfarin](/de/wissen/Vitamin-K-Antagonisten_und_direkte_orale_Antikoagulanzien#Z7d350957bfc20f511eb53f8d589b8adc) treatment (n = 505) with the aim of achieving an [INR](/de/wissen/Blutgerinnung_und_h\u00e4morrhagische_Diathesen#Z46b0c948d5f6dc94d213b58c18037670) of 2\u20133. The maximum follow-up was 12 months.\nThe primary outcomes of mean time until death, major cardiovascular events, or major bleeding did not differ significantly between the groups (P < 0.001 for noninferiority).

The secondary outcomes should also be interpreted with caution due to the low rate of events in each group. These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with non-bioprosthetic valves or those with mitral stenosis.\nThe take\u2011home message?\nThis industry-sponsored study demonstrates that\n[rivaroxaban](/de/wissen/Vitamin-K-Antagonisten_und_direkte_orale_Antikoagulanzien#Z22bbeb78e62fcd17cbdcc573e8ff87cd) is noninferior to [warfarin](/de/wissen/Vitamin-K-Antagonisten_und_direkte_orale_Antikoagulanzien#Z7d350957bfc20f511eb53f8d589b8adc) in the treatment of atrial [fibrillation] in patients with bioprosthetic mitral valves, giving physicians the option to begin treatment with [rivaroxaban](/de/wissen/Vitamin-K-Antagonisten_und_direkte_orale_Antikoagulanzien#Z22bbeb78e62fcd17cbdcc573e8ff87cd) at an early stage after surgery without the need for [INR](/de/wissen/Blutgerinnung_und_h\u00e4morrhagische_Diathesen#Z46b0c948d5f6dc94d213b58c18037670) monitoring.

While the\n[ACC](/de/wissen/Medikamente_gegen_Husten_und_bronchiale_Obstruktion#Z3f6dd950678a8bcdd0077eab31629f32) Expert Consensus recommends reserving IV nitrates for patients with refractory congestive symptoms after initial treatment, the ESC guideline favors the early use of IV nitrates in patients with pulmonary congestion or edema. [12][13]\nThis cross-over trial conducted in France designed a\n[nitrate](/de/wissen/Nitrate_und_Molsidomin#Zc7d2c406d565ba6a80254c5045509ae7) care bundle in order to improve ESC guideline adherence and to assess the benefit of early [nitrate](/de/wissen/Nitrate_und_Molsidomin#Zc7d2c406d565ba6a80254c5045509ae7) use. The study included 503 patients aged 75 years and older who presented to the emergency department (ED) with AHF (worsening dyspnea and other signs of congestion) and randomly assigned them to one of two groups:\n- An intervention group in which patients received early IV\n[nitrate](/de/wissen/Nitrate_und_Molsidomin#Zc7d2c406d565ba6a80254c5045509ae7)boluses, moderate doses of IV [furosemide](/de/wissen/Schleifendiuretika#Za83341d27dcd429ba35ac446fd574de8), and management of precipitating factors (e.g., atrial [fibrillation], infection) in the ED (n = 200)\n- A control group in which patient received \u201cusual care\u201d at the discretion of the emergency physician (n = 303)\nPatients in the intervention group compared to the control group received a higher dose of IV nitrates within 4 hours of treatment (\n[median](/de/wissen/Angewandte_Statistik#Z7c0546fc00695bf5211ab50534e91c9b) difference 23.8 mg; 95% CI, 13 to 34.1 mg), a lower dose of diuretics ( [median](/de/wissen/Angewandte_Statistik#Z7c0546fc00695bf5211ab50534e91c9b) difference -13.1 mg; -25 to -0,9 mg), and proportionately more frequent treatment of precipitating factors in the ED (adjusted difference 31.1%; 14.3\u201347.9%). While the care bundle did improve guideline adherence, there was no significant difference between the two groups in survival rates, all-cause mortality, readmission, length of hospital stay, or [acute kidney injury](/de/wissen/Akute_Nierensch\u00e4digung#Zdff233a18555ad0f8f0c208c072da6e4) at 30 days.\nLimitations include the open-label design, that\n[nitrate](/de/wissen/Nitrate_und_Molsidomin#Zc7d2c406d565ba6a80254c5045509ae7) dosages were variable, and that the control group treatment was not standardized.

Past studies have supported surgery, while others have advocated antibiotic therapy. [15][16]\nTo test this hypothesis further, a US-based, randomized trial included 1,552 adults with appendicitis:\n- 776 underwent appendectomy (96% laparoscopic).\n- 776 were given 10 days of antibiotics, including IV for at least 24 hours or IV as a single dose with a 24-hour bioavailability. The decision whether or not to subsequently perform an appendectomy was ultimately made by the treating clinician.\nOn day 30, a health-related quality of life score (EQ-5D score) [17] of the antibiotics group was not inferior to that of the surgery group. However, 29% of the patients in the antibiotics group would undergo an appendectomy by day 90 (41% of patients with an\n[appendicolith] and 25% without). There were no deaths, and the rate of serious [adverse events](/de/wissen/Qualit\u00e4tsmanagement#Z4819640973dcff73dbf583f1b61eae1c) did not differ significantly between the two groups, but patients in the antibiotics group had significantly more complications (8.1 vs. 3.5%). When excluding patients with [appendicoliths], the rate of complications was similar between the groups (3.7 vs. 3.5%); emergency department visits and hospitalizations after treatment allocation were more frequent in the antibiotics group.\nLimitations of this study include that outcomes > 90 days are not available, this study was not blinded, and antibiotic regimes were not standardized.\nThe take\u2011home message?\nResults from this study suggest that antibiotic therapy is non inferior to surgical intervention for the treatment of acute appendicitis.

Data from 19,629 patients over the age of 2 years was used to develop the new European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC) equation and validate it internally and externally. The gold standard was a measured [GFR](/de/wissen/Chronische_Nierenerkrankung#Z9b64c222c41232ab914b726d36f985de) (mGFR) that was established by either [plasma] [clearance](/de/wissen/Pharmakologische_Grundlagen#Z25e117eae56015c6c78e01717e9a4dba) or urinary [clearance](/de/wissen/Pharmakologische_Grundlagen#Z25e117eae56015c6c78e01717e9a4dba) of exogenous filtration markers in all patients.\nIn comparison to the\n[CKD-EPI](/de/wissen/Laboratoriumsmedizin#Zb3210e49c8a7130fc92460a5766465f9), CKiD, and [FAS](/de/wissen/Fetale_Alkoholspektrumst\u00f6rung#Z540f58959f444d2828706302f87d2e63) equations, the [eGFR] calculated with the EKFC [formula](/de/wissen/Ern\u00e4hrung_im_Kindes-_und_Jugendalter#Z1b9f87245d12a4f1d6962aeb616ba92a) was closest to the mGFR in all age groups (except 2\u20134 years) and in all subgroups of kidney function (lower [bias](/de/wissen/Studientypen_der_medizinischen_Forschung#Za32c4b865a6b42d97c485db50e405ab0)).

[27][28]\nThree board-certified radiologists labeled 1,998 AP frontal chest radiographs according to 72 prespecified findings: anatomical (e.g., consolidations,\n[pneumothorax](/de/wissen/Pneumothorax#Z3ac67f125de9e5f9fc8086b170080388), masses), devices (e.g., cardiac pacer and wires), technical (e.g., rotated x-ray), and tubes and lines (e.g., correctly or incorrectly positioned central intravascular lines). These interpretations served as the gold standard for this study.\nFive third-year radiology residents from different US academic medical centers were then tested against a previously trained and validated AI deep learning model in interpreting a set of approximately 400 images per resident versus all 1,998 of these images, respectively. The mean image-based sensitivity to detect the labeled findings was similar for the residents and the AI model (72 vs. 71.6%, P = 0.66). The mean specificity was higher for the AI model compared to the residents (98 vs. 97.3%, P < 0.001), as was the positive predictive value (73 vs. 68.2%, P = 0.001). Overall, the AI algorithm performed better than the residents in more prevalent, less complex findings (e.g., cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, hyperaeration) but worse in less prevalent, more complex ones (e.g., masses, nodules, enlarged hilum).\nAn important limitation was that the AI model was tested against only five radiology residents.\nThe take\u2011home message?\nAn AI algorithm may perform similarly to radiology residents in evaluating AP chest radiographs when compared to board-certified radiologists.

A recent survey study suggests that the willingness of US adults to receive a\n[COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7) vaccine is affected by various factors, including not only questions of [efficacy](/de/wissen/Patientenversorgung_und_Gesundheitssystem#Z9c24089e9b15284c931c20e196ceb36f) and risk but also by political partisanship and where the vaccine was produced. But what about the rest of the world? [30][31][32]\nA survey conducted in 19 countries asked 13,426 participants selected at random, first, whether they would take a generally available vaccine if proven safe and effective and, second, whether they would take a vaccine if recommended by their employer. Results showed an overall willingness to receive a\n[COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7) vaccine as follows:\n- 71.5% \u201ccompletely agree\u201d or \u201csomewhat agree;\u201d 14.2% \u201cneutral/no opinion;\u201d 14.2% \u201csomewhat disagree\u201d or \u201ccompletely agree\u201d\n- Lowest acceptance rate was 54.9% (Russia); highest acceptance rate was 88.6% (China); US acceptance rate was 75.4%\nPositive responses increased with age (highest in participants \u2265 65 years), residency in a country with a high incidence and with higher mortality rates due to\n[COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7), and in individuals who trusted their government. Positive responses decreased with low income (lowest in participants earning < 2 USD/day) and low level of education. Willingness to take an employer-recommended vaccine was lower overall (61.4%), with younger participants (18\u201324 years) being more willing to follow such a recommendation than older ones.\nThe take\u2011home message?\n[COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7) vaccine acceptance is likely highly variable, depending on country, demographics, and trust in government.

After simulation training, their performance was tested using the Paracentesis Competency Assessment Tool (PCAT) with two cutoff points: a Minimum Passing Standard (MPS) and an Unsupervised Practice Standard (UPS). All residents achieved an MPS, and approximately 40% achieved a UPS. Residents were then randomly allocated to reassess their competencies either at 3 and 6 months (group A, n = 60) or only once at 6 months (group B, n = 58). At 3 months, the performance of group A declined by both MPS (100 vs. 52.5%, P < 0.001) and UPS (40 vs. 13.6%, P = 0.002) metrics.

The [FDA] has recently revoked emergency use authorization for both chloroquine and HCQ because the potential side effects outweigh the benefits [92]. Notwithstanding the controversy over the use of HCQ to treat [COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7), researchers in the US and Canada set out to determine if the drug could be useful in preventing the disease.\nA randomized, double-blind,\n[placebo]-controlled trial tested the effectiveness of HCQ as postexposure prophylaxis (within 4 days of exposure) in 821 asymptomatic adults exposed to [COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7). Exposure was defined as a moderate-risk (face mask but no eye shield) or high-risk (neither face mask nor eye shield) contact to an individual with confirmed [COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7) for \u2265 10 minutes at a distance of < 6 ft.

Patients were allocated 1:1 to receive either HCQ or a [placebo]. After the 14-day follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference in incidence between the intervention and the control groups (11.8% vs.14.3%, P = 0.35). However, side effects were more common in the HCQ group (40.1% vs. 16.8%, P < 0.001), as was lower treatment [compliance] (75.4% vs. 82.6%, P = 0.01).\nThe take home message?\nHCQ use in this trial was not effective in preventing\n[COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7) in exposed patients and frequently caused side effects, adding to the growing evidence against the use of HCQ for [COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7).

Newly registered handgun owners (n=676,425) were compared with nonowners (n=25,637,011). Gun owners were more likely to be white, male, and residents of rural areas. During the study period, 17,894 people died by suicide, 6,691 of whom died by suicide involving a firearm. Suicide rate by any method was three times higher for male handgun owners and seven times higher for female handgun owners compared with nonowners. The adjusted hazard ratio of suicide by firearm was almost eight times higher for male handgun owners and 35 times higher for female handgun owners compared to individuals who did not own a handgun.

Previous research in children [98] and adults [99] has shown that a 4-month rifampin regimen is equally effective in treating latent TB and has higher completion rates than the usual 9-month\n[isoniazid](/de/wissen/Tuberkulose#Z0a185ef468711f3a4465556d1e8632ec) regimen, but it has not become established due to the high cost per rifampin pill.\nA recently published study set out to compare the health system costs of 9-month\n[isoniazid](/de/wissen/Tuberkulose#Z0a185ef468711f3a4465556d1e8632ec) vs. 4-month rifampin in 6,012 adults and 829 children with latent TB infection in high-, middle-, and lower-income countries. Health care use was tabulated for each participant using various sources including local unit costs (imaging and lab studies), information from the [WHO] CHOICE tool [100] (health care visits and hospitalization costs), and the Global Drug Facility list and local ministries of health [101] (cost of the medication).\nThe average costs were significantly lower in the rifampin group in all income settings compared to the\n[isoniazid](/de/wissen/Tuberkulose#Z0a185ef468711f3a4465556d1e8632ec) group. Routine follow-up visits accounted for a significant portion of the costs in the high- and middle-income countries. Sensitivity analysis showed that rifampin remained more cost-effective, even when compared to a shorter 6-month course of [isoniazid](/de/wissen/Tuberkulose#Z0a185ef468711f3a4465556d1e8632ec).\nThe take home message?\nAlthough the cost per pill of rifampin is higher than that of\n[isoniazid](/de/wissen/Tuberkulose#Z0a185ef468711f3a4465556d1e8632ec), the total cost of a 4-month rifampin regimen was significantly lower than that of the standard 9-month [isoniazid](/de/wissen/Tuberkulose#Z0a185ef468711f3a4465556d1e8632ec) regimen in this study.

A multicenter, nonblinded, randomized trial has now investigated whether one of the simplest tests in the arsenal, the passive leg raise (PLR), might be able to better guide fluid management.\nPatients were randomized 2:1 into an intervention group (n=83) and a usual care group (n=41). If the PLR test was positive (significant increase in stroke volume), patients in the intervention group received a crystalloid fluid bolus.

Who can forget the infamous rants of Dr. Cox and Dr. House? As entertaining as the shows may be, actually being on the receiving end of such behavior is no enjoyable experience. A new study has shed some light on the scale and the consequences of the problem in surgical residencies.\nGeneral surgery residents in the US were asked to respond to a voluntary, confidential survey. The validated S-NAQ was used to measure how often they experienced nine specific bullying behaviors (e.g., being the subject of gossip, being shouted at) within the past academic year.\nOf the 6,264 S-NAQ respondents, 66.9% had experienced bullying at least once, while occasional and frequent bullying was reported by 43.8% and 18.1% of respondents respectively. Attending surgeons were the group most frequently reported to engage in bullying. The groups who most frequently reported exposure to bullying were women, divorcees, widow(er)s, members of ethnic minorities, and residents with low ABSITE scores. The study furthermore showed that frequent exposure to bullying was associated with potentially severe consequences, including attrition,\n[burnout](/de/wissen/Unipolare_Depression#Zb41ceebc50587ff5a2f360f3ca255f70), and suicidal ideation.\nThe take home message?\nBullying is still common in surgical training programs and a cause for concern given the mental health issues it entails.

The most commonly reported\n[triage] criteria were presumed benefit (96.2%) and need (53.8%). Most policies used scoring systems (80.8%), the most frequently used being the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Half of all responders used an age criterion, yet only 7.7% specified age thresholds. 38.4% of policies gave preference to health care workers.

But what do we know about the benefits of its long-term use before major surgery?\nA recent retrospective cohort study set out to determine the benefits of long-term\n[metformin](/de/wissen/Antidiabetika#Z844473d0d0277bb5630f7ad66be085c0) use on postoperative outcomes. The researchers evaluated electronic health records of 10,088 patients with T2DM who had undergone a major surgical intervention (defined as any procedure that required general anesthesia and a postoperative hospital stay) between January 2010 and January 2016 and studied the effects of [metformin](/de/wissen/Antidiabetika#Z844473d0d0277bb5630f7ad66be085c0) use (defined as one or more prescriptions) in the 180 days prior to the procedure. 5,962 patients (59%) with preoperative [metformin](/de/wissen/Antidiabetika#Z844473d0d0277bb5630f7ad66be085c0) prescriptions were propensity score-matched with 5,460 patients (54%) who had not taken [metformin](/de/wissen/Antidiabetika#Z844473d0d0277bb5630f7ad66be085c0).\nThe\n[metformin](/de/wissen/Antidiabetika#Z844473d0d0277bb5630f7ad66be085c0) group had a lower hazard ratio for mortality at 90 days (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55\u20130.95; P = 0.02) and at 5 years (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65\u20130.85; P < 0.001). In addition, they had lower rates of readmission at 30 days (sub-HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72\u20130.98, P = 0.02) and 90 days (sub-HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77\u20130.97, P = 0.01).\nThese results should be viewed critically, since the exact dosages and durations of the\n[metformin](/de/wissen/Antidiabetika#Z844473d0d0277bb5630f7ad66be085c0) regimens were unknown and there is potential for residual [confounding](/de/wissen/Studientypen_der_medizinischen_Forschung#Zb4262971e106e4799561831435f78cd1). Furthermore, the reasons why patients with T2DM were not on [metformin](/de/wissen/Antidiabetika#Z844473d0d0277bb5630f7ad66be085c0) could vary greatly (e.g., contraindications due to preexisting conditions, adverse effects, [aversion](/de/wissen/Emotion_und_Motivation#Z821578a48162757f72797598cfcea3b0) to treatment).\nThe take-home message?\nPleiotropic effects of\n[metformin](/de/wissen/Antidiabetika#Z844473d0d0277bb5630f7ad66be085c0) may benefit T2DM patients after major surgery, but further studies are needed to prove a causal connection between [metformin](/de/wissen/Antidiabetika#Z844473d0d0277bb5630f7ad66be085c0) and better outcomes.\n- Title of study: Association Between Preoperative\n[Metformin](/de/wissen/Antidiabetika#Z844473d0d0277bb5630f7ad66be085c0)Exposure and Postoperative Outcomes in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes [106]\n- Authors: Reitz et al.\n- Journal: JAMA Surgery\n- AMBOSS links:\n[Perioperative management](/de/wissen/Perioperatives_Management#Z3a7bd0c1bd5a355d4ac6d1ae3fc9717c)l [Antidiabetic drugs](/de/wissen/Antidiabetika#Z5ed3a96a8ba63c98ac87d0912b48977e)\nPredicting critical illness in\n[COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7)\nOne-Minute Telegram 2-2020-3/3 - Many hospitals are struggling with insufficient space and resources to treat patients with\n[COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7). Early identification of patients that will progress to critical illness would enable a more adequate and efficient distribution of medical resources. Chinese researchers aimed to develop and validate a clinical risk score (COVID-GRAM ) to help predict critical illness (defined as admission to the ICU, invasive [ventilation](/de/wissen/Atemwege_und_Lunge#Zbffa82a865686699ed8a6fc3276b5293), or death) in hospitalized patients with [COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7).\nThe medical records of 1,590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients with\n[COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7) were screened retrospectively for 72 variables, of which 10 (chest radiography abnormality, age, hemoptysis, dyspnea, unconsciousness, number of comorbidities, cancer history, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct [bilirubin](/de/wissen/H\u00e4moglobin#Z5ca8744f29cf36f71767b18a1b1e5fa5)) were included in the final model as statistically significant predictors of critical illness. The score was then validated for its generalizability with 710 patients from other Chinese hospitals that were not included in the initial cohort. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC), which was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84\u20130.93), showed good performance in discriminating between patients who developed critical illness from those who did not.\nThe take-home message?\nThe COVID-GRAM score is one of the first instruments available for predicting critical illness in\n[COVID-19](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z133b5d6becb618171a9722fa816a56d7).

However, nearly one quarter of patients had serious adverse effects. The most serious adverse effects (multiple organ dysfunction, septic shock, acute kidney failure) were more commonly reported in patients already being mechanically ventilated.\nThe take-home message? Although the study showed clinical improvement with\n[remdesivir](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Z3d23c4f6196dd4e7ece49c1bd7290569) in the majority of participants, its small sample size, intransparent selection criteria, and lack of a control group make any conclusions regarding the drug's therapeutic effectiveness against [SARS-CoV-2](/de/wissen/COVID-19#Za0abd91853146a79d53946ed3db633d3) tentative at best.

Neurological symptoms were identified in about one third of the patients. Nonspecific symptoms such as [dizziness](/de/wissen/Schwindel#Ze8b4c0f0c55909252ceee5f1b6b3fbc5) (16.8%), headache (13.1%), and muscle injury (10.7%) were most frequently reported, but impaired consciousness (7.5%) and acute cerebrovascular disease (2.8%) were also seen, especially in those with severe disease. In some patients, neurological symptoms occurred early in the course of disease and in others they even manifested before respiratory symptoms developed.\nThis study had significant limitations, as it was a small, retrospective, observational study that relied on medical record screening. Furthermore, the study failed to corroborate the results of previous studies (Yan et al. [111], Vetter et al.

Not surprisingly, the patients who died were older and more frequently had a history of chronic respiratory and cardiac disease than those who survived. About half of the patients who died had been seen previously in an outpatient setting, suggesting that outcomes could have been improved by earlier diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, about two-thirds of the patients who died had a preexisting mental disorder.\nThe take-home message?
