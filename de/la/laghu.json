PROBLEM\nDue to their growth, children have a higher nutrient \nrequirement per kilogram of body weight than adults. If \nthere is a lack of nutrients, it cannot be ruled out that \nthis may lead to developmental disorders in the child. A \nwholesome diet with plenty of cereal products, potatoes, \nvegetables, fruit and dairy products should therefore be \nensured, especially during the growth and development \nperiods of the child. Meat, (sea) fish and eggs in moder -\nation complete the weekly menu.\nIn practice, however, children also have a mind of their \nown when eating and drinking. They sometimes refuse \nto eat food such as vegetables and have greater recourse \nto sweets and their favourite foods. Parents then quickly \nfear an undersupply of vital nutrients and negative \neffects on the physical and mental development of their \nchild.\nTwo large German studies - the DONALD study  (Dortmund \nNutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed \nStudy) and the EsKiMo study  (nutritional study as KiGGS \nmodule) - have shown that, with a few exceptions, nutri-\nent supply in children is generally good. Only the vitamin \nfolate as well as the minerals iron, iodine and calcium reference values are not reached by all children. The \nsame applies to the estimated1 value for an adequate \nintake of vitamin D [1-3]. However, this does not mean \nthat these children actually have a corresponding defi-\nciency. Regular outdoor activities from spring to autumn \ncan significantly improve the supply of vitamin D under \nthe influence of the sunlight. The intake of vitamins B 1, \nB2, B6, B12, niacin and C, on the other hand, is on aver -\nage above the reference values of the German Nutrition \ncompany (DGE), even without food supplements [2].\nNevertheless, the two studies found that about ten \npercent of all children (two to 18 years old) in Germany \nreceive daily food supplements from their parents and/\nor foods enriched with vitamins or minerals [1-3]. Espe-\ncially among boys, the frequency of use increases with \nage [2, 4]. Even though the figures are only compara-\nble to a limited extent due to different study designs, \ncurrent data from other countries show that significantly \nmore children worldwide are given food supplements \n(Tab.1) The Robert Koch Institute is currently working \non a supplementary module of the EsKiMo study. More \nrecent data on the consumption of food supplements by \nchildren in Germany is therefore expected in the course \nof 2018 [5].\n1 The estimated value applies to children, adolescents and adults \nwith a complete lack of endogenous formation. Therefore, this only \napplies to a very small part of the population, e.g. bedridden or \nfully veiled persons.Country Share of consumption of  \nfood supplementsAge of children\nAustralia [6] 23.5 percent \u2264 9 years\nChina [7] 33.5 percent  2 to  5 years\nDenmark [8] 37.5 percent  7 to  8 years\nEngland [9] 25.5 percent  4 to 10 years\nJapan [10]  8.0 percent  3 to  4 years\nCanada [11] 28.4 percent 10 to 11 years\nKorea [12] 54.2 percent  1 to  6 years\nNorthern Ireland [13] 26.0 percent  4 to 10 years\nPoland [14] 34.0 percent  4 to  6 years\nUSA [15] 45.0 percent  2 to  5 years\n36.0 percent  6 to 11 years\nTable 1: Current data on the proportion of children consuming food supplements in different countriesMarket check food supplements for children |5\nRegular consumption of food supplements in children \nmay result in a far higher intake than recommended, \nwith the risk of adverse effects. This applies in particular \nwhen additionally enriched foodstuffs, such as breakfast \ncereals or multivitamin juices, are on the menu [16-18].\nFood supplements for children and adolescents with \na whole range of vitamins, minerals or omega-3 fatty \nacids are available on the market. To appeal especially \nto parents and children, they are often offered in forms \nsuch as bears or cars, as juices or fruit gums [3, 18]. The \nproducts convey the impression, for example with the \nname or the presentation, that the defensive forces are \nstrengthened. They are also intended to make us believe \nthat children can better meet the challenges of modern \nchildren's everyday lives with an extra portion of vita-\nmins, minerals or special fatty acids \u2013 in particular if \nthey are supposed to be more efficient than others or \nif they have learning difficulties or concentration prob-\nlems.\nAccording to the Health Claims Directive (HCVO), adver -\ntising claims that promise health benefits must be \nscientifically proven. Only statements authorised by the \nEU may be used by providers. In addition to generally \napproved health claims, there are also specific health \nclaims relating to the development and health of chil-\ndren (\"children claims\") for very few ingredients [19, 20].\nWith the current enrichment of foodstuffs and the use \nof nutrients in food supplements, a nutritional-physio-\nlogical concept is rarely discernible [18]. Rather, there is \nthe impression of a watering can principle. If its multi-\nple effects on children's nutrient intake are difficult for \nprofessionals to assess [17 , 22], then it is likely to be \neven more difficult for most parents.\nWhat has been proven to be good for the development \nof children is a varied diet, sufficient drinking, sufficient \nsleep and regular exercise in the fresh air.2.  TARGET SETTING OF \nTHE MARKET CHECK\nThe market check of the consumer centres focused on \nthe market segment of food supplements, which are \noffered to the target group of children by the layout or \ncorresponding age information. The experts evaluated \nthe offer in the stationary trading. The aim was to check \nwhether the products could pose a health risk due to \ntheir composition. The market check also focused on \nlabelling, dosage form and advertising messages.\n3. PROCEDURES\nThe market check was conducted between December \n2017 and January 2018. Within the scope of a sample \nthat does not claim to be exhaustive, a total of 26 freely \navailable products from the stationary trading (phar -\nmacy, drugstore and health food store) were included \nand examined more closely with regard to the criteria \nmentioned under the objective.\nThe D-A-CH reference values for daily vitamin and mineral \nintake for children aged four to seven years were used to \nevaluate micronutrient contents. The German nutrition \ncompany (DGE), together with the professional socie-\nties in Austria (Austrian nutrition company) and Switzer -\nland (Swiss nutrition company), has published reference \nvalues for nutrient intake (D-A-CH reference values) for \nall age groups, which refer to the entire diet, i.e. includ-\ning a possible intake of food supplements. They should \nbe the basis and support for a full and varied diet [21].\nThe consumer centres also compared the dosages of \nthe products with the proposals for maximum amounts \nof vitamins and minerals in food supplements made by \nthe Federal institute for risk assessment (BfR). However, \nthe limits updated at the beginning of 2018 only apply to \nadolescents aged 15 and above and adults; according to \nthe BfR, separate considerations and, where appropri-\nate, lower dosages of products are necessary for children \nunder the age of 15. A concrete statement is only made \nfor food supplements containing copper and boron, \nwhich are not suitable for children and adolescents [22]. \nIf the purchased food supplements for children reached \nthese maximum quantity proposals, this was in any case \nto be criticized from the point of view of the consumer \ncentres. The BfR recommendations take into account | Market check food supplements for children6\nthe supply situation in Germany and the risk posed by \nindividual substances if their supply is too high. These \nrecommendations for the maximum daily intake of indi-\nvidual vitamins and minerals in food supplements are \nnot legally binding and are therefore not binding for \nproducers. However, they help the consumers to a safe \npurchase.\nThe consumer centres also examined advertising prac -\ntices for this product group. In particular, the word-\ning and legality of health claims were checked. The \ncomplete and correct labelling of legally required (warn-\ning) notices has also been verified. They evaluated the \nadvertising messages on the packaging of the food \nsupplements offered. Statements on the package leaflet \nor on the inner packaging were not taken into account \nbecause they are not visible to consumers at the time of \nthe purchase decision and are therefore not decisive for \nthe purchase.\n4. RESULTS\n4.1 COMPOSITION AND DOSAGE\nThe evaluation of the 26 products focused on the compo-\nsition and recommended dosage.\n4.1.1 Composition\nEach of the products listed in the market check contained \nvitamins and minerals for which there are D-A-CH refer -\nence values [21]. The composition varied considerably \nfrom product to product - a uniformity could not be deter -\nmined. Vitamins A and C were most abundant, namely in \n22 products (85 percent). Vitamins B 6 and niacin were \npresent in 21 food supplements (81 percent). In terms \nof minerals, zinc was on the first place (ten products), \nfollowed by selenium (seven products) and magnesium \nand calcium (six products each). All the vitamins and \nminerals mentioned and others beyond were contained \nin the product \"Orthomol junior C plus\", for example, as \ncan be seen from the nutrition label (Fig. 1). Other ingre-\ndients played a role in eight products (31 percent), with \nomega-3 fatty acids (a combination of docosahexaenoic \nacid and eicosapentaenoic acid) dominating and occur -\nring five times. The ingredient lists also showed that 21 \nout of 26 products (81 percent) contained sugar and/or \nother sweeteners such as sucralose. Sweetening ingre-\ndients were also used, such as juices, extracts and fruit \npurees. Only two of the 26 products examined were without any sweetness. \nAlso the dosage form and consumption recommen-\ndations differed from producer to producer. The food \nsupplements were most frequently available in tablet \nform or in liquid form, followed by fruit gums. Occasion-\nally, powders, capsules, jellies or toffees played a role. \nChildren-attractive shapes such as little bears or cars as \ntablets, easy ways of absorption such as juices and fruit \njelly figures in combination with sweetness can lead to \ngreater attractiveness for children and parents [18]. This, \nin turn, entails the risk of exceeding the recommended \nintake, which may have consequences for the health. \nWith regard to daily consumption, there was a range of \nrecommendations, varying from exact data such as \"chil-\ndren from 4 to 7 years suck 2 tablets per day\" to non-spe-\ncific recommendations such as \"1-3 tablets per day\", e.g. \nfor the product \"naturafit Kindervitamine mit Calcium\" \n(Fig. 2). In the case of the recommended intake of three \ntablets, the D-A-CH reference values for children aged \nfour to seven years would be exceeded for ten out of \neleven ingredients \u2013 for this product alone [21].Market check food supplements for children |7\nFigure 1: Composition of a food supplement containing 27 different ingredients from a pharmacy intended for children \nfrom the age of four (Orthomol junior C plus). The product contains copper, which, according to the BfR recommenda-\ntions for children and adolescents, should not be contained at all in food supplements. The maximum level proposed \nby the BfR in food supplements (applies to the age group from 15 years onwards) is exceeded for vitamin A, vitamin E, \ncopper, manganese and reached for folic acid and iron [22].\nFigure 2: Composition of a food supplement from the pharmacy with non-specific consumption recommendation of \nthe producer (naturafit Kindervitamine mit Calcium). With a daily dosage of three tablets, the maximum amount of \n200 \u00b5g folic acid per day in food supplements proposed by the BfR (applies to the age group from 15 years onwards) \nis exceeded [22].| Market check food supplements for children8\n4.1.2 Dosage\nIn total, 22 of the 26 products (85 percent) have \nexceeded the D-A-CH reference values for at least one \nvitamin or mineral for children between the ages of \nfour and seven years when used as intended in accord-\nance with the intake recommendations (Annex 1) - up to \nexceeding the values for all vitamins and minerals within \na product (Mulgatol\u00ae Junior jelly). In addition, with this \nfood supplement an exact dosage and adherence to the \nconsumption recommendation is difficult. To measure \nthe gel, it is referred to one teaspoon, however, a dosage \nspoon is missing (Fig. 3). The food supplements offered \nfor children most frequently exceeded the D-A-CH refer -\nence values for children aged four to seven years for vita-\nmin C, vitamin B 6, biotin and vitamin E (Annex 1).\nFigure 3: Composition and recommendation for con-\nsumption of a food supplement from a pharmacy that \nmakes exact dosage difficult (Mulgatol\u00ae Junior jelly). To \nmeasure the gel, it is referred to one teaspoon, however, \na dosage spoon is missing.\nThe D-A-CH estimate for an adequate vitamin D intake \nin the absence of endogenous formation, which is 20 \n\u00b5g per day, was problematic in the assessment [21]. An \ninquiry with the DGE, whether a food supplement with \n10 \u00b5g was already dosage too highly, resulted in: \"For a \nchild who corresponding to the age, likes to be outdoors \na lot, the supplement of 10 \u00b5g vitamin D daily is not indi-\ncated. As soon as the body's own formation is suffi-\ncient, the question arises as to the benefits of such a \nsupplement\". This statement can be seen as a confirma-\ntion that an additional intake of vitamin D, which acts \nas a hormone, makes no sense if the body's endoge-nous formation exists.2 Consequently, enrichment and \nsupplementation with vitamin D should be questioned \nif no information is available on the actual supply situ-\nation. This would have to be determined beforehand by \nthe paediatrician and, if necessary, an appropriate medi-\ncation would have to be prescribed [23]. For four prod-\nucts of our sample the recommended daily dosage of \nthe producers was 10 \u00b5g for vitamin D. Particularly with \nfat-soluble vitamins, which include vitamin D and vita-\nmin A, increased caution is required. These can accumu-\nlate in the body and have a negative effect on health.\nThe proposed maximum levels for vitamins and miner -\nals in food supplements proposed by BfR, which refer \nto the age group from 15 years onwards have also been \nused for the assessment with sobering results [22]: Still, \neleven products and thus 42 percent exceeded these \nrecommendations for at least one vitamin or mineral \n(Figs. 1, 2 and 4), six other products (19 percent) were \nat the limit of the recommended maximum quanti-\nties.From this point of view, vitamin A was particularly \nconspicuous (Annex 1). The risk of adverse effects is \nhigh (e.g. headache, fatigue, exhaustion, nausea, loss \nof appetite, dehydration of the skin, cracked lips, itch-\ning, muscle pain, joint and bone pain, edema, growth \nretardation, etc.) [24-26]. For the product \"sanostol\u00ae \nlozenges\", for example, the vitamin A intake when the \nconsumption instructions were observed was almost 2.5 \ntimes higher than the maximum daily dosage of 200 \u00b5g \nrecommended by the BfR for food supplements (Fig. 4).3\n2To ensure adequate care, the DGE recommends exposing the face, \nhands and arms uncovered and without sun protection to the sun \ntwo to three times a week between March and October (10 to 25 \nminutes). Sunburn should be avoided at all costs. In the winter \nmonths, the formation of vitamin D is only possible to a limited \nextent in our latitudes, but vitamin D formed in summer can be \nstored in the fatty tissue and skeletal muscles and contribute to \nmaintaining the vitamin D serum concentration in winter.\n3 In the case of vitamin A, the BfR even does not recommend the \ngeneral enrichment of other foods with vitamin A in order to coun-\nteract the health consequences of an overdose [22].Market check food supplements for children |9\nFigure 4: Composition of a food supplement from a \npharmacy with a very high recommended daily dosage \nof vitamin A intended for children from the age of four \n(sanostol\u00ae lozenges). The maximum amount of 200 \u00b5g \nvitamin A per day in food supplements proposed by the \nBfR (applies to the age group from 15 years onwards) is \nclearly exceeded. With a daily consumption of three tab-\nlets for children from seven years onwards, as recom-\nmended by the producer, the BfR value is even four times \nexceeded [22].\n4.1.3 Legal aspects\nFrom a legal point of view, food supplements are food-\nstuffs and do not have to undergo an authorisation \nprocedure. They only have to be notified to the Federal \nOffice of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) \nbefore being placed on the market. It is sufficient to indi-\ncate the name of the product and the person responsi-\nble (producer, distributor or importer) and to attach a \nsample of the label. Some producers have not complied \nwith this notification obligation according to para-\ngraph 5 of the Directive on Food Supplements (NemV). \nA request to the BVL revealed that four of the 26 prod-\nucts (15 percent) were not listed in the BVL database \n(Annex 1).These products should not be on the market. \nThese include the \"Amos Vital FIZZY VITS Kinder-Multi-\nvitamin lozenges\" from the pharmacy, which exceed \nthe D-A-CH reference values for almost all vitamins and \nminerals contained (Fig. 5).Figure 5: Composition of a food supplement from the \npharmacy (Amos Vital FIZZY VITS Kinder-Multivitamin \nlozenges), which is NOT deposited in the database of the \nBVL (obligation to notify according to \u00a7 5 of the Directive \non Food Supplements). With a daily dosage of two loz -\nenges, the maximum amount of 200 \u00b5g folic acid per day \nin food supplements proposed by the BfR (applies to the \nage group from 15 years onwards) is reached [22].\n4.2 ADVERTISING STATEMENTS UNDER THE \nMAGNIFYING GLASS\nA further objective of the market check was to check the \nadmissibility of the advertising statements on the prod-\nucts.\n4.2.1 Addressing the target group\nIn almost all products, terms such as \"children\", \"kids\", \n\"junior\" or \"family\" are part of the product name, for \nexample \"children's vitamins with calcium\", \"aronia+ \nKids\", \"Orthomol junior C plus\" or \"Immun Multivita-\nmine family\". The packaging of most products is colour -\nful and the pictures are attractive for children and their \nparents. In addition to images of children's faces, comic-\nlike images of animals or humans are used. One prod-\nuct even advertises with the picture of Yakari, an Indian \nboy known from television (Fig. 6). The following state-\nment can be found on the provider's website with regard \nto the aronia juice contained: \"Just like the little Indian \nboy Yakari, the indigenous peoples of the North Amer -\nican continent already collected the bluish berries and \nprocessed them into nutritious food.\"\n| Market check food supplements for children10\nIn addition, the target group at which the food supple-\nments are directed to, can be identified by the age infor -\nmation, special health-related information for children \nand other advertising slogans. For example, according \nto recommended consumption or age indications else-\nwhere on the packaging, many products are recom-\nmended for children aged four and above. General \nstatements such as \"Vitamins and minerals are indis-\npensable for a smooth functioning organism, especially \nfor children\" or \"Natural vitamins and minerals for chil-\ndren\" or health-related statements such as \"With vita-\nmin D as a contribution to a normal function of the \nimmune system for children\" or \"Calcium and vitamin D \nare needed for normal growth and bone development of \nchildren\" also point to children as a target group.\n4.2.2  Advertising with promises about \nhealth\nTogether with a positive list, the HCVO regulates which \nhealth claims are permitted on foodstuffs and under \nwhich conditions they may be used for product adver -\ntising [19, 20].\nFor a few ingredients, health claims that specifically refer \nto children's development and health (\"child claims\"), \nfor example, \"Calcium and vitamin D are essential for \nhealthy growth and a healthy development of bones in \nchildren\" are also permitted. \nTen out of 26 products do not require any health claims. \nA total of 171 health claims were found on the other \n16 products (an average of 10.7 claims per product). Most \nhealth claims were found on the back of each product.Figure 6: Example from the pharmacy for images that \nappeal to children on the packaging (aronia+ KIDS). The \nmaximum amount of 200 \u00b5g vitamin A per day in food \nsupplements proposed by the BfR (applies to the age \ngroup from 15 years onwards) is reached [22].\nEight packages contain \u2013 as already recognizable from \nthe outside - tablets or fruit gums attractive to children, \nfor example in the form of bears or racing cars. The \ncollection campaign for the product \"Orthomol junior \nOmega plus\" is particularly striking: If sufficient coupons \nare handed in, the producer promises a small surprise - \nnaturally only with simultaneous indication of personal \ndata. From a consumer perspective, it is worthy of criti-\ncism if children are introduced to food supplements at \nan early stage through targeted marketing campaigns \nsuch as membership in a \"junior club\". (Fig. 7).\nFigure 7: Example of a collection campaign for a food supplement (Orthomol junior Omega plus)Market check food supplements for children |11\nA statement on brain function is permissible for DHA. It \nreads \"DHA contributes to the maintenance of normal \nbrain function\". However, this statement may not be \napplied to the EPA. In addition, in the above permissible \nstatement on DHA, there was no mandatory reference to \nthe fact that the positive effect occurs with a daily intake \nof 250 mg DHA.\nThe supplier of this product is known to the consumer \ncentres. The company was warned in 2014 for inadmis-\nsible advertising statements on the food supplement \n\"Omega iQ Junior\" [27].\nFrom the point of view of the consumer centres, a further \n39 health claims should be examined by the food control \nauthority or by the courts.The health claims related mainly to vitamins and miner -\nals - most frequently vitamins D, C, B 2 and B 6 as well as \nzinc. Health claims were also used for the omega-3 fatty \nacids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentae-\nnoic acid (EPA).\nA review of all the claims against the HCVO revealed that \none of the health claims used is not authorised (Fig. 8). \nIt read: \"The special Omega 3 variants DHA and EPA are \nof outstanding importance for the structure and function \nof our brain and nerve cells. They are incorporated into \nthe cell membranes in the form of phospholipids and it \nis precisely in this form that they are particularly valua-\nble as brain nutrients.\"\nFigure 8: Illegal health claim (OMEGA\u00ae iQ balance)| Market check food supplements for children12\nThe decisive factors for this evaluation were, for exam-\nple:\nMissing elements of approved health claims or simpli-\nfication of health claims: Several statements lacked the \nword \"normal\" or \"healthy\" in the context of the author -\nised health claim, e.g.\n\u2022 shortening the permissible statement \"Calcium and \nvitamin D are needed for healthy growth and bone \ndevelopment of children\" to \"Calcium and vitamin D \nfor growth and bone development\" (Fig. 9) or\n\u2022 Shortening the statement \"Vitamin A contributes to \nthe maintenance of normal vision\" to \"Vitamin A is \nimportant for vision\" (Fig. 10) or\n\u2022 Shortening the statement \"Vitamin D contributes to \na normal function of the immune system of chil-\ndren\" to \"with vitamin D for the immune system\" \n(Fig. 11). Although there was a number in brackets \nunder which the complete health claim was \nexplained on the reverse side, the consumer centres \nconsider that such clarifying references should be in \nthe same field of vision, or\n\u2022 Reinforcement of the statement \"Zinc/Selenium \ncontribute to a normal function of the immune \nsystem\" to \"The plus for the immune system. With \nzinc and selenium\". The correct health claim could \nnot be found on this product at all (Fig. 6).\nFigure 9: Health claim, inadmissible from the point of \nview of the consumer centres (Salus Kindervital\u00ae Spe -\ncial Tonic)\nFigure 10: Health claim, inadmissible from the point of \nview of consumer centres (Das Originale M\u00f6llers Ome -\nga-3 Kids)\nFigure 11: Health claim, inadmissible from the point of \nview of the consumer centres, on the front page (Kinder -\nImmun Dr. Wolz)\nStrengthening the admissible health claims: For some \nproducts, the admissible statement \"contributes to \nreducing fatigue\" has been reinforced by replacing the \nterm \"fatigue\" with \"exhaustion\" (Fig. 12).\nFigure 12: Health claim, inadmissible from the point of \nview of consumer centres (GSE Kinder Vital Complex and \nDoppelherz\u00ae system ENERGIE Multivitamine family)\nMarket check food supplements for children |13\nImportant: An admissible health claim does not neces-\nsarily mean that the food supplement is a meaning -\nful addition to the diet for everyone. The admissible \nclaims usually relate to nutrients which are ingested \nin sufficient quantities under normal conditions and in \na balanced and varied diet. An excessive intake of the \nnutrient above the necessary level is not accompanied \nby an additional or improved effect, in certain cases it \ncan even be harmful.\n4.2.3 \"Free of\" advertisement\nIn 20 out of 26 products, at least one \"free of\" advertise-\nment was found, which is marketed as additional health \nvalue. The most frequent indications were \"gluten-free\" \n(on 18 products) and \"lactose-free\" (on 14 products) or \nequivalent statements. By far most used were the claims \n\"no sugar\" (seven products - but then mostly the sweet -\nener sorbitol was used) and \"no colouring\" (six prod-\nucts) or equivalent claims followed.\n4.3. WARNINGS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE\nA further aim of the market check was to check whether \nthe legally prescribed references to the food supple-\nments were correctly indicated and, if necessary, \nwhether specific instructions for use could be found.\nAccording to paragraph 4 of the NemV, food supple-\nments must be labelled with the following information \n[28]:\n\u2022 Food supplements should not be used as a substi-\ntute for a balanced and varied diet and healthy life-\nstyle.\n\u2022 The recommended consumption must not be \nexceeded.\n\u2022 Keep out of the reach of small children.\nOn all of the products, the instructions found were accu-\nrate and legible.\nNine products were labelled as \"may cause laxative \neffects if consumed excessively\". This is mandatory for \nfoodstuffs containing more than 10 % polyhydric alco-\nhols (e.g. xylitol or sorbitol). If the sweetener aspartame \nis used, the words 'contains a source of phenylalanine' \nshall be printed on the product. This was the case with \nall four products.It was positively noted that three products were indi-\ncated as not being confectionery. In two products, the \nvoluntary statement \"Excessive consumption of vitamins \n(and minerals) can endanger health\" was also found. \n(Fig. 13).\nFigure 13: Products marked \"not confectionery\" (YaYa \nB\u00e4ren\u00ae Multivitamin, MUL TIVITAMIN HEVERT jelly drops \nand aronia+ KIDS)\n4.4. WIDE PRICE RANGE\nWhen calculating the cost of food supplements for chil-\ndren, significant differences were noted. The price range \nof the products covered ranged from 0.04 euros to 1.43 \neuros per daily dosage recommended by the producer. \nOn average, users of these products have to expect \nexpenditure of 0.54 euros per day or around 198 euros \nper year. The most expensive product in the market \ncheck, when used daily, costs a proud 522 euros a year \n(Fig. 14).\nFigure 14: Most expensive product of the market check \n(Orthomol junior Omega plus)| Market check food supplements for children14\n5.  CONCLUSION AND \nRECEIVABLES\nOn average, children in Germany are sufficiently supplied \nwith most vitamins and minerals. The D-A-CH reference \nvalues for folic acid, vitamin D, iron, iodine and calcium \nare not fully achieved. However, this does not mean that \naffected children develop a clinical nutrient deficiency. \nThe vitamin D supply is significantly improved by regu-\nlar, prolonged outdoor play, at least during the summer \nmonths. Fresh air, exercise and a varied diet with plenty \nof cereal products, potatoes, vegetables, fruit and dairy \nproducts, supplemented by meat, (sea) fish and eggs, \nhave been proven to contribute to the optimal develop-\nment of the child.\nChildren therefore usually do not need any food supple -\nments - neither in kindergarten nor at school.\nBut parents want to do good for their children and want \nthem to be better able to meet the challenges of modern \nchildren's everyday lives - especially if they are to be \nmore efficient than others or if they have learning diffi-\nculties or concentration problems. In our experience, \nthey are all too happy to believe in the sophisticated \nadvertising messages of the providers, who promise a \nsimple solution to the problem using pills or powders. \nThis supposedly simple solution can sometimes cost the \nparents a lot. In the current market check the costs, allot -\nted to food supplements for children, with regular intake, \nranged from approx. 15 to 522 Euro per year.\nThe problem for assessing the daily intake recom-\nmended by the producers is that there are no specific \nrecommendations from the BfR for children regard-\ning the maximum intake of certain nutrients via food \nsupplements [22]. In order to exclude risks due to exces-\nsive dosages, the BfR has derived maximum quantity \nrecommendations for adults. Maximum recommended \nquantities would also be important for the more sensi-\ntive metabolism of children. For the evaluation of the \ndosage recommendations, we used the D-A-CH refer -\nence values for the daily vitamin and mineral intake \nfor children aged four to seven years due to the lack of \ncorresponding maximum quantities recommended for \nchildren [21]. Although these values already include the \ntotal daily dietary intake (including food supplements), \nproducers design their products to contain twice or more \nof the recommended content per daily intake of a food supplement. Particularly critical is the fact that eleven \nof the 26 food supplements examined (42 percent) even \nexceed the maximum amounts of vitamins and minerals \nproposed by the BfR [22], which are intended for persons \naged 15 and above. Further six products reach the maxi-\nmum amount in food supplements for vitamin A or folic \nacid recommended by BfR.\nOverall, the dosages of the producers appear to be very \narbitrary and without a concept. If, for example, the DGE \nrecommends a daily intake of 30 mg of vitamin C for a \nchild between the ages of four and seven, which can \neasily be achieved through a normal diet, the products \nwe are looking at, range from 20 mg to 200 mg vitamin \nC per daily dosage. While the DGE recommends 10-15 \u00b5g \nbiotin per day for children of this age group [21], food \nsupplements contain between 10 and 150 \u00b5g per day.\nLegislators should set binding maximum levels for nutri -\nents in food supplements, taking into account the specific \nneeds of children. Against the background of the precau -\ntionary principle, consumer centres do not consider food \nsupplements for children to be a sufficiently safe product \ngroup until such a binding regulation is in place.\nIn the current market check, we found only one inad-\nmissible health claim, which is positive in comparison \nto other market checks. However, the number of claims \nwhich, from the point of view of the consumer centres, \nshould be examined by the food control authorities or \nthe courts was very high, at 39. These claims have been \nreinforced in wording or altered by adding or omitting \nwords. The monitoring authorities are called upon to take \nstronger action and punish the inadmissible claims in \naccordance with the HCVO.\nThe previous notification procedure must be replaced \nby an official examination and approval. This is the only \nway to guarantee the safety of the products and the accu -\nracy of the health claims. In view of the fact that around \none fifth of the products examined by the current market \ncheck were not even registered officially, this require-\nment is becoming ever more relevant.\nParents who buy food supplements for children should \npreventively be informed about the importance of a \nbalanced diet, sufficient sleep and exercise on the fresh \nair. Since food supplements are not medicine, parents \nshould know that they are not tested and approved for \nsafety by the authorities. Only then would they be able Market check food supplements for children |15\nto make a conscious decision and accept possible risks.\nParents should discuss health problems with their paedi -\natrician and only administer food supplements after \nconsultation with a doctor.| Market check food supplements for children16\n6.
