To respond to these challenges, non-profit hospitals may perform differently than public and for-profit hospitals because of their non-distribution constraint. Purposes: This study analyzes patient satisfaction data of non-profit teaching hospitals in comparison to teaching hospitals with for-profit and public ownership status. Patient satisfaction is assumed to be an indicator of how patient needs are met regardless of the teaching goals. Approach: The average patient satisfaction ratings for German hospitals (n = 1461) that were published on the \u2018klinikbewertungen.de\u2019 German hospital rating platform were collected for a cross-section analysis. Findings: The data show that non-profit teaching hospitals are better rated than for-profit and public teaching hospitals. Non-profit hospitals seem to be more competent in handling the balance between societies\u2019 needs for clinical training and patient needs for a favorable service experience. Practice implications: For-profits hospitals should revisit their business model once they get involved in the provision of public values such as education.", "sitename": "Taylor & Francis", "date": "2017-11-27", "id": null, "license": null, "body": null, "comments": "", "commentsbody": null, "raw_text": null, "text": "|Publikationstyp:||Beitrag in wissenschaftlicher Zeitschrift|\n|Art der Begutachtung:||Peer review (Publikation)|\n|Titel:||The balance of patient and learners needs in non-profit, public and for-profit teaching hospitals : an analysis of average patient satisfaction ratings of hospitals on a German hospital rating platform|\n|Autor/-in:|[10.1080/20479700.2017.1397251](https://doi.org/10.1080/20479700.2017.1397251)\n2047-9719\n370: Bildung und Erziehung\n[https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1445](https://digitalcollection.zhaw.ch/handle/11475/1445) [Publikationen School of Management and Law](/handle/11475/1093)\nDateien zu dieser Ressource:\nEs gibt keine Dateien zu dieser Ressource.\n[Zur Langanzeige](/handle/11475/1445?mode=full)\nLiberatore, F., Angerer, A., & Kriech, S.
