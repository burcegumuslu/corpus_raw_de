It is one of the most common female hormonal disorders, affecting one in ten women in Germany. The symptoms of this condition can be diverse and significantly impact quality of life. As this chronic condition requires lifelong management, naturopathy is becoming increasingly popular as a well-tolerated alternative. Discover whether it can provide relief here.\nPCOS is characterized by excessive male sex hormones (androgens). It occurs in women of reproductive age and is one of the most common endocrine disorders. Another term for this condition is Stein-Leventhal syndrome. Due to the wide-ranging influence of male sex hormones on various bodily processes, the symptoms can vary accordingly.\nPeople with PCOS often experience the following symptoms:\nAdditional effects of elevated levels of male sex hormones can include:\nThe intensity of these symptoms can vary due to different causes. The quantity of androgens, in particular, can differ among individuals with PCOS. Some individuals may have higher levels of androgens compared to others.\nThe diagnosis typically involves several examinations, as other conditions need to be ruled out. Initially, anamnesis takes place, which is the doctor's conversation where a detailed medical history is collected. You will be asked about symptoms, etc.\nIf there is a suspicion of PCOS, physical examinations follow. Signs of hirsutism, acne, or overweight are examined, among others. The ovaries can also be observed using ultrasound, potentially revealing the presence of polycystic ovaries.\nSubsequently, a hormonal analysis is conducted, which is possible through blood tests. Hormones such as testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, LH, and FSH are examined.\nThe doctor must then rule out other illnesses, which may require further tests. If no other cause for your symptoms is found, the diagnosis of PCOS is confirmed.\nTreatment for PCOS is now quite possible. Medical professionals have various options available. They will determine the best treatment for you during your doctor's appointment. The following methods are typically applied:\nUnfortunately, some women don't find relief with these methods. However, we recommend discussing and trying conventional medical approaches with your doctor in any case. Ideally, naturopathy should be used in addition to these approaches. Many affected women find the holistic approach of naturopathy beneficial. It's important to note that the following approaches lack medical evidence for their effectiveness. These are traditional methods explained through experiences.\nDietary changes are a typical method. Naturopaths or doctors are consulted for this. A low FODMAP diet might be helpful.\nPhytotherapy is another approach. It's hoped that certain herbs and plants could have a regulatory effect on hormone levels. Typically, herbs like\n[ Fenugreek](https://bitterkraft.com/ratgeber/kraeuterkunde/bockshornklee-wirkung-und-mehr), chasteberry, and lady's mantle are recommended.\nAcupuncture might help according to the Meridian theory to influence the body's energy flow. This method belongs to Traditional Chinese Medicine.\nRelaxation techniques and stress management are employed because stress might worsen PCOS symptoms. Relaxing meditations, yoga, or autogenic training are typical approaches. Within this context, exercise could also be beneficial, such as aiding weight regulation.\nDietary supplements might be useful as complementary therapy. You should discuss this with your doctor if needed.\nUltimately, you need to work out an individual treatment plan with your doctor that works for your case. Relying solely on naturopathy likely won't yield the desired results. Often, naturopathy is used in addition. Feel free to discuss this with your doctor to receive a tailored treatment.\nPolycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is caused by an excess of male sex hormones (androgens) in the female body. This primarily leads to the development of polycystic ovaries, which can be painful. Irregular ovulation along with irregular menstrual cycles are other characteristic symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome.\nNaturopathy offers several approaches that can be beneficial as complementary to conventional treatment. It's important that appropriate treatment should be discussed with a doctor to maintain the highest possible quality of life. The following approaches are typically recommended in naturopathy:\nHowever, these approaches lack medical evidence. They are not supported by studies and are often based on tradition and anecdotal experiences.", "language": null, "image":
