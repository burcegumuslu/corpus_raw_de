In particular, a flexible procedure for the generation of insurers\u2019 compressed contract portfolios that respects the given biometric structure is presented, extending the existing literature on stochastic ALM modeling.

Efficient simulations are obtained by integrating new policies into existing cohorts according to contract-related criteria. We provide new results on the consistency of the balance sheet equations.
