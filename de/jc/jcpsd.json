This secondary analysis from an\nobservational study comprised 529 children <18 years from Europe (AT, DE, NL, and UK) or USA, whose caregivers had chosen\nto consult physicians offering anthroposophic (A-) or conventional (C-) treatment for RTI/OM. During the 28-day follow-upantibiotics were prescribed to 5.5% of A-patients and 25.6% of C-patients ( \ud835\udc43<0.001 ); unadjusted odds ratio for nonprescription\nin A- versus C-patients 6.58 (95%-CI 3.45\u201312.56); after adjustment for demographics and morbidity 6.33 (3.17\u201312.64). Antibiotic\nprescriptionratesinrecentobservationalstudieswithsimilarpatientsinsimilarsettings,rangedfrom31.0%to84.1%.Compared\nto C-patients, A-patients also had much lower use of analgesics, somewhat quicker symptom resolution, and higher caregiversatisfaction. Adverse drug reactions were infrequent (2.3% in both groups) and not serious. Limitation was that results apply to\nchildren of caregivers who consult A-physicians. One cannot infer to what extent antibiotics might be avoided in children who\nusuallyreceiveC-treatment,iftheywereofferedA-treatment.\n1. Background\n1.1. Acute Respiratory Tract Infections and Otitis Media (RTI/\nOM).Acute respiratory tract infections and otitis media\n(RTI/OM) are frequent among children [ 1]a n da r ec o m -\nmonly treated with antibiotics [ 2\u20138]. In randomised trials,\nantibioticshaveonlysmallornegligibleshort-termeffectsonOM and RTI such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, laryngitis, andcommon cold, comparable to their side-effect potential [ 9\u2013\n12]. Antibiotic treatment as secondary prophylaxis in order\nto prevent complications of RTI/OM is difficult to justifyin developed countries, where these complications are rare[13,14]. Furthermore, antibiotic use increases antimicrobial\nresistance[ 15],increasestherecurrencerateofOM[ 16],and\nmay be a risk factor for paediatric asthma [ 17\u201320], atopic\neczema [21], and inflammatory bowel disease [ 22\u201324]. The\nEuropeanCommissionhasrecentlyproposedanactionplan\nagainsttherisingthreatsfromantimicrobialresistance,which\nis estimated to cause 25,000 human deaths as well as extrahealthcare costs and productivity losses of at least 1.5 billion\nEuroannually[ 25].\nBecause of these concerns, reduction of antibiotic pre-\nscription for RTI/OM has long been advocated [ 26\u201330].\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\nVolume 2014, Article ID 243801, 17 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/2438012 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine\nStrategies to reduce antibiotic use include educational inter-\nventions towards physicians and patients [ 31], rapid antigen\ntesting to identify viral disease [ 32], and delayed antibiotic\nprescription [ 33,34].Inaddition,usinganalgesicsinsteadof\nantibiotics has been recommended [ 35], but analgesics may\nalsoposerisks[ 36\u201341].\n1.2. Complementary Treatment for RTI/OM, Background for\nthis Study Analysis. Some physicians prescribe complemen-\ntary treatment for children with RTI/OM, such as herbal[42\u201344], homeopathic [ 45\u201347], or anthroposophic [ 48\u201351]\nmedicinalproducts.Complementarytreatmentmightreducethe need for antibiotics, but antibiotic reduction shouldn o tb ea c c o m p a n i e dw i t hd e l a y e ds h o r tt e r mr e c o v e r yo r\nincreasedcomplicationrates[ 52].Wehavepreviouslyinves-\ntigated these issues in a prospective observational studyin primary care, showing low antibiotic use with at leastcomparable short-term resolution in adults and childrentreated for RTI/OM by physicians offering treatment withanthroposophic medicine (AM, see Section1.3 ), compared\ntophysiciansofferingconventionaltreatment[ 53].However,\nin the primary analysis adults and children were assessedtogether[ 53].Thereisaspecificneedfordataonmedication\nuse and safety in children [ 54]a n dt h ep r o b l e mo fi n a p p r o -\npriateuseofantibioticsforRTI/OMisparticularlypertinentin children, for several reasons (high prevalence of RTI/OMandassociatedantibioticprescription,lackofdetaileddataonantibiotic use and resistance, and special issues in childrensuch as parental or physician anxiety for complications andparentalstressfromattendancetothesickchild[ 55]).Onthe\notherhand,studieswithchildrencanbedifficulttoconduct,again because of special issues with children such as ethicalconcerns[ 56].\nWethereforeperformedasecondaryanalysisofthestudy\nsubgroup of children with a special focus on antibiotic use.Since antibiotic use for RTI/OM in children has to someextent diminished after the data in our study were collectedin 1999-2000 [ 2\u20138,57], we also compared antibiotic use in\nour study analysis descriptively to antibiotic use in recent\nobservationalstudiesofchildrenwithRTI/OM.\n1.3. Anthroposophic Medicine and Childhood Infections. AM\nis a physician-provided integrative multimodal therapy sys-tem founded by Steiner and Wegman [ 58]. AM is based on\nthecognitivemethodsandcognitiveresultsofanthroposophy\n[59].Accordingtotheanthroposophicunderstandingofman\nand nature, four different classes of formative forces canbe discerned as follows: (1) in minerals, formative forces ofphysicochemical matter; (2) in plants, formative vegetativeforces interact with material forces, bringing about andmaintainingthelivingform;(3)inanimalswithsensoryandmotorsystemsandwithacorrespondinginnerlife,afurtherclass of formative forces (anima, soul) interact with materialand vegetative forces; (4) in the human organism with itsindividual mind and capacity of thinking, another class offormative forces (Geist, spirit) interact with the material,vegetative,andanimalforces.Theinteractionsoftheseforcesareunderstoodtovarybetweendifferentregionsandorgansin the human body, resultingin a complex equilibrium[ 59].\nThisequilibriumcanbedistortedinvariousformsofhumandisease. Acute RTI/OM and other childhood infections areseen as part of a developmental process, involving theworkingofthespiritualforcesonthematerialandvegetativeforces. Accordingly, fever is not routinely suppressed with\nanalgesics, and antibiotics are only prescribed if strongly\nneeded.Foralleviationoffeverandothersymptoms,priorityis given to AM medications and nonmedication treatmentsuch as steam inhalations, nasal lavage, and various externalapplications (cold dressings on legs to lower temperature,localcompresses,etc.)[ 60\u201364].\nAM medications are prepared from plants, minerals,\nanimals, and from chemically defined substances accordingto Good Manufacturing Practice and national drug regula-tions; quality standards of raw materials and manufacturingmethods are described in the Anthroposophic Pharmaceu-tical Codex [ 65]. Toxicologically relevant starting materials\n(e.g.,aconite,cinnabar)arehighlydilutedaccordingtosafetyrequirements of European regulations [ 66]. The available\nevidence suggests that AM medications are generally welltolerated, with infrequent adverse reactions of mostly mildtomoderateseverity[ 67,68].\nAM treatment for RTI/OM can be standardised (e.g.,\noneAMmedicationforagivenindication)orindividualised(tailored to individual needs, involving one or several AMmedicationsand/ornonmedicationAMtherapies)[ 62\u201364].\n2. Methods\n2.1. Design, Objective, and Research Questions. Th i si sa\nsubgroup analysis of data from a prospective observationalcomparativestudyinprimarycare(IIPCOS-Anthroposophy,International Integrative Primary Care Outcomes Study)[53]. The IIPCOS-Anthroposophy study comprised adults\nand children treated for acute RTI/OM under routine pri-mary care conditions. Two patient groups were compared,according to the treatment offered by the physicians whomthe patients or caregivers consulted: physicians offering AMtherapy (A-physicians) and physicians offering conventionaltherapy(C-physicians).Adescriptive,unadjustedanalysisofclinicaloutcomesinadultsandchildrenwaspreplannedand\nhas been summarised in the primary publication [ 53], while\nthe present detailed analysis of the children, with a specialfocusonantibioticuse,wassecondary.\nThe objective of this analysis was to compare antibiotic\nu s ei nc h i l d r e nt r e a t e df o rR T I / O Mu n d e rr o u t i n ep r i m a r ycareconditionsbyA-physiciansorC-physicians,respectively,and to investigate factors associated with antibiotic use.

A-physicians (prescribingAM medications to at least 75% of patients with acuteRTI/OM) were recruited through national AM physicians\u2019associations;C-physicians(notprescribingAMmedications)were recruited by HomInt research network. Patients weretreatedaccordingtothephysicians\u2019discretion.\nInclusioncriteriaforthisanalysiswere(1)age \u22651monthto\n17years(inTheNetherlandstheloweragelimitwas4yearsasrequestedbythelocalethicscommittee),(2)chiefcomplaintof sore throat, cough, or ear pain, and (3) onset of chiefcomplaint within 7 days.

Further Outcomes. Further outcomes were prescription\nof other medications, compliance with medication prescrip-tion, response, and recovery at day 28, caregiver satisfactionwith the physician, adverse drug reactions, and seriousadverseevents.\n2.5.DataCollection.

On days 7,14, and 28, caregivers were interviewed by telephone abouttreatment outcome, time to first improvement (number ofhours or days), medication use and safety, and caregiversatisfaction. The interviewers were not blinded towards thetreatment setting (AM or conventional); caregivers wereinformed about the planned comparison of treatment regi-mens. The caregivers\u2019 responses were not made available tothephysicians.\n2.6.DataAnalysis\n2.6.1. Comparison of Anthroposophic and Conventional\nGroups in This Study. Patients fulfilling all eligibility criteria\nwith at least one follow-up interview were included inthe analysis. Data analysis was performed using IBMSPSS Statistics 19 (International Business Machines Corp.,Armonk, NY, USA) and StatXact 9.0.0 (Cytel SoftwareCorporation,Cambridge,MA,USA).\nFor patients with complete recovery on days 7 or 14,\nstudy participation was terminated and last observationswere carried forward for analysis of subsequent follow-ups.Follow-up data missing for other reasons were also replacedby last observation carried forward, when available. Other-wise,missingdatawerenotreplaced.\nBivariate analyses of independent samples were per-\nformedusingFisher\u2019sexacttestfordichotomousdata,Fisher-\nFreeman-Halton test for multinomial data, and \ud835\udc61-test for\ncontinuousdata,unlessotherwisestated.

In the A-group, no significant difference was found\nbetween antibiotic prescription rates in patients treated bygeneral practitioners (4.0%,\ud835\udc5b=6/149 ), internists (14.3%,\n\ud835\udc5b=1/7), and pediatricians (5.2%,\ud835\udc5b=15/287 ), respectively\n(Kruskal-Wallis test\ud835\udc43=0.448 ). Further subgroup analyses\nandadjustedanalysesofantibioticprescriptionarepresentedinthesection\u201cMainOutcomes,\u201dbelow.\n3.5.2. Descriptive Comparison to Antibiotic Use in Other\nStudies.Antibiotic prescription rates in this study were also\ncompared to antibiotic prescription rates in recent observa-tional studies of children with acute RTI/OM (see Methodsfor details). The literature searches identified 36 potentiallyeligiblestudiespublished2006\u20132012.Ofthese,25studiesdidnot fulfil the eligibility criteria, for the following reasons: nodata on children (\ud835\udc5b=7studies), other country than in this\nstudy (\ud835\udc5b=12), no data on diagnoses of this study ( \ud835\udc5b=4),\nno data on antibiotic prescription rates ( \ud835\udc5b=2). Elevenstudies [2,7,8,75\u201382] with a total of 16 diagnosis groups\n(cough/tracheitis/bronchitis:\ud835\udc5b=2, sore throat/pharyngitis:\n\ud835\udc5b=2, ear pain/otitis:\ud835\udc5b=6, Upper RTI/RTI:\ud835\udc5b=6)w e r e\neligibleforcomparisons(furtherdatain Table 5).All16com-\nparison groups had higher antibiotic prescription rates thanthe corresponding C-, and A-groups of this study ( Figure1).\nAntibioticprescriptionratesrangedfrom31.0%(nonspecific\nRTI[7])to84.1%(OM[ 77]).ComparedtotheratesintheA-\ngroups,prescriptionratesinthecomparisongroupswere6.7\n[80]to13.3[77]timeshigherforcough/bronchitis,26.2[ 77]\nto 29.2 [81] times higher for sore throat/pharyngitis, 6.1 [ 75]\nto 12.2 [77,79] times higher for ear pain/OM, and 6.9 [ 7]t o\n15.1[78]timeshigherforupperRTI/RTI.\n3.6.OtherTherapies\n3.6.1. Analgesics. On days 0\u201328, analgesics were prescribed\nto 25.6% (\ud835\udc5b=22/86 ) of C-patients and 5.0% (\ud835\udc5b=22/443 )\nof A-patients (see also Supplementary Table 1). Analgesicsprescribed on days 0\u201328 were paracetamol (11 A-patients +22 C-patients) and choline salicylate ( 3+0). Odds ratio (A-\nversus C-group) for nonprescription of analgesics on days0\u201328 after adjustment for seven prognostic variables (seeMethods) was 12.11 (95%-CI 5.50\u201326.69).

Anthroposophic Medications, External Applications.\nAM medications were prescribed to all A-patients and noC-patient. A total of 207 different AM medications wereprescribed throughout the study; the most frequent AMmedications were Plantago Bronchial Balm (prescribed to\ud835\udc5b=101/443 A-patients,22.8%),Erysidoron1Liquid(20.1%),\nCinnabar comp. Powder (17.8%), Pine Reviving Bath Milk(11.3%),StictaLiquid(10.6%),andAconitumcomp.Eardrops\n(9.7%). External applications were prescribed to 30.9% ( \ud835\udc5b=\n137/443) of A-patients; this item was not documented in C-\npatients.\n3.6.3. Other Medications.

Two variables (gender, con-\ncomitant disease at baseline) were not significant regressorsinanymodel.Re-analysiswithoutthesetwovariablesyieldedresults very similar to the main analysis. All seven variableswere therefore included in the final models. As in theunadjusted analyses, all adjusted OR favoured the A-group,with significant differences for all outcomes except recoveryon day 7. Compared to the unadjusted OR, the adjustedOR were very similar (<10% increase or decrease) in seven\nanalyses,theywereincreasedbyatleast10%intwoanalyses,andweredecreasedbyatleast10%inoneanalysis( Table 6).\n3.7.2. Sensitivity Analyses. In a sensitivity analysis (SA [a],\nSupplementary Table 4), unadjusted and adjusted OR formain outcomes were calculated after restriction of theanalysed sample to patients from Austria, Germany, TheNetherlands, and the UK, since no C-patients were enrolledin the USA. Results were very similar to results of the mainanalyses(<10%changeofORineightanalyses,ORincreased\nbyatleast10%intwoanalyses).\nIn further sensitivity regression analyses, one indepen-\ndent variable was substituted for another variable: baselineseverity of chief complaint was substituted for baselinesymptomscore(SA[b],SupplementaryTable5),thenumberof previous episodes of chief complaint was substituted forthe dichotomized variable (previous episodes: yes/no) (SA[c], Supplementary Table 5), and a concomitant respiratorydisorder was substituted for any concomitant disorder (SA[d],SupplementaryTable5).SA[b]andSA[c]yieldedresultsvery similar to the main analyses ( <10% change in 19 of 20\nanalyses),whileinSA[d],ORwereincreasedbyatleast10%infouranalysesandshowed<10%changeinsixanalyses.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 9\n0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0Ashworth 2006Uijen 2011This study-conventionalThis study-anthroposophyAshworth 2006Harnden 2007This study-conventionalThis study-anthroposophyAshworth 2006Coco 2009Abbas 2010 (suppurative otitis)Plaschaert 2006Uijen 2011Abbas 2010 (nonsuppurative otitis)This study-conventionalThis study-anthroposophyChung 2007Ashe 2006Zuckerman 2007Abbas 2010Van Deursen 2012Meropol 2009This study-conventionalThis study-anthroposophyCough/tracheo- Sore throat/pharyngitis Ear pain/otitis (Upper) respiratory tract infectionAntibiotic prescription rates\n(%)bronchitis\nFigure 1: Comparison to other studies.

Treatment by A-physicians was\nassociated with much lower use of antibiotics (prescribedto 5% versus 26% of A- and C-patients, respectively, duringthefour-weekfollow-up)andalsoanalgesics/antipyretics(3%versus26%).Althoughdatahadbeencollectedin1999-2000and antibiotic prescription for RTI/OM has reportedly been\nreducedsincethen,antibioticprescriptionratesinthisstudy\n(overall 8%, in A-patients 5%) were still much lower thanin similar observational studies of RTI/OM from 2006\u20132012(range 31% to 84%). There was no safety problem associatedwith either of the two treatment regimens, and AM therapywasnotassociatedwithdelayedrecoveryinanysubgroup.Onthecontrary,A-patientshadsomewhatquickerimprovementandrecoveryaswellashighercaregiversatisfaction.\nAll these differences (antibiotic and analgesic prescrip-\ntion, improvement, recovery, caregiver satisfaction) re-mained after adjustment for age, gender, chief complaint,and four markers of baseline severity. Furthermore, thedifferences could not be explained by A-caregivers beingmore confident in the A-physicians\u2019 professional skills or byA-physicianshavinglongerconsultationsthanC-physicians.\n4.2. Strengths and Limitations. Strengths of this study and\nthepresentanalysisincludeadetailedassessmentofbaselinestatus; the inclusion of patients from a range of therapysettings(25practices,20municipalities);thedocumentationofroutinediagnosticsandtreatmentinprimarycaresettingswithout experimental constraints; and the widespread useof sensitivity analyses. Whereas in many other antibioticprescription studies the available data are limited to dem-ographics, diagnoses, and prescriptions, a strength of thisstudy is the prospective documentation of treatment andoutcomes during a follow-up period of four weeks, whichis long for acute RTI/OM. This documentation enabled theassessment also of safety (adverse reactions, complicationsof RTI/OM, possible delayed short-term resolution due topossible under-prescription of necessary antibiotics in A-patients), which is an important finding, since AM therapyforRTI/OMhasnotbeenstudiedextensively.\nNotably, this was not an experimental investigation of\nspecific intervention effects; the research questions con-cerned behaviour (antibiotic prescription) in two differentsettings under naturalistic conditions. For this type of epi-demiological question (one variable observed under twodifferent conditions), the comparative observational study\ndesignwithstatisticalanalysistocontrolforconfounding,as\ndonehere,isastandardmethod[ 74,84\u201387].\nTheobjectofthestudywasanintegrativewholemedical\nsystem (AM, including physician advice, AM medications,nonmedication treatment, and conventional therapy includ-ing antibiotics if necessary). The research questions of thep r e s e n ta n a l y s i sc o r r e s p o n dt ot h et w ofi r s ts t a g e so fap r o -posedfive-stagestrategyforassessmentofwholemedicalsys-tems[69]:stageI-descriptionofthesystemanditstreatment\nmodalities (here: use of antibiotics and other medications);stage II - safety of the whole system. Notably, at the stages I-IIthewholesystemisaddressed,whereascomponentsofthesystemareinvestigatedatsubsequentstages.Inthisstudy,thewholesystemencompassednotonlythe\u201cAMtherapyproper\u201d\n(i.e.,theconsultationwiththeA-physiciansandthetreatmentprescribed by them) but also the caregivers who had chosento consult the A-physicians, and the patients. Hence, anydifferences in antibiotic prescription between A- and C-patients may have been influenced by: [a] the \u201cAM therapy\nproper\u201d, [b] any specific features of the families choosing\ntreatment by an A-physician (e.g., life-style, motivation,treatmentexpectations),and[c]generaldemographicfactorsandbaselinemorbidityofthepatients.\nInthepresentanalysis,adjustmentfordemographicsand\nbaseline morbidity was straightforward, as the relevant vari-ableshadbeendocumented(furtherdiscussionunderneath).The possibilities for adjustment for caregiver characteristicswere, however, limited to two variables: The first variable,caregivers\u2019 confidence in the physicians\u2019 professional skills,w a sh i g h e ri nt h eA - g r o u p ,b u tt h a tc o u l dn o te x p l a i nt h edifference in antibiotic description (additional adjustmentf o rt h i sv a r i a b l el e a dt oe v e nl a r g e rd i ff e r e n c e s ) .Th es e c o n dvariable was the question \u201cDo you have confidence that thetreatment your child will receive will solve his/her medicalproblem?\u201d, which was answered by \u201cyes\u201d in all but two casesand which therefore could not be used for adjustment. Pos-sibly, the dichotomised response possibility of \u201cyes/no\u201d wastoo simplistic and insensitive to more gradual differences intreatment expectations. As regards the \u201cAM therapy proper\u201dcomplex, the dataset allowed for analysis of one therapyfactor: consultationlength, which also could not explain thedifferenceinantibioticprescription.\nNotably, in the stages I-II of a system evaluation, these\nlimitations are common and are accepted; main focus of\ninterest are the characteristics of the entire system as such,whereasthedisentanglementof\u201cpure\u201dtreatmenteffectsver-sus\u201cnonspecific\u201deffectsofexpectations,caregiverbehaviour,andsoforthcomessecond.Thisaffectsthegeneralisabilityofour findings: the results of this analysis apply to patients ofcaregivers who consult A-physicians. One cannot infer fromtheresultstowhatextentantibioticsandanalgesicsmightbeavoided in children who usually receive conventional care,if they should be offered AM treatment. For example, theAM approach may require more active engagement thanconventionaltherapy,suchasfrequentdosingofmedicationand extended nursing with application of compresses andfootbaths [ 63,64]. For many caregivers, this may not be\nfeasibleoracceptable.\nOn the other hand, the group of caregivers willing to\nengageinatreatmentstrategyforchildhoodRTI/OMrelyingless on antibiotics, is not necessarily limited to people witha strong attachment to AM or complementary therapy: Thecaregivers can visit A-physicians with their children fordifferentreasons,suchasgeographicalproximity,recommen-dation from family or friends, dissatisfaction with anotherphysician, or because they deliberately choose AM or com-plementary therapy. This question was not documented in\nthe study, so it could not be further assessed. Notably, in\nGerman-speaking countries, the AM approach to RTI/OMin children is well-known; it is described in the standardGerman-language physicians\u2019 textbooks for anthroposophic[88]andintegrativepaediatrics[ 89],respectivelyaswellasinEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 13\nseveral parents guidebooks to complementary treatment for\nchildren [ 90,91], one of which has been sold in more than 1\nmillioncopies[ 91].\nInthisstudy,medicationprescriptionsweredocumented\nby the physicians at baseline and by caregivers in telephoneinterviews during follow-up. Physicians\u2019 prescription data\nwerecheckedwiththepatientfilesduringmonitorvisitsand\nshouldthereforebeaccurate.Patientdocumentationofmed-ications prescribed during follow-up as well as compliancewith prescription was not subject to monitoring; therefore,biased reporting of antibiotic prescription and use duringfollow-up cannot be excluded. Since the interviewers werenotblindedtowardsthetreatmentsetting,reportingbiasonpart of them can also not be excluded. However, this biasseems unlikely, because none of the interviewers had anyfinancial or personal ties to any treatment regimen or anyphysician[ 53].\nC-patients had a much higher use of antibiotics than\nA-patients, but this cannot explain the somewhat slowerimprovementandrecoveryofC-patients.Ifantibioticsshouldhave detrimental short term effects on RTI and OM inchildren, one would expect the antibiotic groups in ran-domised trials of RTI/OM to have slower improvement andrecovery, compared to the control groups. This is not thecase, placebo-controlled randomised trials of RTI/OM inchildren consistently show similar or quicker resolution intheantibioticgroups,comparedtotheplacebogroups[ 9\u201312].\nA total of 4.5% of the A-patients and 8.1% of the C-\npatients had no antibiotic prescription on day 0 but had aprescriptionondays1\u201328.Whetherthiswasduetoadelayed\nprescription at baseline or due to an emerging need for\nantibiotictreatment during follow-up cannot be assessed, asthestudydocumentationdidnotdiscernbetweenimmediateanddelayedprescription.\nAs in all comparative epidemiological studies there is\nthe issue of confounding by baseline differences. In thisstudy sample, some relevant morbidity variables differedbetween the groups at baseline but were adjusted for (chiefcomplaintofearpain,durationofchiefcomplaint,symptomintensity,andconcomitantrespiratorydisorders).Thegroupsalso differed regarding participating countries, which wasnot adjusted for in this paediatric subgroup analysis sincethe analysed sample had less than ten C-patients in three ofthe five countries. However, exclusion of the children fromthe USA (with no C-patients) yielded similar results in thispaediatric sample. Furthermore, in the full sample of adultsandchildren,theadjustmentforcountryhadnoperceptibleinfluence on the outcomes [ 53] .An u m b e ro fo t h e rf a c t o r s\ndid not differ between the groups (including gender, age,chief complaints of sore throat or cough, recurrent chiefcomplaints, and fever). Nonetheless, our adjustment modelsare,likeallstatisticaladjustmentmodels,imperfectrepresen-tations of reality [ 92], and residual confounding cannot be\nruled out. Furthermore, since this is a secondary subgroup\nanalysis,resultsarehypothesis-generating,notconfirmative.\nOntheotherhand,thedifferencesinantibioticandanalgesicprescription seem much too large (OR >6f o rn oa n t i b i o t i c s\nand OR>12 for no analgesics in all models) to be explained\nbyconfounding.To sum up: This analysis was a naturalistic comparison\nof two different treatment systems applied under routineconditions. The research questions addressed features ofAM treatment for children whose caregivers had chosen toconsultphysiciansofferingthistherapy.Theanalysisshowed,after considering relevant confounders and adjusting for\nthemasfaraspossible,thatchildrentreatedbyA-physicians\nused much less antibiotics and analgesics/antipyretics. TheAM treatment entailed no safety problem and was notassociatedwithdelayedshort-termrecovery.Onthecontrary,A-patientshadsomewhatquickershort-termresolutionthanC-patients. However, the study and the present analysiscannottellustowhatextentantibioticsandanalgesicscouldhave been avoided among the C-patients, if they had beenoffered AM treatment. Likewise, an effectiveness evaluationon the level of individual AM medications was beyond thescopeofthissystemevaluationstudy[ 83,93].\n4.3. Interpretation, Relation to Previously Published Work.\nTh i sa n a l y s i ss h o w e dav e r yl o wu s eo fa n t i b i o t i c sa n danalgesicsinchildrentreatedforRTI/OMbyAMphysicians,without detrimental effects. The study data were collectedin 1999-2000, and antibiotic use for RTI/OM in childrenhas since then been reduced. However, naturalistic studiesof children with RTI/OM published in the period 2006\u20132012 still show antibiotic prescription rates 6 to 29 timeshigher than in the A-patients with corresponding diagnoses(Figure1).\nThe very low antibiotic use in A-patients in this study is\nconsistentwithfindingsfromalargemulticentreprospectiveobservationalstudyinAMprimarycaresettingsinGermany,in which antibiotics were prescribed to 5.8% of 14,945 caseswithupperRTIin8,900childrenondays0\u201315[ 51].Similarly,\ntwo smaller prospective observational studies from singleAM practices reported very low antibiotic prescription ratesin mixed groups of adults and children (1.5% of 132 caseswith OM with fever [ 48], 7.5% of 329 cases with suppurative\ntonsillitis [ 50] ) ,w i t h o u ts a f e t yp r o b l e m s .L o wu s eo fa n t i b i -\notics and analgesics has also been found in children with\nan anthroposophic life-style (children attending Waldorfschools[94,95] and children attending an AM child welfare\ncentre[96]).\nAntibiotic [ 17\u201324] and analgesic/antipyretic [ 38\u201341]u s e\nin early childhood are putative risk factors for allergic andautoimmunediseases.Inwell-controlledpaediatricepidemi-ological studies, an anthroposophic life-style (including lowuse of antibiotics and antipyretics and a diet containingfermented vegetables) was associated with a reduced riskfor atopic disease [ 94,95] and with differences in intestinal\nbacterialflora[ 96].\n4.4. Implications for Practice and Research. According to\nthe results of this analysis, AM treatment for RTI/OM inchildren whose caregivers choose this therapy is safe andassociated with a very low use of antibiotics and analgesics,compared to current practice in conventional primary caresettings. This raises the issue if some elements of the AMapproach to RTI/OM might also be utilized in conventional14 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine\nmedicalsettings.Inthiscontext,futurestudiesofAMtherapy\nfor RTI/OM in children in order to further characterisethe components of AM treatment, such as the type ofexternal applications, other advice given to caregivers, andtheAMmedications,couldbehelpful.Othertopicsofinterestincludelong-termtreatmentofrecurrentRTI/OMandhealth\neconomics.RandomisedtrialsaredifficulttoconductinAM\nsettings,chieflybecausethephysician-patient-relationshipisdisturbed by randomisation and because of strong therapypreferences[ 53,97].However,somecomponentsofAMther-\napyforRTI/OMarestandardisedandcanalsobeprescribedbyphysicianswithoutextensiveknowledgeofAMprinciples(e.g., individual AM medications [ 98,99] or nonmedication\ntherapies[ 100]).Studyresultswouldseemtowarrantatesting\nofsuchtherapycomponentsalsoinnon-AMsettings.\n5. Conclusions\nThis analysis from a prospective observational study underroutine primary care conditions showed a very low use ofantibioticsandanalgesics/antipyreticsinchildrentreatedforRTI/OM by physicians offering AM therapy, compared tocurrentpracticeinconventionaltherapysettings(antibioticsprescribed to 5% versus 26% of A- and C-patients, respec-tively,duringdays0\u201328;antipyreticsprescribedto3%versus26%).TheAMtreatmententailednosafetyproblemandwasnot associated with delayed short-term recovery. These dif-ferencescouldnotexplainedbydifferencesindemographicsor baseline morbidity. The low antibiotic use is consistentwithfindingsfromotherstudiesofpaediatricRTI/OMinAM\nsettings.\nNotably, the results of this analysis apply to patients of\ncaregivers who consult A-physicians.
