The various viable options include flexibly dispatchable power plants as well as storage systems or the balancing of power demand and power feed-in (demand-side management). The challenge is to identify the options combining stability, sustainability, cost efficiency and social acceptability.\nA working group of the Academies\u2019 Project \"Energy Systems of the Future\" (ESYS) has developed a special model enabling the comparison of 130 different constellations. The position paper published by acatech, the National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and the Union of the German Academies of Sciences and Humanities summarises the main findings and presents design options for energy policies.\nHead of Department Science \u2013 Policy \u2013 Society, Head of Berlin Office\n|Phone||030 203 8997 - 865|\n|Fax|\n|elmar.koenig (at)leopoldina.org|", "language": null,
