The analysis shows how  journalists,  and their 11 \ninterpretations and professional norms , shape media debates  about climate change. The study  links 12 \nan analysis of media content to a survey of the authors of the respective articles . It covers  leading 13 \nprint and online news outlets in Germany, India, the United Kingdom , the United States , and 14 \nSwitzerland. It finds that climate journalism has moved beyond the norm of balance towards  a more 15 \ninterpretive pattern  of journalism. Quoting contrarian voices still is part of transnational climate 16 \ncoverage, but these quotes are contextualized with a  dismissal of climate change denial. Y et niches of 17 \ndenial persist in certain contexts , and much journalistic attention is focused on the narrative  of 18 \n\u2018warners vs. deniers ,\u2019 and overlooks  the more relevant debates about  climate change.  19 \nKeywords:  20 \nClimate change; journalism; skeptics; denial; journalistic norms; balance   21 \n1 \n 1. Introduction  22 \nWhile scientific consensus on  anthropogenic climate change has been growing in recent  23 \ndecades  (Anderegg et al., 2010; Cook et al., 2013; Oreskes, 2004) , public opinion  has also become  24 \nincreasingly uncertain about the urgency of climate change as a problem (Patt and Weber, 2014; 25 \nRatter et al., 2012) . Citizens of the biggest carbon emitters of the world (the United States  and China) 26 \nare even less concerned about climate change than people from other countries  (PEW, 2015) . 27 \nOutright denial of climate change persists among salient  minorities in the United States , United 28 \nKingdom,  and Australia,  and in small niche publics in other countries  (Capstick and Pidgeon, 2014; 29 \nEuropean Commission, 2014; Leiserowitz et al., 2013, 2013; Whitmarsh, 2011) . One reason for this 30 \nentrenched denialism  in public opinion may be the way the media portray the scientific consensus on 31 \nclimate change as represented by the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 32 \n(IPCC). By providing a forum  for contrarian views , the media \u201cperpetuate the myth of a lack of 33 \ninternational scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change \u2014and thereby succeed in 34 \nmaintai ning public confusion\u201d (Antilla, 2005: 350) . Various studies have shown t he detrimental 35 \neffec ts of \u2018balanced\u2019 media coverage that depict climate change as an open debate between 36 \n\u2018skeptics\u2019 and \u2018warners\u2019  (with regards to public debates about vaccines, see: Dixon and Clarke, 2013; 37 \nLewandowsky et al., 2013) . Thus, t he study of media content and its influencing  factors  is not only 38 \nrelevant for scholars of journalism, but also for everyone seeking to understand how societies 39 \nstruggle to  deal with the challenge o f climate change.  40 \nOur study  tackle s this challenge by analyz ing how  the IPCC stance on  climate change and its 41 \nchallengers are covered in different journalistic media. We seek to explain  different patterns of 42 \nmedia content by taking into account the influen ce of different editorial and national contexts . The 43 \nstudy contributes to our understanding of  how and why contrarian views remain salient in media 44 \ndebates. It is based on a content analysis of articles ( N = 936) published in four different types of 45 \nleading news outlets ( left-leaning, right -leaning , regional, online) in five countries (Germany, India, 46 \nSwitzerland, United Kingdom , United States ), and is complemented by a survey of the authors of 47 \nthese articles. We  argue that a common explanation for th e prese nce of climate change denial  in 48 \nmedia coverage \u2013 adherence to the journalistic norm of balance (Boykoff and Boykoff, 2004)  \u2013 can no 49 \nlonger be regarded as the most powerful driver of climate coverage . Instead we find a transnational 50 \npattern of interpretive journalism that puts the denial of anthropogenic climate change in to context.  51 \n2. Analytical framework  and state of research: journalists\u2019 role in the climate debate  52 \nTo assess how journalists report on climate change and how they deal with its denial, it is 53 \nfirst necessary to describe  what we call the  climate change frame  or IPCC  view , as well as  the 54 \ncontrarian voices in public debates. The climate change frame  or consensus  as presented in IPCC 55 \nreports  and in scientific journals  may be summarized in  four statements (Br\u00fcggemann and Engesser, 56 \n2014; Shehata and Hopmann, 2012) : (1) Global warming represents  an extraordinary rise in average 57 \nglobal temperatures since the industrial revolution. (2) It is mainly caused by human -induced  58 \nemissions of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases. (3) It creates problems for both ecosystems and 59 \nhumanity. (4) Emissions need to be reduced to avoid future damage.  These statements allow us to 60 \nidentify  four types of contrarianism  or challenges to the climate change frame ; they focus on  61 \ndoubting: the trend (climate change), the attribution (anthropogenic), the impact (risks, severe 62 \nproblems) , and the treatment (reducing emissions) (see Rahmstorf (2004) for the first three types of 63 \ncontrarianism). This framework does not capture  all variants of contrarian claims (Capstick and 64 \nPidgeon, 2014) ; it focuses on the challenges that attack the core of the consensus among the world\u2019s 65 \nleading climate scientists.  66 \n2 \n We call a ctors who challenge th e climate change frame in public debates \u2018 contrarians \u2019 rather 67 \nthan \u2018skeptics \u2019 or \u2018deniers ,\u2019 following a suggestion by McCright (2007) and O\u2019Neill  and Boykoff (2010). 68 \nThere are few climate scientists among the contrarians ; the group is comprised of  people from 69 \ndifferent backgrounds, many of whom  are closely connected to  professional lobbyists and  the \u2018denial 70 \nmachine\u2019  (Dunlap and McCright, 2011)  \u2013 i.e., their professional activities are part of a strategy to 71 \nprevent pro-active climate policy- making (Boussalis and Coan, 2016) . Contrarians as visible speakers 72 \nin public debates need to be distinguished from  both  individual citizens who may have doubts about 73 \nclimate change and from actors  who challenge more specific claims in the climate debate that are 74 \nnot part of the basic  consensus  outlined above . 75 \nThe journalistic practice s of (1) giving disproportionate voice to contrarians and  (2) 76 \nchallenging  the climate change consensus  will be the focus of our study . The two practices are 77 \ninterrelated but do not necessarily go together as the empirical analysis will show. First, w e will 78 \nbriefly sketch a conceptual framework  of important  factors that shape media content . Three levels of 79 \ninfluence can be distinguished: individual (journalist ), organizational (newsroom ), and external (e.g.  80 \nsocial institutions  and culture)  (cf. Shoemaker and Reese, 2014) . In different contexts, the  81 \n\u2018discretionary power \u2019 (Semetko et al., 1991)  of individual journalists  varies : They are provided with 82 \nmore or less leverage to set the frames of their coverage  (Br\u00fcggemann, 2014) . On all three levels of 83 \ninfluence, t wo main forces leave their imprint on media coverage:  ideological bias es and structural 84 \nmedia logics  (Schulz, 2011: 68) . Biases  are preferences or inclinations to treat a topic in a certain way 85 \n(Lee and Grimmer, 2008)  that stem from  individual journalist s, editors , external actors , and the wider 86 \ncultural context.  \u2018Media logic(s) \u2019 include  the professional norms and routin es of journali sts and 87 \nnewsrooms , which  Altheide (2004 , p. 294 ) defines as \u201cassumptions and processes for constructing 88 \nmessages within a particular medium. \u201d The most powerful media logics are news factors such as 89 \nnovelty, elite actors, or proximity : editors look for thes e attributes when deciding which stories to 90 \nrun, and journalists emphasize  them  in their coverage (Galtung and Ruge, 1965) . 91 \nPast studies have found evidence that  the power of bias and media logic s at different levels 92 \nof influence  explain s the role of contrarians in climate coverage . Depending on ideological bias , 93 \nclimate change is depicted as more or less uncertain , and climate policy is described as more or less 94 \ncostly, depending on the policies of the respective national government (Grundmann, 2007) . Below 95 \nthe national level that introduces this kind of political/cultural bias, newsroom policies  affect climate 96 \ncoverage ; right-leaning media are more likely to cite contrarian views  (Carvalho, 2007; Feldman et 97 \nal., 2015; Feldman et al., 2011) . There is also evidence that the  ideological stance of the individual 98 \nauthor  matters : right -wing columnists in the United States  cultivate hard -core denialism of climate 99 \nchange in their columns  (Elsasser and Dunlap, 2013) . Hence , different interpretations  of climate  100 \nchange,  which  are often strongly related to po litical ideology , influence the coverage of this issue . 101 \nExplanations drawing on media logics \u2013 particularly the professional norms of journalism \u2013  102 \nare strongly connected to the work of Boykoff and  Boykoff (2004)  who  emphasize the professional 103 \nnorm of balance  as an important influenc ing factor:  \"[...] journalists present competing points of 104 \nviews on a scientific question as though they had equal scientific weight, when actually they do not\u2019\u2019 105 \n(127). The norm of balance is part of the broader  concept of objectivity (Westerstahl, 1983) , which 106 \ncalls on journalists to provide a \u2018 neutral \u2019 account by giving equal voice to both sides in a conflict  107 \n(Hopmann et al., 2012) . Journalists follow this practice as it allows them to demonstrate their  108 \nprofessional  objectivity and to fend off accusations of one-sided coverage (Gans, 1979; Tuchman, 109 \n1972) . Balance also serves as a \"surrogate for validity checks\" (Dunwoody and Peters, 1992: 129)  if 110 \njournalists lack the time or expertise to assess the validity of conflicting statements from different 111 \nsources. Earlier research on environmental and science journalists in the United States  cited  evidence 112 \nof their  lack of knowledge about  what climate experts consider to be basic common i n climate 113 \n3 \n research (Wilson, 2000) . The norm of balance is particularly powerful in cases of contested 114 \nknowledge claims and a lack of expertise among the journalists who cover the respective issue. 115 \nFinally , conflicts create news value and thus stories that grasp audience attention. The presence of 116 \ncontrarians in media coverage may therefore be explained by either bias (ideological fit ) as outlined 117 \nabove or as part of journalistic norms (objectivity/balance) and routines (news values). Yet a pplying 118 \nthe norm of balance amplifies  the views of contrarians  (which may attract audience attention) and 119 \ndistorts  coverage of the issue. By quoting contrarian voices out of  context, journalists give them  120 \nlegitimacy and \u2018 media standing\u2019  that might also translate into political power (Gamson and Wolfsfeld, 121 \n1993) .  122 \nBoykoff and Boykoff (2004)  examined  the coverage of climate change in US newspapers from 123 \n1988 to 2002, and  found that half of the  article s presented a balanced account  of the issue;  slightly 124 \nmore than half of the television newscasts  analyzed  during that time  did so (Boykoff, 2008) . A 125 \nreplication  of the study  found the share of balanced coverage reduced from more than a third of all 126 \narticles in 2003 to about three percent in 2006 in US newspap ers (Boykoff,  2007) . Thus, b alanced 127 \nreporting may be retreating, but contrarians have not necessarily vanished from the media . Painter 128 \nand Gavin (2016) find that the British press quoted  contrarians in every fifth article during the years 129 \n2007 to 2011. Schmid -Petri et al.  (2015) find  that almost a third of articles in the US press contain  130 \ncontrarian  voices . Have journalists  therefore  moved on to a one -sided promotion of  denial of climate 131 \nchange, which would be proof of ideological bias, rather than  adher e to professional logics  such as 132 \nthe norm of balanced  coverage ? 133 \nA recent survey of  journalists covering climate change  in different countries fou nd that most  134 \nof them  strong ly agree d with the climate change consensus  (Br\u00fcggemann and Engesser, 2014) . 135 \nTherefore,  it seems that they  quote contrarians despite being aware that their claims defy the 136 \nfindings of climate scien ce. A much earlier US study  identified a journalistic tendency to amplify 137 \noutlier views and give  \u2018mavericks \u2019 a forum: Dearing (1995) ana lyzed US newspaper coverage of three 138 \nmaverick science stories (e.g. , propagating an alternative theory on the cause of AIDS). Our study 139 \nfollows his  model of analyz ing the content of coverage and then conduct ing a survey of  the authors 140 \nof the articles. Dearing  found that the surveyed journalists were aware that the \u2018 maverick scientists \u2019 141 \ndid not represent credible science , yet the  articles\u2019  neutral coverage of their views  gave the 142 \nmavericks credibility . Dearing explained this with news values such as conf lict that attract larger 143 \naudiences as well as  a general sympathy for maverick s in US public culture,  which  values 144 \nindividualism expressed through outlier views (also see Gans (1979)).  145 \nAnother trend in journalism should be considered for making sense of the finding that 146 \nbalanced coverage may be gone, but not so, the quoting of contrarian voices. Studies find a  trend 147 \ntowards interpretive reporting among  online science journalists  (Fahy and Nisbet, 2011)  and in  148 \npolitical journalism in different Western countries (Esser and Umbricht, 2014) . Hiles and Hinnant 149 \n(2014) found a radically redefined understanding of objectivity  among experienced climate 150 \njournalists  that goes beyond \u2018balanced coverage .\u2019 They found that  while these specialist journalists 151 \nstill attempted to refrain from letting their biases influence their coverage, they followed \u201cweight -of- 152 \nevidence  reporting \u201d (Dunwoody, 2005)  in which  storie s reflect scientific consensus and are \u201cwritten 153 \nwith authority\u201d ( Hiles and Hinnant, 2014 : 15) , thereby  distinguishing between  views that represent 154 \nvalid, peer -reviewed science and those that  represent outliers with no backing from  scientific 155 \nevidence or peers  (Boykoff, 2011) . Another qualitative interview study with science journalists in the 156 \nUnited States  confirms this trend: j ournalists  claim that they want to go \u201cbeyond balance\u201d and even 157 \nignor e contrarian voices (Gibson et al., 2016) . 158 \n4 \n Yet, whether these approaches are put into practice has not been comprehensively 159 \ninvestigated with regards to different media types in different cultural contexts. Most studies focus 160 \non the  US and British context s or on the coverage of  upmarket newspapers (Sch\u00e4fer and Schlichting, 161 \n2014) . Grundmann and Scott (2014)  also include  France and Germany  from 2000 to 2010 and a great 162 \nnumb er of newspapers using corpus linguistic methods . Their  study shows  that, overall, contrarians 163 \nare much less prominent in media discourses than speakers who support the climate change 164 \nconsensus . They also show  that countrie s consistently diverge on the salience of contrarians , with a 165 \nmuch stronger entrenchment of contrarian voices in the United States . This is in line with findings 166 \nfrom Painter and Ash e (2012) , who also included quality papers from Brazil, China , France , and India  167 \nin their analysis . They compared the coverage in 2007 and 2009/2010 during the UN Climate summit 168 \nin Copenhage n and , at the same time,  \u2018Climategate\u2019 ( the pseudo  scandal constructed around 169 \npersonal e-mails between climate researchers that were  published by contrarian bloggers  in order to 170 \ndiscredit climate research, Holliman (2011) ). Overall, these findings show  that there is no linear 171 \ndecline in contrarianism in the news , but rather that specific events (or staged pseudo  events like 172 \nClimategate) provide \u2018media opportunity structures \u2019 (Adam et al., 2003)  for contrarian s to become 173 \nsalient voices in media coverage . This explains why Shehata and Hopmann (2012) , who  focused on 174 \nmedia coverage between 1997 and 2007 , did not find contrarian s in the news . They studied  UN 175 \nclimate conferences , where contrarians have not managed to play a significant political role. This was 176 \nradically different i n the context of the C limatega te campaign : the content analysis of Painter and 177 \nAshe (2012)  found  that contrarian views occur red in every third article in the United States , followed 178 \nby the United Kingdom,  while contrarians played only a negligible role in all other countries.  179 \nPainter and Ashe also found that roughly the  same  number of articles rais ed doub ts about 180 \nclimate change in right -leaning and left -leaning  papers . The only difference was  that right -leaning 181 \npapers host ed contrarianism in their commentary pages , while these sources were  quoted in the left - 182 \nleaning newspapers. This confirms the influence of editorial bias on climate coverage : in right -leaning 183 \npapers, it is part of the editorial opinion; in left -leaning papers, contrarianism is raised by external 184 \nvoices.  Thus, past research has identified th e salience of contrarianism and the evaluation of 185 \ncontrarians as an important case for studying the influence of both ideological biases (along the left - 186 \nright spectrum)  and journalistic norms ( e.g., balance, news values).  While the studies mentioned 187 \nabove have  pushed the research in this area ahead, there are three main gaps  in the literature . 188 \nThe first concerns the role of contrarianism in post -Climategate  coverage , after 2010. 189 \nClimategate was an extraordinary moment of success of political spin, but it remains to be seen 190 \nwhether climate change denial retained a voice in transnational jour nalism  afterwards . Grundmann 191 \nand Stock (2014)  extended their analysis to 2010 and show that after the peak of attention to 192 \ncontrarians, the levels declined , but remained somewhat higher than during earlier times. In Britain, 193 \nthe level of contrarianism in media coverage remain ed high in 2011 (Painter and Gavin, 2016) . 194 \nSecond, Painter and Ashe\u2019s finding that contrarians were equally prominent in  right - and left- 195 \nleaning  papers raises the question  whether  (and how ) these quotes were evaluated in  the coverage . 196 \nFor example,  it is not clear whether contrarians were mentioned in the context of how they  continue 197 \nto make  unsubstantiated claims with no backing in climate science,  whether they  were balanced with 198 \nother voice s (as originally posited in the Boykoff  and Boykoff  study from 2004),  or whether 199 \nunbalanced contrarianism is occurring (as Painter and Gavin (2016) show for parts of the right - 200 \nleaning  press  in Britain ). In this regard, the study by Grundmann and Stock (201 2) provides a first 201 \nhint, as the term Climategate in their co -location analysis linked with the terms \u2018 stolen\u2019  and \u2018hacked \u2019 202 \nin the US media, while the British media preferred \u2018 leaked, \u2019 which  indicat es that journalists in 203 \ndifferent countries framed Climategate quite differently. This shows that analysis of the frequenc y of 204 \n5 \n reporting  contrarian  viewpoints  needs to also include whether and how they were evaluated in the 205 \narticle s. 206 \nThird, it is unclear  whether the quoting of  contrarian s is motivated by media logic through 207 \nadherence to journalistic norms (such as balance or news values) or by ideological biases (such as 208 \ngenuine questioning of  the validity of climate science ). This can best be explored by connecting 209 \ncontent ana lysis data with survey data (following the model introduced in  Dearing (1995)).  210 \nThis leads us to posit t hree  research questions : 211 \n1. To what degree is the climate change  frame  challenged in international media coverage  by 212 \nexpressing contrarian viewpoints ? 213 \n2. How do journalists treat  contrarian s as voices  in journalistic coverage  (quotes and evaluations) ? 214 \n3. How can (a) different degr ees of challenging the climate change consensus  and (b) ways of dealing 215 \nwith contrarians in journalistic coverage be explained ?  216 \n3. Methods  217 \nThis study pursue s a comprehensive  approach to analy zing climate -related content in the leading 218 \nnews media. It uses  a comparative design that varies the contexts \u2019 content production and survey s 219 \nthe authors of th e articles  analy zed. The study  include s all types of content  (straight news reporting 220 \nas well as  other  types of articles) , look s at all kinds of contributors of news content  (specialized 221 \nscience reporters  as well as  other  authors ), and examines  articles  published in both online and paper 222 \nformat s.   223 \n3.1 Case selection and sampling  224 \nDue to the global scope of climate c hange and our interest in trans national patterns  of climate 225 \ncoverage , we included journalists and their news stories from Germany, India, Switzerland, the 226 \nUnited Kingdom , and the United States  in our study. All five countries have  high amounts of CO 2 227 \nemissions (either total or per capita ), and are thus likely to feature vivid debates on climate change. 228 \nClimate change reporting in t he industrialized countries features vary ing degrees  of contrarianism : it 229 \nis relatively high in the United States , medium in the United Kingdom , and low in Germany , 230 \nSwitzerland,  and India  (Grundmann and Scott, 2014; Painter and Ashe, 2012) . India  is included as an 231 \nexemplary emerging economy  that debates climate change not in terms of contrarians vs. climate 232 \nscience but as a conflict between traditional CO 2 emitters and the emerging economies (Billett, 2010; 233 \nPainter, 2011) . We selected leading news outlets from different sectors of the media landscape in 234 \neach country : two upmarket newspapers ( preferably one right  leaning and one left leaning ), one 235 \nmass-market or mid -market newspaper, one regional newspaper from a complementary 236 \nmetropolitan area, and one major online news outlet  (Online Appendix Table A1 further expla ins the 237 \ncase selection). Our selection of news outlets was inspired by previous studies  (Boykoff et al., 2016; 238 \nSchmidt et al., 2013) . Both print and online editions  were included.  239 \nIn order to match authors and their articles, the sampling started by identifying the authors 240 \nof articles on climate change , including specialized journalists  and those who occasionally wrote 241 \nabout the top ic. Furthermore, the study focused  not only  on coverage centered around certain key 242 \nevents like Copenhagen  and \u2018Climate Gate\u2019 , but start ed later and spanned  the time of routine 243 \ncoverage after these events (1 January 2011 \u2013  31 December  2012).  We used Google and the search 244 \nstring \u2018climate change\u2019  OR \u2018global warming\u2019  OR \u2018greenhouse effect \u2019 (and the equi valent s in German) . 245 \nThese  search strings have been validated in previous studies (e.g. Schmidt et al., 2013) . We 246 \n6 \n complemented the w eb search by including the print versions of the respective news outlets drawn 247 \nfrom databases  (LexisNexis and Factiva ). 248 \nFrom this sample, we manually selected all articles that focus ed on climate change and 249 \ndisclos ed author names  or abbreviations . From the resulting list of names , we excluded all people 250 \nwho published less than two pertinent articles in order to eliminate th ose who  only coincidentally 251 \nmentioned climate change  in one article . We tested the reliability of this  author search procedure on 252 \na sub -sample consisting of the articles from one news outlet. Two student coders achieved a 253 \nsatisfactory agreement of 89%.  The search generated a survey population of 170 climate journalists, 254 \nwho we invited by e- mail to participate in our bilingual (English and German) online survey (27 255 \nSeptember \u2013 10 October 2012). After several reminders by e -mail and phone, a  sample of 62 256 \njournalists  completed the questionnaire. Th e response rate of  36% can be considered satisfactory for 257 \na cross-national o nline survey of  journalists. We match ed the survey respondents with their articles 258 \n(maximum of 30  articles per journalist ), which  result ed in a core sample  of 747 articles.  259 \nFrom some outlets,  no (or very few)  journalists responded to the survey. For those news 260 \norganizations , the sample was extended so that at least 30 articles from each outlet  could be 261 \nincluded in the analysis.  In this way, a n extended  sample  of 936 art icles was  generated that reflect ed 262 \nthe diversity of the journalistic output in 25 different news outlets in five countries.  This sample will 263 \nbe used to describe and compare patterns of news content. The  explanatory part connecting 264 \ninterviews and survey responses will have to be restricted to the core sample of the articles of 265 \njournalists who had responded (N  = 747) in the survey . In order to test whether there is a bias in the 266 \ncore  sample, we compared the percentages for the key variable IPCC  index  that indicates a 267 \njournalist \u2019s agreement with the climate change consensus  and found no statistically significant 268 \ndifference  between the smaller and the extended samples  (index va lue of M  = 0.62 in the core 269 \nsample,  compared to M  = 0.57 in the extended  sample).  270 \nThe extended sample of the content analysis (N  = 936) covered  the years 2011 and 2012,  271 \nwhich represent s a period of modest and routine coverage of climate change. This time frame  272 \nfeatured two UN climate summits, COP  (Confere nce of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention 273 \non Climate Change)  17 and COP 18, two special IPCC reports, a couple of extreme weather events, 274 \nsuch as a hot summer in the United States  in 2011 and a hot spring in Europe in 2011, as well as 275 \nhurricanes Ir ene and Katia. While the COPs received a substantial amount of coverage in our sample 276 \n(18%), the special IPCC reports were largely ignored (1%), and weather events comprised  6% of the 277 \ncoverage. Among the most important news pegs were the publication of sci entific studies  (32%) and 278 \nthe actions of domestic governments (16%).  279 \n3.2 Measures and coding  280 \nThe IPCC view : The survey  measures challenges to the climate change consensus  by asking 281 \njourna lists about the scientific validity of the following statements ( on a scale from 1 = \u201cscientifically 282 \nuntenable\u201d  to 5 = \u201cscientifically well  founded \u201d): 283 \n1. Global warming: The average global temperature has been rising for about 150 years. 284 \n2. Anthropogenity: Global warming has been largely caused by humans through CO 2 285 \nemissions and other greenhouse gases.  286 \n3. Risks : The impact of global warming will most likely create major problems for our global 287 \necosystem.  288 \n4. Emission reduction: Humankind must strongly reduce CO 2 emissions in order to limit 289 \nfuture global warming.  290 \n7 \n In the content analysis, we coded w hether any of these statements was explicitly 291 \n\u2018challenged\u2019  (= -1), \u2018balanced/ not mentioned \u2019 (= 0), or \u2018 mentioned/ supported\u2019  (= 1). Mentioning 292 \n\u2018global warming\u2019  without any challenges or further qualification was coded as suppo rt for the claim 293 \nthat the earth is warming.  However, \u2018balanced\u2019  was almost never coded, as less than a handful of 294 \narticles openly  debated these statements. The four items were averaged in to a formative index ( IPCC 295 \nindex ). 296 \nJournalistic treatment of contrarians : Journalists may ignore, mention , quote,  or evaluate  297 \ncontrarian voices in their coverage. Evaluative c ontextualization  could , for example,  call into question 298 \nor affirm the scientific expertise and authority of contrarians.  These different journ alistic treatments 299 \nof contrarians were measured in both the survey and content analysis. The survey asked whether 300 \nvoices that challenge the four statements  from the IPCC view  should be ignored  or given equal voice 301 \nwith  other actors  in the climate debate. The content analysis coded whether contrarian voices 302 \n(\u2018skeptics\u2019) were mentioned  and/or  quoted , and whether they were contextualized positive ly, 303 \nnegatively,  or in a \u2018 balanced \u2019 way.  304 \nThe coding was conducted by a team of six coders. T he reliability test was based on a 305 \nrandomized sample of 57 articles  using the standardized Lotus reliability coefficient , which is 306 \nadjusted by chance (for a discussion of the merits of this measure as compared to other coefficients, 307 \nsee Fretwurst, 2015) . After a  first reliability test failed to generate satisfactory results, the cod ebook 308 \nwas further simplified and elaborated,  and the coders were trained for three additional weeks. The 309 \nsecond test (with new articles) provided satisfactory results  (see Online  Appendix Table A2).  310 \n4. Findings  311 \n4.1 Challenges to the anthropogenic climate change frame  312 \nThe IPCC view (climate change consensus ) is widely shared across countries and different kinds of 313 \nmedia outlets. Figure 1 shows that the four statements that constitute  our operationalization of the 314 \nIPCC view  are rarely challenged : in only 2\u20134% of the articles. Yet, often  they are not explicitly 315 \nmentioned \u2013 except for the process of warming , which is already indicated in the term \u2018 global 316 \nwarming. \u2019 The strongly overlapping confidence intervals in Figure 1 indicate that there is no 317 \nsignificant difference between the degrees to which the different  statements are challenged , and 318 \nhence between the different kinds of contrarianism . Transnational climate coverage clear ly conveys 319 \nthe climate change consensus . Climate change denial occurs  only in niches that  will be explored 320 \nbelow  in more detail.  321 \n[Insert Figure 1 here].  322 \n4.2 Contextualization of c ontrarians  323 \nThe paradox of climate coverage is that although climate change denial has almost vanished from the 324 \ncoverage  of most leading news outlets , contrarian s are still being mentioned or quoted in almost 325 \nevery fifth article  (see Figure 2 ) \u2013 which is significantly more often than the IP CC is quoted . Yet, t he 326 \ncontextualization of contrarians and the IPCC differs: while the IPCC is mentioned or quoted in a 327 \nneutral tone ( 57 percent of articles in which it is mentioned or quoted, see Figure 3), more than 69%  328 \nof the articles that mention or quote contrarians also contextualize them in a negative way .  329 \n[Insert Figure 2 and 3 here].  330 \nThe negative evaluation of contrarians co -occurs with quot ing them: Three-fourths of the 331 \narticles that contained a negative evaluation of contrarians also quoted them  (see Figure 4 ). Yet 332 \nalmost three -fourths of the very few articles  (N = 11) that positive ly depicted the contrarians did not 333 \n8 \n include a quotation. This means that journalist s do not necessarily quote contrarian s to legitimize 334 \nthem or provide them with a  public platform; they often do so to debunk  contrarians.  This strategy 335 \nmay be called dismissive quotation.  Journalists who support the contrarians tend to refrain from 336 \nquoting them . We suggest to label this  practice protective omission . To provide an illustrative 337 \nexample of a dismissive quotation, we might cite a Guardian Blog post (from May  2, 2012) that 338 \nprovides a direct quote from a contrarian after explaining that 600 MP s had voted for a climate- 339 \nrelated bill, against three opponents: \u201cConservative MP Peter Lilley, one of the lonely trio who voted 340 \nagainst the climate change act, told the audience: \u2018I am the token denialist, a suitable case for 341 \ntreatment for deviating from the Stalinist line.\u2019\u201d Further down, the article explains: \u201cThe sc eptics are 342 \na fringe within a fringe. Another sceptic, Stuart Wheeler, stood up to say there had been no warming 343 \nfor 15 years (yawn) and that the costs of climate action were too high and then walked out, 344 \nuninterested in further debate.\u201d1 345 \n[Insert Figure 4  here].  346 \nThese broader transnational patterns may cloud important differences  among climate 347 \njournalists that can be explained by  national , organizational (media outlet) , or individual (climate 348 \ncontrarian  attitude) contexts . Identifying content differences  that run along context ual differences  349 \nhelps us identify the circumstances under which the IPCC view is challenged and contrarians are  350 \nquoted. 351 \n4.3 National bias  352 \nThe analysis  reveal s that the British media outlets are significantly more contrarian than those from  353 \nall other countries  in the sample (Figure s 5 and 6). Probably in the context of the debate about the 354 \n\u2018hiatus ,\u2019 even the most basic statement (that it is indeed getting warmer ) is contested in 16% of all 355 \nBritish articles in the sample.  Coverage in the leading news outlets selected for our analysis does not 356 \nsimply mirror the degree of public contrarianism  as measured in surveys for the respective countries: 357 \nthe US media in our sample are not significantly more contrarian  than media outlets from India, 358 \nSwitzerland,  and Germany. As expected  based on the findings from other studies (Billett, 2010; 359 \nPainter, 2011) , the India n media stand out due to  a total lack of challenge of  the four IPCC 360 \nstatements. The question of whether anthropogenic climate change is  a serious risk seems to be 361 \nuncontested in India. In our data, this results in low values on challenges, as well as a comparatively 362 \nlow IPCC index  value , as there is also a lack of explicit support for the four IPCC consensus statements  363 \nas well.  364 \n[Insert Figure 5 and 6 here].  365 \nOf the countries studied, t he British and US media most  heav ily quot e contrarian voices (in 366 \n25% of the British and 17% of the US articles) , and these are  clearly negative ly evaluat ed. The 367 \nstandard deviation  of the IPCC index values  is considerably higher for the data from Brita in than for 368 \nthe other countries , which indicat es a polarized debate w ith different kinds of coverage by different 369 \nnews outlets and journalists.  370 \n4.4 Organizational bias  371 \nThese  findings  about country differences need to be refined by looking at the level of media outlets 372 \nand even individual journalists: a  single columnist for the Daily Telegraph (Christopher Booker) wrote  373 \n48% of the  77 UK article s that challenged the basic assumptions of anthropogenic climate change. 374 \n1 URL: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian- carrington -blog/2012/may/02/climate -\nchange -sceptic -right -wing  (last accessed: 17.11.2016)  \n9 \n                                                             Other individuals in our sample consistently doubt aspects of the climate change consensus , such as  375 \nthe Danish economist Bj \u00f8rn Lomborg and the former German politician Fritz Vahrenholt. They were 376 \nallowed to raise their doubts in guest contributions to  the Wall  Street Journal  and the German 377 \ntabloid BILD Zeitung, respectively . Yet, in contrast to Booker, they are not regular columnists of these 378 \noutlets . Apart from the Daily Telegraph, the Wall Street Journal , and the BILD Zeitung, only the SUN  379 \nand the Berner Zeitung  feature more than 10% of climate -related articles that challeng e the climate 380 \nchange consensus . It should also be mentioned that almost all of the popu lar and regional 381 \nnewspapers have  only very scarce coverage of climate change: a total of about a dozen articles 382 \npublished over the course of roughly 18 months . Organizational factors thus not only impact bias but , 383 \nperhaps most importantly , the degree of at tention that is paid to climate change.  384 \nAlmost all of the outlets with a substantial share of contrarianism  (e.g. , Daily Telegraph,  Wall 385 \nStreet Journal ) have  a right -leaning editorial policy. In order to further substantiate this finding, we 386 \nexplicitly com pared left -leaning and right -leaning upmarket newspapers ( Figures  7 and 8). The 387 \nanalysis confirms the pattern found above: r ight-leaning papers challenge climate change 388 \nsignificantly more often, but left -leaning papers quote contrarians more often , and cl early evaluate 389 \nthem negatively.  390 \n[Insert Figure 7 and 8 here].  391 \n4.5 Individual bias  392 \nFinally, the case of Christopher Booker illustrates the influence of individual authors and their 393 \nsubjective interpretations of climate change. Br\u00fcggemann  and Engesser (2014)  have shown that 394 \nthere is a core of what they call \u2018 prolific writers \u2019 that contribute s two-thirds of the climate coverage  395 \nacross different kinds of outlets , while the rest of the coverage is produced by a multitude of 396 \njournalists who all write only occasionally on this topic. Other studies have also shown that expert 397 \nscience writers have a particularly high degree of individual editorial freedom (Dunwoody, 1 980) . In 398 \nthe case of Booker from the Daily Telegraph, he does not enjoy particular freedom due to his 399 \nexpertise on the science beat , but instead as a well- known columnist who caters to a valuable 400 \naudience of like -minded  right -leaning readers.  In order to t est whether  journalists \u2019 personal  401 \npreferences translate into individual patterns of writing about climate change, we correlated the ir 402 \ninterpretations (as articulated in the survey ) with the aggregate bias of their articles. Table 1  shows 403 \nthat this is clearly the case : there are  strong and statistically significant correlations between the IPCC 404 \nindex  as drawn from the survey for each journalist and the index drawn from their writing. The 405 \nsurvey statement \u201cclimate skeptics are important voices in the deb ate\u201d  also translates into a greater 406 \ntendency to positive ly evaluat e contrarian speakers.  407 \n[Insert Table 1 here].  408 \nIt is interesting to note that statements abou t whether contrarians should be excluded or 409 \nhave  equal voice do not translate in to more or less quoting of contrarians. Journalists who agree with 410 \nthe statement that contrarians should not be given the chance to voice their opinions seem even 411 \nmore inclined to quote them, while journalists who demand equal voice for contrarians do not quote 412 \nthem more often. While neither  correlation is statistically significant, they  are still hig hly plausible in 413 \nlight of the journalistic practice s identified above:  journalists with a negative attitude towards 414 \nclimate contrarians quote them in their art icles, but only  in order to dismiss the m (dismissive 415 \nquotation) , while journalists who think favorably of climate contrarians support their arguments but 416 \navoid quot ing them  (protective omission) .  417 \n5. Discussion  418 \n10 \n These findings produce  a nuanced picture of how journalistic norms and biases interact in producing 419 \nclimate coverage. Our findings  advan ce the state of research in four  ways.   420 \nFirst, the analysis shows that the  interpretive community of climate journalists in different 421 \ncountries found in a prior survey of journalists  (Br\u00fcggemann and Engesser, 2014)  clearly also shapes 422 \nthe coverage across different news outlets and national contexts. The climate change consensus  is 423 \nthe established master frame in the climate debate  as represented in leading media outlets in 424 \ndifferent countries . \u2018Climategate\u2019 and the failure to reach a global climate agreement  in Copenhagen 425 \nhave  not led to climate coverage that continuously doubts the existence of a nthropogenic climate 426 \nchange, or  the risks associated wi th it and the need to  reduce emissions. Rather , the failure of 427 \nCopenhagen \u2013 combined, probably, with the effects of cuts in the number  of science journalists \u2013  has 428 \nled to reduced coverage after 2010, as the continuous monitoring of climate coverage shows  429 \n(Boykoff et al., 2016) . Our study has focused on this period of routine, low -profile coverage of 430 \nclimate change,  mostly provided by expert climate, science or environment writers . The coverage 431 \nclearly illustrates  the scientific consensus surrounding the basic understanding of c limate change.  432 \nThis is also likely to reflect a learning process among climate journalists after (at the time of the data 433 \ncollection in 2011 and 2012) 15 UN climate summits and four rounds of IPCC reports.  In contrast to 434 \nearlier studies (Wilson, 2000) , most journalists are aware of the broad consensus about the basics of 435 \nclimate change as represented in our operationalization of the climate change consensus .  436 \nSecond, this study refines our understanding of how contrarians get into the news  despite 437 \nthis consensus that is shared by both journalists and scientists. Our findings indicate that t he norm of 438 \nbalance can no longer be regarded as the prime explanation of  the salience of contrarians in media 439 \ncoverage.  We find that  contrarian s are still, co nsidering their fringe position in scientific discourse, 440 \noverrepresented in media coverage , particularly in the United States  and Britain .  Yet, this is not a 441 \nsign of adherence to the norm of balance. Balanced coverage of a \u2018he said/she said\u2019 style ha s been 442 \nreplaced by an active contextuali zation and evaluation of contrarian voices, e.g. , by pointing out their 443 \nlack of expertise in climate science . Quot es of  contrarians are paired with a dismissal of their stance 444 \non climate change. This explains why recent  studies (e.g. Painter and Ashe, 2012)  have found equal 445 \nlevels of salience of contrarians mentioned in left- and right -leaning papers. We confirm this finding 446 \nand expand on  its explanation: journalists who are themselves contrarian  do not quote contr arians as 447 \n\u2018opportune witnesses \u2019 (Hagen, 1993)  in order to hide their own opinions . Past theorizing would also 448 \nassume that journalists  legitimize certain actors  by quoting them (Gamson and Wolfsfeld, 1993) . 449 \nWith regards to contrarians, we instead  find dismissive quotes  and protective omissions  \u2013 two 450 \nvariants of the repository of journalistic practices that have been neglected in  past theorizing.   451 \nComparing our findings to the earlier studies by Boykoff and others leads us to posit  a shift  in 452 \njournalist ic norms from \u2018objective /balanced\u2019 journalism towards interpretive journalism. Evidence of 453 \nthis trend has also been provided for  political reporting  in different Western countries (Esser and 454 \nUmbricht, 2014) . Br\u00fcggemann and Engesser\u2019s (2014) survey also found that 70%  of climate 455 \njournalists said they did not want to ignore contrarian voices but to critically contextualize them.  By 456 \nconnecting survey and content analysis, o ur study shows  that these intentions articulated in surveys 457 \nand interviews are put into practice.   458 \nThe negative contextualizati on of contrarians , particularly in outlets like the Huffington Post 459 \nand the Guardian,  takes the form of a news  narrative about climate cha nge deniers who are part of a  460 \nprofessionally organized lobbying effort ( \u2018denial  machine\u2019  (Dunlap and MacCright, 2010) ) that is 461 \nultimately directed against any restrictive regulations or laws to fight climate change .  This narrative 462 \ncan be seen as a product  of interpretive journalism , but it can also be explained by  news value  463 \ntheory : the story provides conflict  and negativity,  and there by attracts attention. Media logics such 464 \n11 \n as the rise of  interpretive journalism and the continuing adherence to news values thus converge to 465 \nexplain the enduring salience of contrarians in coverage by journalists who are fully aware of the 466 \nbasic scientific agreement concerning anthropogenic climate change.  467 \nThird , niches of denial persist. B y comparing the national, organizational , and individua l 468 \nlevels, we can s how in which contexts the continuous  denial of anthropogenic climate change is 469 \ninstitutionalized. It is not  only  a certain national -political context  that matters ; otherwise, we would  470 \nhave found more contrarian ism in the leading US print and online news outlets . Nor is it  only  the 471 \neditorial line of right -leaning news outlets ; otherwise there would be more denial in right -leaning 472 \npapers like the German FAZ. It is also not only  the contrarian  attitude of a small number of 473 \njournalists. Our st udy finds evidence of the explanatory power of all three levels, but they only 474 \nbecome fully effective  when combine d in a certain way to provide the necessary and sufficient 475 \nconditions for publishing denial:  contrarian  authors , in a right -leaning medium, in a country with elite 476 \nvoices , and lobbyists  who back  the denial of climate change. This constellation of conditions  is an 477 \nimportant explanation of the unique volume of contrarianism published in the British Daily Telegraph  478 \nby a single columnist. We show that a single journalist can make a difference, if he or she works in a 479 \ncertain editorial and national context providing the discursive opportunity for denial.  This case  also 480 \nillustrat es how ideological bias at  different levels of  influence shapes the news: a  writer with 481 \npersonal doubts about climate change, in a newsroom with a certain ideological leaning,  and a wider 482 \ndiscourse culture in which denial of climate change is part of the repertoire. It is also interesting that 483 \nthe new s outlets from India in the sample contained  no challenges  to the IPCC view ; the debate there 484 \nseems to focus on completely different issues , which  deserve s further analysis.  485 \nFinally, there is a specific pattern of polariz ed debate in the Anglo -Saxon countries that  is, in 486 \nour sample, most clearly shown in the British media outlets  analy zed. One British media outlet ( the 487 \nDaily Telegraph, led by a single columnist ) seem s to be the stronghold of climate denial. However, 488 \nanother British media outlet, the Guardian, features frequent dismissive quoting of  contrarians.  The 489 \nBBC does not challenge the IPCC view, and rarely quotes contrarian voices. Thus the private media in 490 \nBritain engage in a n ever more polarized debate , while the public news outlet tries to defend its 491 \nneutrality by abstaining from this part of the debate. 492 \n6. Conclusion  493 \nOur study has contributed to both climate communication and journalism studies as the first to 494 \ncombine a survey of climate journalists from different me dia and national backgrounds with an 495 \nanalysis of their articles.  Its descriptive section  has shown that a transnational interpretive 496 \ncommunity among climate journalists along the lines of climate change consensus  translates into 497 \nmedia coverage, but that  journalists still give substantial media attention to contrarian s. We explain 498 \nthis paradox using a model of interacting media logics and biases at the individual author, news 499 \noutlet , and countr y levels . We have found that j ournalistic practices as part of media logic are 500 \nevolving from objective/balanced towards more interpretive journalism. T he power of n ews values 501 \nsuch  as conflict to shape climate coverage  remains the same . 502 \nThe implications of the  resulting  patterns of media coverage with  regards to contributing to a 503 \ndemocratic public sphere  \u2013 and thus a constructive debate on climate change \u2013 are unclear . 504 \nDemocratic theory calls for a  journalistic watchdog,  and complex issues like climate change call for 505 \nmore contextualization than is provided in the traditional model of objective, balanced journalism. 506 \nInterpretive journalism may thus be welcomed  from this normative perspective, because it  provid es 507 \na better base for creating  public understanding of complex issues like climate change and cl imate 508 \npolitics.  It can be viewed as part of the professional duty of journalists to  provide \u201cweight -of- 509 \nevidence reporting\u201d (Dunwoody, 2005)  and therefore contextualize contrarian voices.  The good news 510 \n12 \n arising from this study is that contextualized reportin g is moving closer to what is widely understood 511 \nas a consensus around the basics of climate change:  journalism can be blamed less for confusing the 512 \npublic. 513 \nYet, the fixation on the clash between contrarians and climate science  may crowd out more 514 \nrelevant debates related to climate change policy -making and climate science. This narrative may  515 \nentertain partisan audiences on both sides of the political spectrum , but it also polarize s the debate . 516 \nA more constructive turn would be to ignore the contrarians and look for new narratives: for 517 \nexample,  journalists could hold politicians accountable to their public pledges given at the recent 518 \nclimate summit (COP -21) in Paris  by investigati ng the national implementation of promises to reduce 519 \nCO 2 emissions . It is a challenge for journalists  to search for new ways to frame climate change , and a 520 \nchallenge  for researchers to detect these new emerging  narrative s in order to provide a more 521 \nnuanced analysis  of cli mate debates . Both journalists and media scholars  need to look  for new 522 \ndimensions in the debate. One  step in this direction is the framework offered by Corry and 523 \nJorgensen , who  map the climate policy debate by taking into account the perception of the climate 524 \nproblem as more or less \u201c wicked\u201d  and the preferred solutions that can rely on a more individualist or 525 \nholistic framework (Corry and J\u00f8rgensen, 2015) .  526 \nFurther i mplications for future  research stem from both  the findings and the limits of our  527 \nstudy. Content analyses need to go beyond counting who gets a voice to focus on how (e.g.,  528 \ncontrarian ) voices are contextualized. Future content analysis also needs to go beyond coding 529 \npositive /negative evaluations as we  do: this may even be done through automated content analysis . 530 \nYet, the results need to be  complemented by deeper qualitative analyse s that identify how exactly 531 \ndifferent voices are contextualized.  Our findings also emphasize the importance of editorial policies , 532 \nand thus of studying more than one news outlet per country and making a more conscious choice of 533 \nwhich media outlets to study.  Even t hough our  study has gone beyond focusing on upmarket 534 \nnewspapers , it has still neglected outlets like Fox News (Feldman et al., 2011)  or US talk radio 535 \nstations , which are likely to host more denialism than those  included here . This is why the US media, 536 \nin our sample, seem s less contrarian  than British media. Our study may inspire future research that 537 \ncombin es content analyses with interviews of  the authors of the articles. Yet, the current study  also 538 \nreveals a limitation of this approach : journalists \u2019 willingness to participate in a survey . Finally, 539 \nanalytically, our results remind us that individual, organiza tional , and national influences on media 540 \ncontent should not be regarded as mutually exclusive. Also,  biases and professional logics  are not 541 \nalternative explanations for journalistic practices. The se different factors inte ract and complement 542 \neach other to explain the practices observed in climate journalism.   543 \n13 \n References  544 \nAdam S, Berkel B and Pfetsch B (2003) Media opportunity structures \u2013A brake block of the 545 \nEuropeanisation of public spheres.

We selected outlets that can be considered leaders in term s of prestige and audience reach in each market \nsegment. The regional newspapers selected are based in another metropolitan area than the upmarket papers selected. While they have a clear regional base, \nthey are not necessarily limited in geographic scope to this area. In the case of India, we were restricted to English -language news outlets. Outlets like the \nGuardian  and the New York Times  may also be regarded as global players, yet they are also influenced by the journalism culture of their country and reflect \nthe specifics of the national debate about climate change. The Times of India  is an upmarket newspaper but is also widely regarded as the country\u2019s leading \nonline news outlet. For audience reach, see Olmstead et al. (2011) and WAN (2010).  \nWe included one right -leaning and one left -leaning upmarket newspaper in every country. In India, only the Hindustan Times  could be clearly classified as \nleft leaning. We sampled the paper as regional because it comes from Southern Chennai. For the compara tive analysis of right - and left -leaning outlets, we \nused the upmarket newspapers in each country. For India we included the Hindu and the Hindustan Times . For the BBC and News.ch we did not assign \npolitical leanings in the table above as the BBC is legally bound to be impartial and balanced, and News.ch heavily relies on relatively impartial news agency \nmaterial. For the political leanings of the other outlets, see Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010), Painter (2013), and Schmidt and S ch\u00e4fer (2015).  Political  leanings \nwere furthermore assigned after consultation with country experts for the respective countries. \n27 \n  \nTable A 2: Reliability Test Results  \nCategory  Item  S-Lotus (adjusted by chance)  Pearson\u2019s r \nIPCC view  Warming  0.89   \nAnthropogenity  0.75   \nRisks  0.75   \nEmission reduction  0.80   \nIPCC view indexa  0.86  \nActor mentioningb IPCC  0.98   \nContrarians  0.89   \nActor evaluationc IPCC  0.97   \nContrarians  0.90   \nNote:  aAverage index of the four respective IPCC view items;  bScale: 0 = \"not mentioned,\" 1 = \n\"mentioned,\" 2 = \"quoted/several mentions,\" 3 = \"quoted at length\"; cScale: -1 = \"negative,\" \n0 = \"not mentioned\"/\"balanced,\" to 1 = \"positive\"  \n \nReferences  \nGentzkow, M. & Shapiro, J.
