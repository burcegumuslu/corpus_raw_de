Since July 2023, the institute has been exhibiting fascinating modern paintings in collaboration with the art center GLO'ART for young artists from\nNeerharen-Lanaken, Belgium.\nThis exhibition offers employees a new perspective on art and painting and is intended to inspire as well as on their own academic work. Just like science and research, art is the result of a creative process. Just like art, science and research are subject to constant change, discourse and practice. The free, creative spirits of both the arts and research have always complemented each other extremely well. The works on display give the staff a wonderful opportunity to spur on their imagination, thus providing them with new impetus for creative processes.\nAdvantageous framework and an inspiring atmosphere\nGLO'ART is a cultural organization that provides a platform for talented artists from around the world. It invites selected artists to Belgium to work creatively in local studios for a several weeks residency.\nSince 2013, more than 300 artists from 60 different countries have already found their way to the creative center. With its focus on supporting young artists, GLO'ART perfectly complements Fraunhofer\u2019s mission of promoting young scientists. Therefore, the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology ILT has entered into a two-year cooperation with GLO'ART in summer 2023 and will present 15 works of young artists from all over the world who have given free rein to their creativity in the Euregio every six months.", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": "website", "links": ["/en.html", "/en.html", "/en/press.html",
