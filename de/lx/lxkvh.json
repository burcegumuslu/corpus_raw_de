Daneben meine jahrelange \u201cLeidenschaft\u201d diverses aus der Literatur , insbesondere \nin den letzten  Jahren nat\u00fcrlich aus diesen Bereichen , in Englischer Sprache verschlingen zu wollen\nDiese beiden Tatsachen halfen enorm dabei \u201cmit zu helfen\u201d meinen langj\u00e4hrigen Beschwerden , die in das \nSpektrum Ersch\u00f6pfungszust\u00e4nde,M\u00fcdigkeiten ,Depression ,Ein  & Durchschlafst\u00f6rungen , diverse \nneuropathische Schmerzzust\u00e4nde einzukategorisieren sind , in Kooperation mit meiner Medizinerin auf den \nGrund zu gehen.\nBeschwerden , die im Volksmund und von \u201cunkundigen\u201d Medizinern gerne mal in die Ecke \u201cHypochondrie\u201d \nverschoben werden. Was allerdings gegen diese \u201cHypochondriehypothese\u201d sprach , war die Tatsache , dass \nsich diese Beschwerden zunehmend in jene Richtung manifestierten , DASS MAN MIR DIESE PROBLEME \nAUCH (OPTISCH) ANSSAH !  Das galt INSBESONDERE f\u00fcr die Zeit am Morgen (ersch\u00f6pfte ,m\u00fcde Augen \n& verkatert) ,  !  Und ,.. es kam gelegentlich schon mal vor , dass ich mir von Kollegen vorhalten musste : \u201c \nHey hast du die letzte Nacht in Schwabing durchgemacht ?  Zynismus kam in solchen F\u00e4llen von meiner \nSeite zur\u00fcck !  Nat\u00fcrlich sch\u00e4mte ich mich (insgeheim) daf\u00fcr und da dieses Ph\u00e4nomen \u00fcber die Jahre nicht \nverschwand , sondern die  Tendenz hatte eher immer schlimmer als besser zu werden, entschloss ich mich \ndiese Sache final anzugehen.\nHierzu fand ich auch eine wirklich sehr engagierte und aufgeschlossene Medizinerin.  Diagnostiziert & \nausprobiert wurde in dieser Zeit viel. Unter anderem wurde in dieser Zeit auch sehr viele Labormarker \nangefordert und es stellte sich an Hand der Ergebnisse vieler Labormarker heraus , dass es sich hier NICHT \num Hypochondrie handeln konnte , da  VIELE Labormarker ausserhalb ihrer zul\u00e4ssigen Referenzbereiche \nlagen. UND , man stellte eine HOCHGRADIGE Allergie gegen praktisch S\u00c4MTLICHE g\u00e4ngigen \nGetreidesorten , einschlie\u00dfllich Gluten Huhn und Haselnuss fest. Der Allergiescan damals ergab: F\u00dcR ALLE \nH\u00d6CHSTE STUFE , STUFE III..  Damit war klar , ich WAR KEIN HYPOCHONDER !!!\nDiverse Therapieversuche und Versuche mit diversen Therapiema\u00dfnahmen ,seien  es Medikamente , \nNahrungserg\u00e4nzungsmittel , Vitamin & N\u00e4hrstofftherapien ,Therapieverfahren etc.  brachten keinen \nDURCHSCHLAGENDEN UND/ODER DAUERHAFTEN Erfolg.\nBis schlie\u00dflich im Winter 2009/10 die Quecksilberfrage das erste mal gestellt wurde: Ich hatte noch 4 alte \nAmalgamplomben im Mund , die noch aus der Zeit <1987 stammten. Mein Gl\u00fcck hier \u2013 jetzt im nachhinein \u2013 \nwar , dass uns (mich) unser damaliger Chemielehrer (Dr. in Chemie)  in unserem Leistungskurs Chemie (2. \nBildungsweg)  in der Zeit etwa von 1886 \u2013 1989 dar\u00fcber aufkl\u00e4rte , dass es besser ist auf Amalgamplomben \nzu verzichten , da in diesem Plomben sehr viel Hg verarbeitet wird und dass Hg sehr giftig ist.\nDiese Aufkl\u00e4rungsarbeit dieses Chemielehreres ist es wohl auch zu verdanken ,dass ich heute noch lebe. \nSchlie\u00dflich lie\u00df mich diese Sache aufhorchen und ich verzichtete ab diesem Zeitpunkt auf \nAmalgamplomben. Ab der Zeit etwa >1987 wurden mir NUR noch Kunststoffplomben eingesetzt , wenn es \nmal was zu reparieren gab, WEIL ICH DARAUF BESTAND ! . Die 4 alten Amalgamplomben , belie\u00df ich \nallerdings in meinem Mund , da ich damals dachte: \u201cso schlimm wird's dann schon nicht werden' . GENAU \nDAS  stellte sich sp\u00e4ter als FATALER FEHLER heraus.\nIn der Zeit April/Mai 2010 wurde eine Stuhlprobe von mir im Labor Bremen auf seine Hg-Belastung hin \nuntersucht und das Ergebnis war sehr \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigend: Es wurden 70 \u00b5g Hg/kg Stuhl gemessen , was ohne \nFrage f\u00fcr einen Kenner als monstr\u00f6s kategorisiert werden kann. 70 \u00b5g ??  ..und das ganz OHNE \nProvokation durch einen Metallchelatoren wie  DMSA , DMPS oder Alpha Lipons\u00e4ure ?  Das Ergebnis war \nohne Frage bemerkenswert und damit auch klar , ... diese Plomben m\u00fcssen raus .- 4 -\nIm Mai 2010 wurden mir so dann diese Plomben entfernt und es folgte eine viele Monate dauernde \nDetoxphase !  Zu unserer aller \u00dcberraschung konnten sich im Zuge dieser Therapiema\u00dfnahme (FAST) \nALLE  einstig auff\u00e4lligen Labormarker nicht nur verbessern ,sie f\u00fchrte auch zur KOMPLETTEN \nNormalisierung so mancher dieser einstig auff\u00e4lligen Laborparameter.\nWas an dieser Sache allerdings AM MEISTEN \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigte , war das Folgende: Ca. 1,5 Jahre nach der \nEntfernug der Plomben und der darauf folgenden Detox wurden die (ALLE!)  Allergiescanns auf \nNahrungsmittel wiederholt und ,. wie durch ein \u201cmedizinisches Wunder\u201d:  DIESE ALLERGIEN WAREN \nALLE , REST & SPURLOS VERSCHWUNDEN !!\nDamit wurde ein medizinisches Dogma und Paradigma , das besagt , dass Allergien unheilbar w\u00e4ren verletzt \nund gebrochen .  Der Leser wird verstehen , dass eine solche Erfahrung f\u00fcr das Leben eines Menschen \npr\u00e4genden Charakter hat und dass man sich im Zuge solcher Entwicklung selbst weiter an dieser \n\u201cAmagamfront\u201d sei es auf gesundheitspolitischer und/oder sozialer Ebene engagiert , ja , engagieren MUSS !\nWie ich eingangs schon darauf hinwies  bildete mein einstiger Chemielehrgang mit einem sehr guten \nVerst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr diese Sache , so wie mein gutes  Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr Englisch eine sehr gute Grundlage  sich \nviel wertvolles Material hierzu selbst aus dem Netz \u201czu graben\u201d . Daher war viel Zeit meiner Freizeit \u00fcber die \nJahre im meiner eigenen Researcht\u00e4tigkeit  einschl\u00e4gigen Seiten gewidmet , die dieses Thema nicht \npopul\u00e4rwissenschaftlich, sondern M\u00d6GLICHST  \u201cprofessionell\u201d  thematisieren.\nEine der sehr wichtigen Seiten hier bildet die Studiendatenbank von Pubmed , die mittlerweile schon rd. 25 \nMio Artikel und Arbeiten aus allen Bereichen  der Medizin und der Medizin affillierten Wissenschaften \numfasst !  UNTER ANDEREM DORT  konnte ich \u00fcber die Jahre sehr viele interessante \u201cF\u00e4lle\u201d ausgraben , \ndie einem in dieser Sache sehr gut weiter helfen konnten.\nDas \u201cGraben\u201d auf einschl\u00e4gigen Seiten im Netz ist oft ein sehr m\u00fchsames und zeitraubendes Gesch\u00e4ft und \nmit der Zeit vermisste ich so etwas ,. wie eine gut zusammen gestellte Linksamlung zum Thema \n\u201cKRITISCHE Betrachtungen und Studien zum Thema Zahnamalgam und dem damit verbundenen Thema \nToxikologie des Quecksilbers.\nDas , was ich hier im Netzt \u00fcber die Jahre finden konnte ist relativ d\u00fcrftig !  Wenn \u00fcberhaupt , enthalten sie \noft nur ein paar wenige Links , oder es sind Sammlungen von Hinweisen zu Arbeiten , Autoren und/oder \nTiteln von Studien & Arbeiten OHNE VERLINKUNG !  Mir war es wichtig in einer Sammlung AUCH DIE \nJEWEILIGEN VERLINKUNGEN zu den Arbeiten vorfinden zu k\u00f6nnen ( SO VIELE WIE M\u00d6GLICH) und da \nes davon so gut wie nichts Brauchbares gab  , entschlo\u00df ich mich diese Sache selbst in die Hand zu \nnehmen und erstellte nun diese Linkliste. \nDiese Liste hier , die nun zweifelsohne WELTWEIT die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Linksammlung seiner Art (geworden) sein \nd\u00fcrfte , soll  NICHT NUR dem Zweck der Kollektivierung zahnamalgam und Hg-kritischem Studienmaterials \num damit dem Leser das Arbeiten in dieser Materie erleichtern zu k\u00f6nnen, dienen ,sie soll vor allem dem \nBestreben  im  Kampf gegen das Zahnamalgam und dem weltweiten Quedcksilberverbot eine gute \nSch\u00fctzenhilfe leisten k\u00f6nnen , indem sie SO \u2013konzentiert \u2013 (sehr) viel Argumentationshilfe wie m\u00f6glich dabei \neinbringen kann.\nLetzteres war f\u00fcr mich die WICHTIGSTE  Motivationsgrundlage diese Liste zu erstellen.\nM\u00fcnchen im Juli 2013 \n  \n - 5 - \n \nZUR VERWENDUNG DIESER LISTE.\nDie Liste selbst wurde  in Englischer Sprache beibehalten , da Englisch zum Einen die weltweite anerkannte \nWissenschaftssprache ist und zum Anderen , weil die Titel der jeweilgen Studien , so wie die aus den \nAbstracts und Studies entnommenen \u201cCoremessages\u201d - also die Kernbotschaften die ich aus den Studien \n/Abstracts  herauskopiert und so hier \u00fcbernommen habe -  so in Englischer Sprache geblieben sind . Das \nbeibehalten dieser Arbeit in Englisch hat seine Vorteile , da sie so WELTWEIT leichter im Kampf gegen \ndiesen Amalgam & Quecksilberwahnsinn eingesetzt werden kann .\nDie Aufgliederung der Informationen und Links dieser Arbeiten erfolgt jeweils \u00fcber mehre Zeilen wobei jeder \nLink/Arbeit entsprechend dem Kapiel dem er/sie zugeh\u00f6rt durchnummeriert wurde. In der ersten Zeile finden \nwir jeweils die Nummerierung fett markiert. Daraufhin folgt in der n\u00e4chsten Zeile. DER TITEL dieser Arbeit . \nSodann folgt in der n\u00e4chsten Zeile DER LINK zu dieser Arbeit. In der daraufhin folgenden Zeile teile ich mit , \nob diese Arbeit unter diesem Link voll zug\u00e4nglich ist  (FULL ACCESS TO STUDY) , oder diese nur als \nAbstract (Abstract only) vorliegt. \nNun folgt die Angabe \u201cCoremessage/s\u201d . Unter dieser Angabe finden wir sodann DAS WICHTIGSTE \nkomprimiert - als \u201cKernbotschaft\u201d dieser Studie - aus dieser Studie (meist die Ergebnisse) in Beziehung zum \nTitel der Studie, Ich habe hierzu fast ausschlie\u00dflich die entsprechenden S\u00e4tze (Botschaften)  aus den unter \ndiesen Links vorgefundenen Studies herauskopiert und hier als \u201cCormessage/s\u201d eingef\u00fcgt.\nDiese Arbeit hier teilt sich auf auf 3 gro\u00dfe Abschnitte. Teil 1 umfasst alle gefundenen kritischen Arbeiten die \nim DIREKTEN UND INDIREKTEN Zusammenhang zu Amalgam stehen. Teil 2 umfasst s\u00e4mtliche kritischen \nArbeiten im Bezug auf Hg (Quecksilber) OHNE direkten , oder indirekten Bezug zu Zahamalgam.  Teil 3 \nwurde m\u00f6glichen Kausalit\u00e4tsketten gewidmet. So z.B. Der Sache einer m\u00f6glichen \u2013 UND SOGAR SEHR \nWAHRSCHEINLICHEN -- genetisch bedingten Suszeptibilit\u00e4t gegen\u00fcber Hg , resp. Zahamalgam:  GSTM1 \n \nDA ICH SELBST GSTM1 NULL -TYP bin und ich im Zusammenhang meines Engagements hier (auch im \nNetz) weitere Betroffene kennen lernen konnte , sind  mir \u2013 einschlie\u00dflich mir selbst \u2013 4 weitere F\u00e4lle \nbekannt , die einer \u201cAmalgamerkrankung/Unvert\u00e4glichkeit\u201d  zugeordnet werden k\u00f6nnen UND die allesamt \nEBENFALLS DEM GSTM1 NULL Typen angeh\u00f6ren. Mir ist bis Dato noch kein Fall (eines Erkrankten) unter \ngekommen , der dem GSTM1 (+/+) ,(+/-),(-/+) zugeordnet werden kann . ICH FINDE DAS \nHOCHINTERESSANT UND VON GEWICHTIGER BEDEUTUNG !!\nDie Liste steht zur FREIEN Verwendung und soll so auch flei\u00dfig  ihren Einsatz , im Kampf gegen diesen \nweltweiten Amalgam & Hg \u2013 Wahnsinn finden k\u00f6nnen. Diese Liste kann (und soll) bei Bedarf auch auf hierzu \n\u2013 zu diesem Thema -- wichtigen Servern gehostet werden ! Allerding empfiehlt sich diese Arbeit nur AUF \nEINER Seite (Server) zu hosten , da es die Suchmaschine Google nicht gerne sieht , wenn eine Seite/Arbeit \nmit identischem Inhalt auf verschiedenen Webseiten gehostet wird (duplicate content & Spamverdacht !).\nDie Leser sind aufgefordert diese Arbeit zu erweitern. Sie kann bei Bedarf selbst geupdated und erweitert \nwerden mit Links , DIE NOCH NICHT Bestandteil dieser Liste sind. Dazu bedarf es allerdings meiner \nZustimmung. Alternativ kann man , wenn jemand einen Link zu einer KRITISCHEN Studie kennt --- DIE \nNOCH NICHT Bestandteil dieser Liste ist \u2013 auch mich selbst zu diesem Zweck kontaktieren. Ich werde dann \nentsprechend diese Liste mit diesem Link updaten. Zu erreichen bin ich hierzu unter der Emailadresse \nWichtig: Aufgenommen werden NUR kritische Arbeiten , die noch nicht Bestandteil dieser Liste sind und sie \nM\u00dcSSEN BEDINGUNGSLOS einen LINK vorweisen , auf dem WENIGSTENS der Abstract dieser Arbeit zu \nerreichen ist , ALLERWENIGSTENS \u2013 falls nicht mal ein Abstract vorliegt \u2013 muss der Link auf eine Seite \nf\u00fchren , wo diese Arbeit/Studie kostenpflichtig herunter geladen werden kann.

Frequent mobile phone use leads to increasing TSH-levels and to a derangement of thyroid hormones \n. \nAs we can see in Study Nr. 1  it could be found ,that mobile phone us can also lead to increasing  release of \nmercury from dental amlagam fillings. !  So , the question is: Couldn't it be possible , that the REAL reason \nfor increasing TSH Levels ist not mobilefunc by it's self , but through it's  mercury releasing effect ?  To \nanswer this question it would be usefull to contact both authors of both studies to bring them together for the \npurpose of answering this question by conducting a FURTHER study in which this possibility could be \ninvestigated.\nFor example in this way: Arrange to groups of heavy mobile phone users !

POSSIBLE CHAIN OF CAUSALITY Nr. 2 : (GSTM1 null in (nearly)  all \nknown neurodegenerative diseases)\nThe enzyme Glutathion -S -Transferase Type M1  , GSTM1 plays a major role in detoxification of esp. \naromatic toxins ( mainly out of the family of benzoles , phenoles & polyphenole componds) and heavy \nmetals. It is the \u201einstrument\u201c that is responsible for the coupling of these compunds (&heavy metals) to its \nassociated carrier \u201eGlutathion  through which these toxins can be excreted by the body through its natural \npathways . I.e. Mainly by  bile & feces. If this pathway of excretion is blocked through the lack of this enzyme \n, mercury (and other toxins) must be stored within the body , or , they are excreted through other ways , as \nwe can find in study Nr. 3 . The Gene GSTM1 codes for the expression of this enzyme , Glutathion S \u2013 \nTransferase. If there is a deletion of this Gen (GSTM1 NULL)  , the body of the carrier of  this  genetic \ndeficiency can not handle and excrete (these) toxins. This increases the susceptibility of the subject to esp. \nMercury and (very probably)  to every  other toxin as well.\nMercury is one of the most powerfull (neuro)-toxins we know and i think and i believe  that Mercury plays  the \nmost dominant role in all possible (chronic!) inroxications ,men can acquire ! Not only because mercury ist \nthe most potent neurotoxin we know  , but also because of its enormous ubiquity ! Finaly ,. nearly every one \ncarries this toxin within his mouth !  Out of these reason it is obvoius , that mercury should be responsible for \nthe MOST FREQUENT  (CHRONIC) intoxications in men (& wildlife too.).\nBecaus of this fact , and becaus of the fact that GSTM1 plays such an important role in the natural mercury \ndetoxification of our body , i began to investigate & research the frequeny of GSTM1 NULL cases in relation \nto all known neurodegenerative diseases we know on pubmed and to my surprise i found studies , that \nshowed , THAT IN (NEARLY) ALL KNOWN AND FREQUENT NEURODEGENARTIVE DISEASES GSTM1 \nNULL . TYPS ARE DOMINANT !!\nOut of this reason and out of the fact that GSTM1 ist the most important natural \u201edetoxifier\u201c of our bodies of \nMercury  - as shown in study Nr. 3 -  it is quite  obvious for me , that mercury should  play the most \ndominant role in the generation of all these neurodegenerative diseases.. \n3.2.1.\nStudy Nr. 3 finds that GSTM1 plays a central role in the ability of our body to detoxify our bodies of mercury:\nGlutathione-S-transferase polymorphism, metallothionein expression, and mercury levels among students in \nAustria.=\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17716707\nAbstract only \nCoremessage:\nWe focused on the relationship between polymorphisms in glutathione-S-transferase (GST) genes and \nmercury concentrations in blood, urine, and hair.

POSSIBLE CHAIN OF CAUSALTIY Nr.3 : (Mercury & oxidative Stress \n, MDA elevated in all neurodegenerative Diseases) \nMDA (Malone dialdehyde) is the most important marker for oxidative stress and it is a marker for lipid \nperoxidaton. The higher this marker is meassured , the higher the degree of lipid peroxidation , induced  -- \nfor example \u2013 through toxins like mercury. When lipid peroxidation is high , the level of this marker (MDA \n,Malone dialdehyde) rises. In  study Nr. 4 it is shown ,that havy metals lead to lipid peroxidation. If lipid \nperoxidation occurs , the marker MDA (Malone dialdehyde)  rises.  So we can find in Study Nr. 5. that \nmercury miners are chronicly exposed to mercury an  that their \u201ecorresponding\u201c MDA \u2013 levels are (chronicly) \nelevated to.\nAnd \u2013 as with GSTM1 \u2013 out of this reason and because of the fact , that mercury ist one of the most potent \nneurotoxins that exist AND because of its ubiquity  i guessed the possibility , that in all known \nneurodegenerative disorders MDA levels SHOULD be elevated in case toxins , esp. Mercury. are/is  the \nprimary candidate as a cause for these dieseases & disorders. Out of this possible perspective and \npossibility  , i did a research on pubmed and i was NOT dissapointed ! My findings showed , THAT IN ALL \nCASES OF NEUREDEGENERATIVE DISEASES AND KNOWN NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, MDA \nLEVELS ARE ELEVATED !!\nCould this be a mere coincidence ?  No ! With respect to these search results , i  dont believe so (any more) ! \nThis result \u2013 in association to my findings in relationship to GSTM1-  shows (should show)  AT LEAST ONE \ncertainty: That (environmental) toxins \u2013 is it mercury or not --  are THE MAIN CAUSE OF ALL THIS \nDISORDERS ! And , as mercury ist the most potent neurotoxin on earth and because at the same time \nmercury ist the MOST UBIQUITOUS toxin , mercury should be considered as the main culprit as a cause for \nall these diseases.. \n3.3.1.\nStudy 4 finds & shows that exposer to heavy metals (mercury) leads to lipid peroxidation & elevated MDA \n-levels:\nExperimentally induced lipid peroxidation after exposure to chromium, mercury or silver: interactions with \ncarbon tetrachloride.=<\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1579547\nAbstract only\nCoremessage:\nChromium, along with other heavy metals, induces an increased production of malondialdehyde (MDA), an \nindicator of lipid peroxidation, in liver and kidney tissue of NMRI male mice.\n3.3.2.\nStudy 5  finds that MDA-levels in mercury miners are (prob.chronicly) elevated:\nThe impact of long-term past exposure to elemental mercury on antioxidative capacity and lipid peroxidation \nin mercury miners.=>\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15139389\nCoremessage:\nAmong the observed lipid peroxidative products, the mean concentration of U-MDA was statistically higher (p \n< 0.01) in miners (0.21 micromol/mmol creatinine) than in the controls (0.17 micromol/mmol creatinine).
