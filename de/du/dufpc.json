Please send us your most recent findings and blood values to:\n[immumedicservice@gmail.com](mailto:immumedicservice@gmail.com?subject=Ihre Anfrage zur zweit oder Drittmeinung)\nIn a few days you will then receive a report with information as to whether a therapeutic measure with autologous dendritic cells including immune development can also have a chance of therapeutic success. You will also receive two to three studies.\nYou can then discuss with your doctor/physician whether a therapy measure is suitable for you.\nDendritic Cells/Vaccines\nResearch has been going on worldwide since the 1970s to fight tumors with dendritic cells. For this, Dr. Steinman and his team won the 2011 Nobel Prize in Medicine for discovering dendritic cells and their potential use in cancer.\nThe customer/patient request for immunological cancer therapies is growing steadily. Genetics and biology, with their possibilities of producing a customized vaccine for cancer therapy from the blood of the affected patients, is not only an alternative, in addition to standard therapy measures such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, but also a treatment method which, according to studies, has a 50% chance of remission. and a tumor burden reduction of 40%. The advantage of a cancer vaccination is obvious: no rejection and purely natural with minimal non-lasting side effects. If the quality of life is maintained, the autologous dendritic cells are able to be used as sole therapy or in combination therapies.\nWe offer our physicians/clinics the opportunity to provide their patients with personalized cancer therapy, another building block in the fight against cancer. As an international medical service provider with optimal logistics, we can supply our customers quickly and efficiently.\nThe time factor is decisive in fighting tumours\nAs a doctor, practice, clinic, we supply you with the necessary blood collection set from Tuesday to Friday. Blood samples for the production of autologous dendritic cells can always be collected from Monday to Wednesday. The cell suspensions are always delivered from Tuesday to Friday. The production time is 7 days. Capacity for the production of vaccines (dendritic cells) is 4 application series per day. A series of applications includes 4 x 2 injections.\nApplications of dendritic cells\nSince we carry the vaccine to fight tumors and metastases in us, we need a maximum of 200 ml of whole blood from adults. For children and the elderly, we need 50 to 150 ml of whole blood. The blood of the affected patient is required in the GMP laboratory in Germany for the production and propagation of dendritic cells. Further laboratories in Europe are planned.\n\"Prevent Cancer\"\nFor the preventive use of autologous dendritic cells, the dendritic cells are multiplied from 200 ml whole blood and loaded with antigens. Dendritic cell prevention is performed only once. Production time 7 days with a cell proliferation of 3 to 40 million cells. Preventive \"cancer vaccination\" makes sense for customers who have already been diagnosed with cancer in their family. The probability of one's own illness is around 85% according to the current study situation. Thus, the chance of developing cancer is reduced by around 50-70% after a cancer vaccination.\n\"Combination therapy with dendritic cells\"\nSince the first cancer vaccinations, scientists and complementary medicine practitioners have known how to bring about a synergy against cancer with combination therapy measures. This is where the dendritic cells are produced before treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The blood is taken beforehand because the blood has not yet been contaminated by the toxins or has not been changed by radiotherapy. Studies have shown that combination therapy can reduce the side effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, such as less or no hair loss and less or no pain. Many patients describe that they were much more agile and full of life during chemotherapy. It was also described that the very common depressions did not occur. A combination therapy is discussed with the doctors and planned in detail. During the breaks, i.e. between the therapy units of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, a series of applications with dendritic cells is injected once a month. It was also reported that the tumor had reduced faster with the help of autologous dendritic cells. The metastases are also optimally and sustainably combated by the dendritic cells.\nProcessing of a therapeutic measure with autologous dendritic cells\nBlood samples - set\nArriving blood samples at the laboratory\nDelivery of the autologous cells\nThe blood sample set will be sent to your doctor/practice for collection. Blood collection of 200 ml whole blood in 50 ml cannulas. Collection of the blood samples in a special container by our medical logistics on the same day of collection.\nAfter the blood samples have arrived in the GMP laboratory, your blood will be checked to see whether there are enough cells in the blood plasma for an optimal therapeutic measure. Beginning of maturation of the dendritic progenitor cells. Maturation and loading with antigens takes 7 days.\nOn the 7th day after the start of production, the cells are washed and the first of 4 application series (two applications each for the right/left side of the lymph nodes in the groin area subcutaneously) is completed and delivered directly to your doctor/practice within 12-18 hours via Medical Logistics for allocation. In Europe overnight.\nThe remaining application series are then given monthly and are deep-frozen until they are awarded.", "language": null, "image": "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80f8f9_6d3bffde31db4d4c85d3b53a67b69ecd~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_800,h_533,al_c/80f8f9_6d3bffde31db4d4c85d3b53a67b69ecd~mv2.jpg", "pagetype": "website", "links": ["https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/darmkrebs", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/cart-page", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/tumorz\u00e4hlung", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/newsletter", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/blog/archive/2023/05", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/dendritische-zelltherapie", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/was-ist-krebs", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/hyperthermie-dendritische-zelltherapie", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/immunst\u00e4rkung", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/apoptose-krebs", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/stammzellen", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/autoimmunerkrankung", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/krebsratgeber-mensch", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/krebsarten-therapien", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/tumorarten", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/services-3-1", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/presse", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/kooperation-immumedic", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/kopie-von-kooperation-arzt-klink", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/services-4", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/gesundheitsberatung-krebs", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/kopie-von-presse", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/studien", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/blog", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/impressum", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/datenschutz", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/contact-9", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/kontakt", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/newsletter", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/sitemap", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/webkatalog", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/search", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/shop", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/immuseroforte-1", "mailto:info@mysite.com", "mailto:immumedicservice@gmail.com?subject=Ihre Anfrage zur zweit oder Drittmeinung", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/studien", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/immumedic", "https://twitter.com/ImmumedicRach", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwSlZRDPqBw", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/impressum", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/datenschutz", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/contact-9", "https://www.immuntherapie-krebs.net/en/kontakt", "https://web2.cylex.de/firma-home/immumedic-limited-13786115.html?utm_campaign=review%20widget%20small&utm_source=https%3A%2F%2F2ab03bab-7112-4b33-a95a-e026fa04af4d.filesusr.com%2Fhtml%2F80f8f9_2d389d7fe78b6083ced7fc2f427b1e6c.html&utm_medium=widget%20small&utm_content=title%20link#reviews"]}
