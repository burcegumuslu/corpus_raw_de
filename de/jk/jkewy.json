Clinically proven (3 clinical trials) and patented by the laboratory KGK Synergize, it has been developed naturally from oranges (Citrus L sinensis) and palm fruits (Elaeis guineensis), and comes in ultra-absorbable capsules(softgels).\nWhat is hypercholesterolaemia?\nHypercholesterolaemia is one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular disease along with smoking, high blood pressure and diabetes. At excess levels and under pressure from certain factors, LDL-cholesterol, the most atherogenic fraction of cholesterol, accumulates in artery walls, contributing to atheromatous plaque.\nWe refer to it as hypercholesterolaemia when LDL-cholesterol levels exceed 1.6g/l, which is the case for 30% of the adult populationin the West.\nPeople in this category have a preventable risk of cardiovascular and circulatory diseases (which cause a quarter of all deaths in the UK) : several meta-analyses showed that lowering cholesterol (total or LDL) reduced cardiovascular events as well as mortality risk (cardiovascular and all-cause) (1-2).\nBefore starting any drug treatment, health professionals normally recommend making appropriate diet and lifestyle changes, possibly combined with natural supplementation for a period of three months. If LDL-cholesterol levels remain too high after this period, lipid-lowering medication can be prescribed.\nHow do elevated blood lipid levels cause atherosclerosis?\nLDL-cholesterol, which serves as a vehicle for transporting cholesterol, has a tendency to settle in parts of the blood vessel walls under the effect of certain factors (oxidation, glycation or degradation): this is the start of hardening of the arteries. Specialist \u2018cleaning up\u2019 cells called macrophages are subsequently deposited, followed by other cells, to the point where they form a fatty plaque which impedes the circulation. But the danger really comes when this plaque ruptures: a piece of the plaque can then block the artery downstream where the blood vessel is narrower, causing a heart attack or stroke.\nHypercholesterolaemia therefore drives hardening of the arteries. The longer you wait to address it, the worse the damage becomes.\nWhere does LDL-cholesterol come from? Why do levels rise?\nContrary to popular belief, excess LDL-cholesterol does not come from eating too much dietary cholesterol (except in the case of familial hypercholesterolemia), but from endogenous over-production. This is the result of several factors: a diet too high in trans fatty acids or too low in omega-3, diabetes, obesity, ageing, smoking or stress \u2026.\nWhy does Sytrinol contain tocotrienols?\nThe term \u2018vitamin E\u2019 actually describes a family of 8 molecules with a similar chemical structure: four tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) and four tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta). These molecules play a role in protecting blood lipids like cholesterol (3), which are susceptible to being oxidised and going on to form atheromatous plaques.\nThe \u2018tail\u2019 of tocotrienols is always shorter than that of tocopherols, which gives tocotrienols greater mobility and the ability to cover a wider cell membrane surface. That\u2019s why this form of vitamin E has been chosen for Sytrinol. Tocotrienols are fat-soluble compounds which are very well absorbed by the body. Studies have clearly shown that tocotrienols rapidly navigate to organs and tissues higher in adipose content such as the liver, brain, spleen, lungs, kidneys and heart.\nHow should you take the supplement Sytrinol?\nWe recommend taking two capsules a day, one with each of your two main meals, as tocotrienols are fat-soluble.\nTo optimise Sytrinol\u2019s efficacy, it\u2019s a good idea to follow these steps while you are supplementing:\n- Significantly increase the proportion of fruits, vegetables, nuts and wholegrains in your diet.\n- Use herbs, spices, garlic and onion as much as possible, as they are all rich in antioxidants.\n- Restrict your consumption of poultry and red meat, and instead choose fish and seafood wherever possible.\n- Take some exercise every day (a walk after a meal, a sports activity\u2026).\n- Take a daily multivitamin supplement (\n[\nDaily 3](/en/shop/strengthening-organism/daily-3-supplement-0578) is the gold standard).\n- Try other specialist supplements such as\n[\nOlive Leaf Extract](/en/shop/blood-sugar-cholesterol/olive-leaf-extract-supplement-0770), a triple-action Mediterranean formulation for controlling blood cholesterol and triglycerides, or [\nRed Yeast Rice Extract](/en/shop/blood-sugar-cholesterol/red-yeast-rice-extract-supplement-0562), a natural alternative to statins.\n- Stop smoking as a priority, and learn to manage your stress better if appropriate.", "language": null, "image": "https://www.supersmart.com/data/articles/0386_FBC.jpg", "pagetype": null, "links": ["tel:00 44 (0)2 03 49 96 281", null,
