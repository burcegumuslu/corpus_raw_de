They served as a strategic tool for the development of hitherto backward areas, they helped to penetrate regions far away from the political and economic centres and to open them up to the achievements of the \u2018civilised world\u2019. \u2018Because railways can change spatial realities, they have been a favoured tool of empire builders.\u2019*** Until the end of the 1860s, the main railway lines had been completed in **** Western, Southern and Central Europe. In the European East there were then still vast parts of the Russian Empire which had to be covered by a railway network. The Balkan peninsula, most of it still under Ottoman rule, also needed urgently, according to contemporary observers, this new way of communication and transport. It should have provided economic development and better and faster political and military control for the new states which had sprung up recently in this part of Europe, like Serbia, Montenegro or the Moldavian principalities, and for the rulers in Constantinople who tried to modernise the empire of the \u2018sick man of Europe\u2019.\n*Peter Hertner \u2013 Universitait Halle-Wittenberg, Institut f\u00fcr Geschichte. **Fremdling, R.

Baron Hirsch and the Oriental Railways, 1869\u20131890 Already in the 1860s the Turkish government had granted railway concessions to foreign investors: one was situated in the Dobrudja region and was to link Cernavoda on the Danube river to Constanza on the Black Sea \u2013 altogether just 64 kilometers, built and managed by British capital. When this region became later a part of Rumania the government in Bucharest bought the 1 line in 1882 from its British shareholders. The other one was to link Rustchuck, again on the Danube but more upstream, to Varna which was to become the major Bulgarian port on the Black Sea. According to Rondo Cameron, it \u2019 ... was a truly international enterprise, with French engineers, British contractors, Belgian materiel, and capital from all three as well as the 2 Netherlands\u2019. This line had a length of 225 kilometers and was opened in 3 1867. None of these two lines really lived up to original expectations, i.e. to link West and East in a quicker and safer way \u2013 navigation on the Danube proved to be just too slow and complicated and loading from railways to ships and back again took too much time; thus the Mediterranean route from Marseille or Brindisi to Constantinople remained the preferred one for travel4 lers and exporters from Western Europe until the end of the 1880s. The idea of building a railway which would then connect \u2018the English Channel to the Persian Gulf\u2019 dates back to the 1840s and 1850s. In 1855, during the Crimean War, the Sublime Porte suggested such a project to Western investors,5 and, the following year, \u2018Palmerston, who opposed the idea of a Suez Canal, wrote that the real communication with India must be a railway to Constantinople, and from there through Asia Minor to the Persian Gulf \u20196 \u2013 a Baghdad Railway ante litteram. Nothing came out of these and other ideas and initiatives because the Ottoman Government did not show any further interest in such projects. After it had been evicted from Germany in 1866, Austria became increasingly interested in its Balkan \u2018backyard\u2019 and thus presumably also in the big\nDimtschoff, R. M.

Behind Van der Elst & Cie we find the Belgian financier Langrand-Dumonceau who tried to form a Catholic financial group during the 1860s; he was engaged in the provision of finance to the Pope and in numerous railway speculations.9 Langrand-Dumonceau\u2019s group collapsed a few months afterwards, it had not been able to collect all the capital needed for this big undertaking. By June 1869, the Ottoman government declared the provisional railway concession which it had granted to Van der Elst a year before to have become invalid.10 Who was to take Langrand-Dumonceau\u2019s place? It was a comparatively small private banker from Brussels, Baron Maurice de Hirsch \u2013 or Moritz von Hirsch, as he had been called in Bavaria, the country of origin of his family. He was born in Munich in 1831 and his father Joseph von Hirsch was a banker to three kings of Bavaria and a descendant of the Hoffaktoren, a Jewish family. Apart from his personal ambitions and his remarkable capability as a financier Moritz von Hirsch became successful as an investment banker thanks to his close relations to the Bischoffsheim family, bankers in Brussels, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Paris and London after having left Mainz. This was one th of the most important family of bankers in 19 century Europe. Moritz von Hirsch married Clara Bischoffsheim in 1855, moved to Munich and then again to Brussels about three years later where he founded Banque Bischoffsheim de Hirsch together with his brother-in-law. It was a private banking house which twelve years later became one of the founders of 11 Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas. From 1871 he lived mostly in Paris. According to Paul Emden the Bischoffsheims \u2018... allowed him [Hirsch, P.H.] to use the organisation of the banking house of Bischoffsheim & Goldschmidt\nDP/4 DP/ 53/ 6/200 2 0 065\n7\n6\nIn the early 1860s Austria still favoured a line which would have run through Transylvania and the Carpathians down to the Danubian principalities \u2013 which would later on become Rumania \u2013 and from there to the Danube which then still formed the border with the Ottoman Empire (Rechberger, W.

On April 12 1869 Moritz von Hirsch signed a concession agreement with the Imperial Ottoman Government \u2018... for the construction and operation of a railway network in European Turkey which was to connect Constantinople 13 with Vienna ...\u2019. It is not quite clear if Hirsch entered into the previous agreement between the Sublime Porte and Langrand-Dumonceau or if he came himself to terms with Constantinople. At the beginning Hirsch seems to have desired a clear distinction between the construction of the network, a task he wanted to take up himself, and its operation where he desired to engage the South-Austrian Railway, the well-known S\u00fcdbahn, founded by the Rothschilds, which, however, withdrew its approval at the very last moment. The Austrian State Railways, a private firm despite its name which had been 14 created by the P\u00e9reire brothers, also refused to participate. Hirsch was therefore practically forced to found by himself, as an operating company, the Paris-based Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour l\u2019Exploitation des Chemins de Fer de la Turquie d\u2019Europe in January 1870. Its principal shareholders were the 15 Anglo-Austrian Bank in Vienna, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Paris , the Banque Bischoffsheim de Hirsch in Brussels as well as Moritz von Hirsch. \u2018Chairman 16 and negotiator with the Turkish authorities on behalf of the new company\u2019 17 was Paulin Talabot, \u2018the French ironmaster and railway magnate\u2019. Besides Baron Hirsch and the directors of the construction company, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Imp\u00e9riale des Chemins de Fer de la Turquie d\u2019Europe, consisted mainly of representatives of the Anglo-Austrian Bank and of people who seem to have been close collaborators of Hirsch. \u2018Each of the two companies was regis\u201918 tered with a capital of 50 million francs of which one quarter was paid up.\nEmden, P.

Histoire de la maison Rothschild, vol. 2 (Geneva, 1967), p. 526. 15 The Parisian Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale participated by subscribing one third of the original capital of 50 million francs but decided to take shares for a nominal amount of 8 million francs; the rest was to be offered to \u2018participants\u2019 who might be interested and particularly to the members of its Conseil d\u2019Administration (SG.AH, minutes of the Conseil d\u2019Administration, 329e s\u00e9ance du 11 Janvier 1870).

The Turkish government agreed to pay a higher subsidy for the construction cost of the line in the mountains of Bosnia.20 Particularly original was the solution found for financing this huge enter21 prise. Hirsch became famous all over Europe by creating the so-called T\u00fcrkenlose, ... an entirely novel type of Government loan: the 3 per cent. Turkish Lottery Bonds which carried a low rate of interest but were paid off by drawings every two months at a very high redemption price; they enjoyed great favour amongst small investors on the Continent, especially in France and in Germany, and continued to do so although as early as 1875 the Sublime Porte defaulted on the drawings which, however, were resumed in 1881 (under the Decree of Mouharrem); payment of interest stopped in 1876.22 There were however two substantial problems related to these lottery bonds: first of all, this type of bonds could not be officially quoted at the Vienna, the Paris or the London stock exchange. In Paris this was forbidden by a law from 1836, in Vienna stock exchange regulations did not admit these bonds to official trading. An exception had been made before in the case of the Suez Canal lottery bonds but then above all France and Austria had showed a strong political interest in that specific item. The other fly in the\nDP/4 DP/ 53/ 6/200 2 0 065\n19\n8\nCf the handwritten copy of the Convention de la concession of 17 April 1869 and the printed copy of the Convention principale d\u2019exploitation of the same date, in: HADB, OR 530. 20 Grunwald, K. T\u00fcrkenhirsch, p. 34. 21 At the beginning \u2018... the Anglo-Austrian Bank provided the Balkan railway company with short-term bridging funds until there was a flow of capital available from the bond issues\u2019 (Cottrell, P. L. London Financiers, p. 117). 22 Emden, P. H. Money Powers, p. 322. \u2013 Christopher Clay (Gold for the Sultan. Western Bankers and Ottoman Finance, 1856\u20131881: a Contribution to Ottoman and International Financial History (London and New York, 2000), p. 199) describes the solution adopted by de Hirsch with these lottery bonds in the following manner: \u2018... to go over the heads of the great financial institutions, to issue the loan in a form designed not to appeal to well-informed bankers and their affluent or relatively affluent clients but to less sophisticated small investors who could not normally be tempted to subscribe to Ottoman valeurs at all\u2019.\nointment was the way the six monthly drawings of the lottery bonds were arranged: all those bonds not yet sold or even not yet issued participated in the drawings and fell automatically to Hirsch\u2019s company. Thus \u2018... the chances of getting even a small prize were exceedingly remote for all save the very largescale investors\u2019,23 and soon people started to talk of a case of \u2018organized theft\u2019.24 After a long back-and-forth between Hirsch and the Austrian government the T\u00fcrkenlose were finally quoted at the Vienna Exchange on 27 June 1870. The French government had promised to follow immediately but in fact it did not, and shortly afterwards the Second Empire broke down and France had more important problems to tackle.25 The first series of these bonds sold very well thanks to a well-organised 26 publicity campaign and in spite of the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. 27 The second series, issued in September 1872, fell into a much more difficult period and only part of it could be sold, the remaining bonds had to be taken 28 back by the syndicate of issuing banks. When the Ottoman state suspended its payments for all debt services in 1875, the quotation of the T\u00fcrkenlose fell from an original high of 180 to a low which fluctuated between 20 and 30. From 1882 drawings were again honoured albeit only par29 tially. If we can believe the figures presented by Karl Morawitz, himself a banker and later on head of the Anglo-Austrian Bank, the profit made out of the entire business until Hirsch\u2019s retreat in 1890 should have been 160 to 170 million francs, a sum which Morawitz thinks to be a more or less fair reward for \u2018the enormous amount of labour, diligence and intelligence\u2019 applied by \u2018a small banker from Brussels\u2019 in such a hostile and difficult environment offered by a \u2018half-barbarian country as it was the case with the interior parts of Turkey 30 thirty years ago\u2019.

Given the impredictable shape of politics at the Sultan\u2019s court this meant, to begin with, close contacts with the ruling elite. In the words of David Landes \u2018... one may be sure that much influence with government was bought \u2013 tactfully, through gratuities and accomodations, and crudely, by bribes\u2019 \u2013 and Landes does not only refer to 32 the well-known backward conditions on the shore of the Bosporus ... . Hirsch had been lucky enough to get his concession when the \u2018Western-oriented Grand Vizier Ali Pasha\u2019 who favoured a railway link with Western Europe was governing the Ottoman Empire. He died in September 1871 and his successor Mahmud Nedim Pasha followed a completely different line by preferring rail connections with Russia via Rumania to any direct link with Western Europe via Austria-Hungary. This thoroughly changed situation led to a revised concession agreement with the Oriental Railway Company. Thus by a new contract in 1872 the overall length of the network was reduced to 33 1,260 kilometers. Still, in 1872 construction was well under way, starting from Constantinople and from the Aegean coast. 387 kilometers were already in operation, \u2018... 102 ready for operation and 661 under construction, \u2013 alto34 gether 1,150 kilometers\u2019. People who lived along the future track were rather sceptical when the first surveyors arrived: the Bulgarians feared that they would be recruited as forced labourers by the Ottoman authorities, the Turks thought that railways were \u2018too European\u2019 for their future lives; only the Greek traders were enthusiastic when they considered their coming business 35 chances. In spite of ongoing construction work the connection to the West \u2013 through Bosnia or through Serbia \u2013 remained still to be made. By the end of 1872, part of the Bosnian line had been completed but in 1876 the operating company gave it back to the Ottoman government which so far had refused to connect it with the Austro-Hungarian network. \u2018After a few months of Ot-\nDP/4 DP/ 53/ 6/200 2 0 065\n31\n10\nG.

This goes with Grundwald\u2019s comment: \u2018It can be safely assumed that Hirsch had to pay his way in Turkey, as was customary\u2019 (Grunwald, K. T\u00fcrkenhirsch, p. 52). 33 Morawitz, Ch.

Thus the railway project 38 meanwhile consisted of three isolated lines\u2019. Unfortunately, in October 1875 the Ottoman state suspended all its payments. In two decades it had borrowed 2.5 billion francs, of which more than nine tenths came from 39 abroad. Between 1869 and 1875 \u2018 ... the nominal value of new borrowing 40 exceeded the estimated revenues of the central government ... .\u2019 Morawitz calculated that only about 10 per cent of this huge debt had been used for 41 the building of the new infrastructure, above all railways. Six years later, in 1881, \u2018... a contract was concluded between the Ottoman government and the representatives of its foreign and domestic creditors for the resumption of payments on Ottoman bonds. This agreement, called the Decree of Mouharrem (from the Turkish month in which it was drafted), instituted Euro42 pean control of a part of the imperial revenues\u2019. Meanwhile, railway construction in the European part of the Ottoman Empire had come to a standstill, not least because of Anti-Turkish revolts in Bosnia and Bulgaria between 1875 and 1878 and, of course, also as a consequence of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878. The Congress of Berlin of 1878 entrusted the new state of Bulgaria as a successor of the Ottoman Empire within its new boundaries in article 10 of the agreement with the task of providing for 43 a railway link with Austria-Hungary.

This is all the more convincing since the lines built until the middle of the 1870s linked Mediterranean ports like Salonica or Dedeagatch or Black Sea ports like Varna with the interior parts of the Balkan peninsula without yet offering connections to Central Europe (see for instance Grunwald, K. 1966, pp. 44\u201348; Paskaleva, V. 1982, p. 512). 37\nDISCUSSION PAPERS\n11\ndes chemins de fer de la Turquie d\u2019Europe was explicitly mentioned in this paragraph. Also in 1878, Hirsch transferred the operating company from Paris to Vienna and replaced its French directors with Austro-Hungarian members.44 Again according to Article 10 of the Berlin Treaty, Bulgaria \u2018... had to guarantee 7,000 francs per km each year to the company [Hirsch\u2019s operating company, P.H.] and was entitled to only half of the profit over and above this amount. This arrangement, which was hardly designed to make the railroads profitable, remained in force until Bulgaria nationalized the line during the 1908 crisis\u2019.45 Only four years later, in 1882, the delegates of Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia and Austria-Hungary met in Vienna in a conf\u00e9rence \u00e0 quatre and reached an agreement in March 1883 which provided for the construction of two missing railway links: one from Bellovo via Sofia, Nish and Belgrad to Semlin in Hungary, the other from Nish to Wranja and from there to Skopje \u2013 \u00dcsk\u00fcb in Turkish \u2013 and thus to the line connecting Mitrovitza and Salonica.46 The Ottoman Government, however, was not in a hurry to translate these decisions into action, particularly when Bulgaria occupied Eastern Rumelia, which formally still was an autonomous province of the Turkish Empire, and with it the railway lines as soon as they had been finished there in 1888.47 The Sublime Porte wanted to react but did not have the means, not least because of European financial control of an important part of its income. Thus Hirsch, probably weary of the eternal conflicts with Constantinople, reached a compromise in 1885 providing the Ottoman administration with an \u2018advance\u2019 of 23 million francs, to be paid out of means he had so far withheld because of alleged violations of the existing contract with the Ottoman side.48 Bulgaria had opted for a state-owned railway system in 1884 and it was the Bulgarian state that had constructed the last missing link which, after its inauguration in 1888, made the through traffic possible from Vienna to\nDP/4 DP/ 53/ 6/200 2 0 065\n44\n12\nMorawitz, Ch.

Georg Siemens of Deutsche Bank would have eventually preferred to sell the Eastern Rumelian part of the Oriental network to Bulgaria but his partners in Vienna, and with them the Ottoman government, opposed such a solution. In order to find a modus vivendi favourable to his bank and to the Oriental Railways Siemens put pressure on Bulgaria by starting an action against its loans at the Berlin stock exchange. Thus in 1899 he succeeded in forcing Bulgaria to accept an agreement with the Betriebsgesellschaft of the Oriental Railways: the Betriebsgesellschaft would lower its tariffs putting them on the same level fixed by the Bulgarian state lines; on the other hand, it would from now on take over the management of a parallel railway line of which 80 km had already been constructed by the Bulgarian state in order to put pressure on the Oriental Railways.50 As a consequence of the Congress of Berlin, Serbia had become also formally independent in 1878. On this occasion it had gained some additional territory in the South, including Nish, from the Ottoman Empire. The wellknown French banker \u2013 or better: speculator \u2013 Eug\u00e8ne Bontoux and the group he had formed around the Union G\u00e9n\u00e9rale concluded a contract with the Serbian government in April 1881 which provided for a loan of nominally 100 million francs from the Union G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, the construction of a railway network in Serbia and the creation of an operating company. Bontoux and his group went bankrupt in January 1882 but the Serbian government managed to transfer the entire business to another Parisian bank, the Comptoir 51 d\u2019Escompte de Paris, which just carried it on. By 1884 a line had been constructed which went from Semlin, on the border to Austria-Hungary, to Belgrad and from there to Nish. Two lines, one from Nish to the Bulgarian border, the other one from Nish to Wranja where it met the Turkish network, were completed in 1886 and 1887. In the following year the missing piece on\n13\nthe Turkish side between Wranja and Skopje (\u00dcsk\u00fcb) was finished.52 On August 12, 1888, almost twenty years after the signing of the original concession, the first train left Vienna for Constantinople\u00b4.53 The distance covered amounted altogether to 1.686 km.54 The line from Belgrade to Salonica had been inaugurated already in May of the same year. The wife of Edouard Hentsch, a banker from Geneva who was president of the Comptoir d\u2019Escompte de Paris between 1872 and 1889, has left us a vivid account of the pomp and circumstance employed for the inauguration ceremonies.55 Thus the story of the Orient Express could finally start \u2013 at least in literature it began some decades later, as we know ... The Oriental network, once completed, was certainly a success of Western European finance and technology but, compared to what had been constructed before in Britain, France, Germany or even the Eastern parts of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, it represented a second-rate solution. Already in 1872 the Ottoman government had accused, not without afterthoughts, Hirsch of having chosen the cheapest way for construction by, for instance, building wooden 56 bridges instead of stone ones (Rechberger, W. 1958, p. 145). A commission of foreign experts which inspected the Roumelian lines in 1874 found out that not 57 all of the construction work had been really finished. In order to save capital the track, as it was built, frequently avoided to pass directly through nearby villages and towns. The result were \u2018railway stations without towns and towns without 58 railway stations\u2019. \u2018Most of the major towns in both central and western 59 Macedonia lay at a considerable distance from the railway line\u2019, and the roads linking these towns to the railway stations were generally in a rather bad shape. Besides, neither the Ottoman Empire nor, one or two decades later, Bulgaria and\nDP/4 DP/ 53/ 6/200 2 0 065\n52\n14\nJordan, P.

As a result, apart from the three principle lines in Macedonia for instance \u2018... the survival of horse and mule caravans testifies to the limited impact of these [...] lines on the Macedonian economy\u2019.60 Furthermore \u2018[...] trains were slow and could not catch up with European standards\u2019.61 Decades later, around 1900, the speed even of express trains was still only half of what such trains achieved in Britain or France,62 and this was certainly not only due to the difficulties of the ground in the Balkan hills and mountains but also to an insufficient substructure. Still, compared to the railways in the other parts of the Turkish Empire, the European network was in advance: \u2018In 1911, Ottoman railroads [...] in the Balkans contained 1,054 miles of track and carried 8 million passengers while those in Anatolia held 1,488 miles with 7 million passengers. By contrast, the 1,488 miles of track in the Arab provinces carried only 0.9 million, a reflection of the scant population\u2019.63 The well-known Baedeker travel guide tried to dampen tourists\u2019 fears when it underlined in its 1914 edition for \u2018Constantinople and Asia Minor\u2019 the fact that the trip to Constantinople would offer \u2018all sorts of comfort\u2019. The Orient Express which would subsequently become so famous was scheduled to make the journey from Budapest to Constantinople via Sofia four times a week. The one-way ticket for the 35-hour trip cost 171.30 francs. The ordinary fast train which ran daily needed 40 hours and a half for the same distance. In this case the first-class ticket amounted to 123.80 francs.64 Almost forty years before, in 1875, a German traveller going by train from Salonica to Mitrovitza in the Kossovo region needed no less than two days for this trip of about 365 kilometres with an obligatory overnight stop in \u00dcsk\u00fcb (Skopje). He spoke of this railway as of \u2018so to speak an embryo or at the most a child full of the best promises\u2019 since in those years links to Central Europe had not yet been constructed.65 On the other hand, as it happened practically in all regions outside Western and Central Europe and North America at least until 1914, with Tsarist Russia being a partial exception, the construction of the Oriental Railways meant that investment goods were ordered in and delivered from the main industrial countries. To give but a few examples relating to our case: in 1881, the operating\n15\ncompany of the Oriental Railways employed 105 locomotives of which 14 came from Austrian producers, 3 came from France, 11 had been imported from Belgium and the same number came from Britain. The entire rest, 66 machines, had been delivered by German suppliers. By far most of the 2,483 wagons came equally from Germany, a small number from Belgian and French suppliers.66 By then also most of the original 257 wooden bridges used by the Oriental Railways had been substituted by iron ones. Almost 90 per cent of the iron used for these constructions came from two large German suppliers, the rest from a Belgian one.67 Construction of the track, bridges and station buildings had, at least in the Rumelian part between Bellovo and Adrianople, been carried out \u2018exclusively by German engineers, technicians and auxiliary staff\u2019,68 but there can be no doubt that indigenous labour had been used for all types of earth works.69 As to the personnel employed, unfortunately, it has not been possible so far to ferret out any reliable statistics on its size and structure. J\u00fcttner, in his report on the Oriental Railways dating from 1881, underlined that the Beamte, i.e. the managing staff, consisted to a large extent of German or Austrian citizens, \u2018par70 ticularly in the construction department\u2019. \u2018As was the case with all foreignowned companies operating in the Empire, the overwhelming majority of the 71 administrative staff, especially in the higher ranks, were Europeans\u2019. On the other hand, the \u2018native population is quite apt for the lower functions of the rail72 way service and is therefore increasingly employed for that purpose\u2019. In 1905\u20131906, only in the vilayet of Salonica, and not counting the personnel employed for service in the trains, there were about 2,000 people working for the 73 three railway companies which served this region. 66\nJ\u00fcttner, Die orientalischen Eisenbahnen, in: Archiv f\u00fcr Eisenbahnwesen, 5 (1882), pp. 209\u2013211.

During the 1880s he increasingly tried to get rid of his huge empire. From the spring of 1882 Hirsch had probably started to negotiate with the Imperial Ottoman Bank. This institution had been founded in 1862\u20131863 as a state bank by a Franco-British group. Until the First World War it was to be found \u2018everywhere in the Turkish economy dominating above all its commercial and financial relations with the outside world.74 Thus \u2018the history of Ottoman banking is in large measure the history of the Ottoman Bank\u2019, as David Landes has pointed out.75 The Ottoman Bank and its unknown partners from Vienna and Berlin \u2013 at least one of them can however be identified as having been the House of Bleichr\u00f6der \u2013 did not conclude the contract since they believed that there were still too many unsolved problems between Hirsch and the Ottoman Government which they would, had they taken over, have inherited.76 In 1883\u20131884 there were negotiations, without tangible results, between Hirsch and the Austrian State Railways, and in 1887 we can observe new talks between Hirsch and the Imperial Ottoman Bank, again to no avail.77 Finally, on 8 September 1888 Gerson von Bleichr\u00f6der and Julius Schwabach as representatives of the House of Bleichr\u00f6der, Adolf von Hansemann (DiscontoGesellschaft) and Messieurs Heine and Berger from the Ottoman Bank met in Ostende to discuss an eventual takeover of Hirsch\u2019s Oriental Railways. Among others they decided that participation of Austro-Hungarian banks, and possibly also British partners, should be sought for, that the German and the French partners should have an equivalent amount of shares and that each national industry should profit from orders for railway supplies according to national quotas attributed to the banks. The Ottoman Bank would continue its talks with Hirsch. Capital requirements would amount to a total sum of 110 to 120 million francs. A necessary condition for a definitive offer of this group of banks to Baron Hirsch Thobie, J. Int\u00e9r\u00eats et imp\u00e9rialisme fran\u00e7ais dans l\u2019empire ottoman (1895\u20131914) (Paris, 1977), pp. 81\u201389, quote on p. 81; Eldem, E.

There are also traces of contacts established during the same year with the Austrian Credit-Anstalt but possibly they were only part of negotiations started by Hirsch with the entire Rothschild group, and in this case Bleichr\u00f6der would have been included (ibidem).

Already in April 1888 the head of its Vorstand, Georg Siemens, had asked the German Foreign Ministry if it had any politically motivated objections to make against their buying up shares of the Oriental Rail80 ways. It did not. By the end of July, Deutsche Bank had started to become 81 seriously interested in the company, and two months later negotiations with Baron Hirsch concerning such an eventual sale were initiated by Deutsche Bank with the help of its old ally Wiener Bankverein. Both banks, the German and the Austrian one, wanted to send experts to Paris where they should collect detailed information on the operating company belonging to Oriental 82 Railways. This operating company had officially moved its seat to Vienna in 1879 but its administrative headquarters were still situated in Paris. Before things could advance further there was, however, an urgent need to improve the relationship between Hirsch and the Sublime Porte. Therefore already in the middle of the 1880s a group of independent arbitrators had been re83 84 cruited, another try was launched in 1888. In both cases Georg Siemens had been involved as one of the persons who were asked to propose feasible candidates. In October 1888 Siemens himself was looking for an expert with railway expertise since Deutsche Bank had obviously decided to buy a certain number of\nDP/4 DP/ 53/ 6/200 2 0 065\n78\n18\nIbidem: T\u00fcrkische Eisenbahnen.

Quite early Ernest Cassel, the well-known financier based in London,90 was involved as sort of a mediator since he had close connections with Hirsch as well as with Bischoffsheim & Goldschmidt.91 During all these months Siemens never lost interest in dealing with Hirsch since he considered this deal to be \u2018an extraordinarily remarkable one and one 92 which fits well into the sphere of our business undertakings\u2019. By March 1890 Deutsche Bank and Wiener Bankverein sent their delegates to Paris and negotiations with Hirsch had almost come to an end. The question if the two banks should ask the Ottoman Bank to participate right from the beginning in an 93 eventual deal with Hirsch was raised and presumably rejected because the Turkish government, fearing an ultimate gain of influence of the Ottoman Bank, 94 opposed it.

Finally on 17 April 1890 a group of banks, led by Deutsche and Wiener Bankverein, signed a contract in Brussels with Baron Hirsch through which they bought from him, for the moment, a quarter of the shares of the operat96 ing company (Betriebsgesellschaft) of the Oriental Railways obtaining at the same time an option for the remaining shares. Eventually this syndicate of banks acquired 88,000 shares out of a total of 100,000 representing the share capital of the Betriebsgesellschaft, i.e. all of those possessed by Hirsch himself, as well as all financial claims put forward by Hirsch vis-\u00e0-vis the Otto97 man government. How should this important amount of capital be managed? As we have seen above, it was Moriz Bauer who had, already in March, insisted with Georg Siemens on the creation of a \u2018trust company\u2019 as a viable solution for this problem. In mid-May he again urged Siemens who was planning a trip to Switzerland to consult about this matter with the heads of two important Swiss banks, Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (Cr\u00e9dit Suisse) in Zurich and Basler Bankverein, a forerunner of the later Union Bank of Switzerland. The trust company which would eventually be established would immediately take over all the shares and financial claims bought from Hirsch. It could afterwards be charged with other securities but it should, as a next step, increase its proper capital in order to be able to issue bonds with a sufficient guaran98 tee. This idea, developed by a banker like Bauer, contained the essence of what a well-known economist of those days, Robert Liefmann, called Effektensubstitution, i.e. the process by which securities of a company were substituted by the securities of another one. Fundamentally this was done for three reasons: (1) to achieve a better distribution of risk since the newly created holding company would normally hold securities of more than one firm; (2) to enable the financing of companies which were not yet capable of placing their own securities in the capital market (for instance, because their plants were still in construction and could thus not yet yield a profit); and (3) to exercise a control via such a holding without investing further capital.99\n20\n95\nIbid.

A New Financial Holding: Bank f\u00fcr Orientalische Eisenbahnen, Zurich On 1 October 1890 the Bank f\u00fcr orientalische Eisenbahnen held its first general assembly. The founders consisted of a group of banks, mainly from Germany, Austria and Switzerland: Deutsche Bank, Wiener Bankverein, Dresdner Bank, Deutsche Vereinsbank, W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank, 100 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, Basler Handelsbank, but also the Imperial Ottoman Bank. To this company, according to Liefmann \u2018the oldest and most important financial 101 holding established in Switzerland\u2019, a capital of 50 million francs in ordinary shares was assigned of which, however, only 20 per cent had been paid in. Besides, there were also 13 million francs of preferential shares. A few weeks afterwards the company issued bonds for 63 million francs, the statu102 tory upper limit corresponding exactly to nominal capital. The first securities taken over by the Bank f\u00fcr orientalische Eisenbahnen were of course the shares of the Betriebsgesellschaft, bought from Baron Hirsch: their nominal 103 value was 44 million francs out of a total capital of 50 million. This type of financial holding was, at least for continental Europe, quite an 104 innovation and as such it might be compared to the appearance of the new \u2018universal banks\u2019 and their forerunners, the Belgian Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and the French Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier, decades earlier. But why was Bank f\u00fcr orientalische Eisenbahnen (B.O.E.) founded in Switzerland? There were certainly advantages offered by the Swiss Obligationenrecht of 1881 which was less strict than the corresponding German law as far as the evaluation of participation or the legal responsabilities of the Vorstand and the Verwaltungsrat were concerned. Swiss companies could buy their proper shares if they wished to do so and further capital increases were permitted before the preceding ones had been completely paid in. Bonds could be issued without any upper limit whereas in Ger100\nDISCUSSION PAPERS\nSeidenzahl, F.

Schweizerischer Bankverein 1872\u20131972 (Basel, 1972), pp. 67\u201371). For the role of this new type of company in the international electrical industry from 1895 onwards cf Hertner, P. Les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s financi\u00e8res suisses et le d\u00e9veloppement de l\u2019industrie \u00e9lectrique jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la Premi\u00e8re Guerre Mondiale, in: Cardot, F.

Finally, taxes on securities were relatively low in Switzerland when compared to France or Germany.105 There were also concrete political reasons for choosing Switzerland \u2013 or Belgium \u2013 as host countries. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u20131871 these two neutral countries were the places where French and German capital could meet without being bothered, they became the turntables for international investment \u2013 Belgium until 1914 and Switzerland well beyond. Even if Deutsche Bank and Wiener Bankverein had godfathered the Bank f\u00fcr orientalische Eisenbahnen it was legally a Swiss company and its day-to-day administration, particularly bookkeeping and correspondence, was, by special contract, handed over to Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, a rather close ally of Deutsche Bank, which also administered its funds.106 The Swiss share in the Orientbank consortium amounted only to 6 per cent \u2013 the Austrian was 54 and the German 40 per cent \u2013 but the influence of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse on this particular holding was \u2018surprisingly large\u2019. Walter Adolf J\u00f6hr who has written an excellent history of this Zurich-based bank sees one of the reasons for this fact in B.O.E. being sort of a \u2018neutral instance\u2019 between the various interest groups present in this holding.107 Georg Siemens, in a letter to Moriz Bauer written shortly after the foundation of B.O.E., underlined the problems which were awaiting the new owners of the Oriental Railways: according to Karl Schrader, a former railway manager, actually a member of the German Reichstag and also a member of the supervisory board 108 of Deutsche Bank who had done most of the negotiations with Hirsch , the operating company of the Oriental Railways had suffered from contrasting interventions coming from its directors in Paris and in Constantinople. Unfortunately its relations with Bulgaria where its lines passed through were \u2018very bad\u2019, but its \u2018real enemies\u2019 were, according to Schrader, the Austrian and the Hungarian railway companies which showed no interest at all in favouring the traffic to Serbia and Bulgaria and wanted to divert it instead to Trieste and Fiume, nowadays 109 Rijeka. The growing self-assertiveness of the emerging Balkan states, Bulgaria first and Serbia later, was recognized very early by the leading staff of the railway company.

For that company was run from Vienna, had rate schedules and regulations outside their control and its higher personnel was foreign. The company was accused, justly or otherwise, of subordinating the interests of the countries which it traversed to its own financial iterests and to Austro-German economic interests and of making no effort to develop local resources and industry.111 All these problems made even some of Deutsche Bank\u2019s most reliable partners, for instance the leaders of W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank in Stuttgart, consider Siemens\u2019 engagement in the affair of Oriental Railways as 112 a \u2018folly\u2019. Parallel to its activities connected with the Oriental Railways, Deutsche Bank managed to get a concession for another railway line from the Sublime Porte in October 1890:113 this one provided for 219 kilometers of a line running from Salonica to Monastir, today\u2019s Bitola in the Republic of Macedonia, together with the claim to extend it to an Albanian port on the Adriatic Sea.114 The motive for establishing such a new line might have been that by running it through Turkish Macedonia and extending the line eventually up into Serbia the Oriental Railways \u2013 which were supposed to manage this additional network as well \u2013 would have been able to pass around Bulgaria\nDISCUSSION PAPERS\n110\nIbid.: von K\u00fchlmann to Siemens (23/10/1890). \u2013 As a matter of fact, until 1891 when the Bulgarian and the Oriental tariffs were unified, the tariff of the Betriebsgesellschaft of the Oriental Railways was higher than the Bulgarian one, and particularly so for local passenger transport. It was also clearly higher than the tariffs of the Prussian State Railways (Wei\u00df-Bartenstein, W. K. Bulgariens Verkehrspolitik und Verkehrswesen, in: Archiv f\u00fcr Eisenbahnwesen, 38 (1915), p. 1239). 111 Feis, H. Europe, the World\u2019s Banker, 1870\u20131914 [1st ed.

Kilian Steiner und die W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank (Ostfildern, 2003), p. 228, note 463. 113 The German Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt supported the request made by Deutsche Bank and its group to the Turkish government but it declined any responsibility in case of political unrest (BA, R 901/11975, f. 35: memo by Undersecretary of State count Berchem, March 12, 1890). 114 Helfferich, K. Georg von Siemens, vol. 3, p. 50; Gounaris, B. Steam over Macedonia, pp. 51\u201353.\n23\nwhich, at least for the moment, was considered to be the most difficult partner. In 1893 another concession was given to a group, headed by the Ottoman Bank and by Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas with the Frankfurt private banking house Bethmann as a third partner.115 This railway, called Chemin de fer Jonction Salonique \u2013 Constantinople, was supposed to run from Salonica eastward along the Aegean coast for 550 kilometers to Dedeagatch \u2013 its name today would be Alexandroupolis \u2013 where it would have joined the network of the Oriental Railways. The company started with a nominal capital of 15 million francs and the issue of 3 per cent bonds for an amount of 50 million francs.116 This line and the Salonica \u2013 Monastir line proved to be particularly useful to the Turkish army which could, as soon as these links had been finished, send large amounts of troops at short notice from the capital and from Anatolia to the European provinces of the Ottoman Empire, particularly to ever rebellious Macedonia.117 The \u2018Constantinople Junction railway\u2019, wrote the British correspondent William Miller in 1898, \u2018... enabled the Turks to strike hard and quickly at their foes\u2019.118 Judging by the annual reports and the data on transportation of passengers and merchandise the two decades between 1890 and 1909 were quite successful but, given the permanent unrest and the recurrent revolts in the European parts of the Ottoman Empire, traffic could not be compared to Western European standards. In 1903 for instance, there were violent revolts in 119 Macedonia and the Turkish Army had sent about 200,000 men there in order to crush the uprising. The report of the operating company for 1903 describes concomitant Macedonian terrorism in the following way:\nDP/4 DP/ 53/ 6/200 2 0 065\n115\n24\nStill in 1913 the Ottoman Bank owned 15 per cent of the capital of the Jonction railways (Thobie, J.

H\u00e4ufige Versuche der Sprengung wurden gegen unsere Eisenbahnlinien gemacht, gl\u00fccklicherweise meistens mit nur geringem Erfolge [...]. Mehrere Attentate wurden durch H\u00f6llen-maschinen gegen fahrende Eisenbahnz\u00fcge ver\u00fcbt, eine Anzahl Passagiere wurde get\u00f6tet oder 120 verletzt. [...]. Terrorist action of this kind became rather frequent in 1903\u20131904, as described here, and again in 1910\u20131911. \u2018These incidents occurred overwhelmingly in Ottoman Macedonia and Thrace ...\u2019, and the French-controlled Jonction Salonique \u2013 Constantinople line was also among the preferred targets of terrorism.121 Already in 1895\u20131896 B.O.E. enlarged its portfolio by acquiring ordinary and preferential shares of the Salonica \u2013 Monastir railway from Deutsche Bank. This purchase comprised 96.35 per cent of the entire nominal capital of 122 that railway company. Thus certainly an appreciated service was rendered to the financial status of Deutsche Bank although from June 1894 the line up to Monastir had been finished and profited from a payment of 14,300 francs per kilometer and year coming from the Ottoman government and guaranteed by the tithes of the Sanjaks of Salonica and Monastir, collected by the 123 Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt. After this purchase, B.O.E.\u2019s portfolio did not change for a decade. Only in 1905\u20131906 did it decide to buy shares of the Anatolian Railway for a nominal value of 7.5 million 124 francs. This was again a favour done to Deutsche Bank and its group which had to finance the continuous needs of this railway. On the other hand, Deutsche Bank and its group used B.O.E. for a compromise with the Imperial Ottoman Bank, concluded on 22 April 1905. It provided that each of the two partners would have to offer 25 per cent in any new business opened in Turkey. On top of that, the Ottoman Bank would reDISCUSSION PAPERS\n120\nBetriebsgesellschaft der Orientalischen Eisenbahnen. Vierunzwanzigste ordentliche Generalversammlung abgehalten in Wien am 31.

It does not seem that the Ottoman Bank ever took such participation but in 1907, in any case, one of the members of its Paris general committee entered B.O.E.\u2019s Verwaltungsrat.126 There was another regrouping of B.O.E.\u2019s portfolio in 1906 when half of the stock of the operating company (Betriebsgesellschaft der Orientalischen Eisenbahnen) was sold, with the help of its banking group, at the stock exchanges 127 of Zurich, Basel, Geneva, Berlin, Frankfurt and Vienna. By the end of 1906 even 45,240 of these shares \u2013 out of an original stock of 88,904 owned by B.O.E. 128 \u2013 had been sold. B.O.E. made a profit of 3.42 million francs out of this. Having wound up this sale, and again during the financial year 1906\u20131907, B.O.E. bought 37.5 per cent of the shares of the Harbour Company Haidar Pasha from 129 the Anatolian Railways. Also in this case it had looked after the interests of Deutsche Bank and its group. Until the beginning of 1907 only 30 per cent of B.O.E.\u2019s 50 million francs of nominal capital had been paid in. A general assembly then decided to fix its nominal capital at 40 million francs of which however 50 per cent had to be paid in. In the course of the same operation 50 million francs of 4 per cent 130 bonds were then changed into 30 million francs of 4.25 per cent bonds. In 1908 B.O.E. took over 94 per cent of the new shares issued by the Anatolian Railways \u2013 63.5 million francs of which it had to pay in, or just 10 per cent. 131 Most of it was earmarked for irrigation works in the plains of Konya.

The seizure was motivated by a strike of the local railway personnel133 which had been fomented by the Bulgarians.134 \u2018After the strike ended the [Bulgarian, P.H.] government declared its intention of retaining the line, asserting a willingness to indemnify the company, but not making clear where the necessary funds were to be found\u2019.135 In June 1909 the Turkish Government received a compensation of 42 million francs from the Bulgarians which had been \u2018furnished by the Russian Government\u2019.136 The operating company of the Oriental Railways was then compensated by the Turkish Government with a sum of 21.5 million francs for the losses incurred in the course of this seizure. From now on its network was reduced to a length of 954 kilometres.137 In 1910, the Anatolian Railways called another 10 per cent on their shares. B.O.E. met these needs by issuing another series of its 4.25 per cent bonds for an amount of 7.5 million francs.138 The B.O.E. report for 1910\u20131911 tells us that \u2018the company has been able to pay a dividend which varied between 5.5 and 6.5 per cent during a considerable number of years\u2019. \u2018Since one can expect an appropriate and stable return on our share capital also for the future, our banks \u2013 which have already participated in the foundation of our institute \u2013 thought this would be the moment for introducing the shares of the Bank f\u00fcr orientalische Eisenbahnen at the Swiss stock ex139 changes of Zurich, Basle and Geneva\u2019.

At the same time the company that had become Turkish remained under the control of its German and Austro-Hungarian shareholders, particularly the B.O.E., and received considerable compensation payments from the Turkish and the Bulgarian governments.140 The acquisition of almost 10,000 preferential shares of the Mersina \u2013 Tarsus \u2013 Adana Railway in 1910 was financially not important at all but it was probably justified by the overall strategy of Deutsche Bank in this area.141 The Italo-Turkish War of 1911\u20131912, but above all the two Balkan Wars of 1912\u20131913 did not only much harm to general railway traffic, they also blocked the operations of the now Turkish Compagnie d\u2019Exploitations des Chemins de fer Orientaux, and particularly in the areas occupied by the Serb, the Greek and the Bulgarian armies. By the end of the second Balkan War, in the summer of 1913, and due to huge territorial changes, 466 km of the Oriental network remained on Turkish soil, 85 km were now in Bulgaria, 77 km in the new Greek areas and not less than 371 km in Serbia\u2019s new territo142 ries. Whereas the Greek government showed itself disposed to a possible compromise, both the Serbian and the Bulgarian governments had occupied the lines of the Oriental Railways and operated them on their own responsability. In the end a solution could be found with Bulgaria but the problems with Serbia became chronic. During the entire period between the end of the Balkan conflict and the outbreak of the First World War, the Serbian administration showed almost no signs of willingness to come to an 143 agreement with the Compagnie d\u2019Exploitation. In April 1913, it accused the company of having concentrated, right from the beginning of the conflict, most of its wagons and locomotives in Salonica thus depriving Serbia of all of 144 its means of transport. Such a situation ought to be avoided in the future.\n140\nGutsche, W. Monopole, Staat und Expansion, p. 163. Ibid., p. 4, 22. 142 Gutsche, W.

M. Fragmente eines politischen Tagebuches. Die s\u00fcdslawische Frage und \u00d6sterreich-Ungarn vor dem Weltkrieg, ed. by J.

Both of them discouraged private investors, and the difficult relationship between the newly founded Bulgaria and the Oriental Railways has demonstrated this quite clearly. Thus the Serbian attitude in 1913\u2013 1914 is just another illustration of this general approach. From an economic point of view of course Michael Palairet is convincing when he states that the politics of nationalization of foreign-owned railway companies by both countries \u2018... merely burdened them with compensation payments which damaged their finances, and made it even more difficult to raise funds to build extension lines. ... [They] ... regarded the railway as a facility of the administration 146 rather than as a provider of economic services\u2019.\n3. The Austro-Hungarian Solution Given the really difficult situation which prevailed in the entire Balkan peninsula during and after the two wars of 1912\u20131913, it was quite a surprise when B.O.E. and Deutsche Bank managed, by the end of April 1913, to sell their shares of the Compagnie d\u2019Exploitation to a syndicate of Austro-Hungar147 ian banks . B.O.E. in its annual report for 1913 explains quite clearly how it saw the matter: according to these views there was little hope that an easy and quick understanding could be reached with the successor states to the Ottoman Empire. There would be too many chances that line operations would remain disturbed for a rather long time, in any case: for an incalculable period. Under these conditions it would be better to sell. The Saloniki \u2013 Monastir shares would be given away at a fixed price and the shares of the operating company of the Oriental Railways at a fixed price plus participation in eventual gains which would be realized in the future. The prices which would be paid now by the Austro-Hungarians were considered to be just adDISCUSSION PAPERS\n145\nCf the exchange of notes between the Serbian and the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Offices, in: OeStA, HHStA, Md\u00c4, AR, F 19, Karton 47, Fasz. 1. 146 Palairet, M.

Additional participation in future profits was, as we have seen, however, guaranteed. It should furthermore be accepted that one could now enjoy \u2018... the calm with which one might from now on observe the political events in the Balkan peninsula as a materially no longer really engaged observer\u2019.148 In another letter Deutsche Bank pointed out that this sale would enable them and their \u2018friends\u2019 to recuperate the capital invested in the European part of Turkey and to \u2018[...] liquify it in favour of our Asiatic railway enterprises, particularly the Baghdad railway\u2019.149 The buying group was led by the Wiener Bankverein, not really a newcomer to this scenario, and comprised furthermore two other big Viennese banks, 150 Anglo-Austrian Bank and Allgemeine Boden-Credit-Anstalt. On the Hungarian side figured Ungarische Allgemeine Creditbank, Pester Ungarische Commercial\u2013 Bank and Pester Erster Vaterl\u00e4ndischer Sparcassa-Verein. Each of the two groups got exactly 50 per cent. 51,000 shares of the Compagnie d\u2019Exploitation were on sale. Of these 45,000 came from B.O.E. and 6,000 from Deutsche Bank itself. The price was fixed at 52.45 million francs of which 17.5 million were to be paid 151 at a later date.

Cf also the arguments put forward in the meeting of the Council of Administration of B.O.E., held in Vienna on 16 April 1913 \u2013 the day of the agreement \u2013 where the sale was justified in the same way (HADB, OR 850). 149 Seidenzahl, F. 100 Jahre Deutsche Bank, p. 233. \u2013 Arthur von Gwinner who was then the leading manager of Deutsche Bank underlines this point of view also in his memoirs (Gwinner, A. von, Lebenserinnerungen, 2nd ed., ed. by Manfred Pohl (Frankfurt/Main, 1992), p. 85). 150 The Governor of Bodenkreditanstalt, Rudolf Sieghart, claims in his memoirs a leading role in this sale. According to him the idea of this transfer had been devised by Felix Somary who had been working until 1909 as an assistant manager to Karl Morawitz, head of the Viennese Anglo-Austrian Bank, and had then left Vienna for Berlin (Sieghart, R. Die letzten Jahrzehnte einer Gro\u00dfmacht. Menschen, V\u00f6lker, Probleme des Habsburger-Reichs (Berlin, 1932), p. 164). Somary confirms Sieghart in his own memoirs: \u2018[...] The Oriental Railways were of no interest for their yearly dividend payments but for Austria they were of the highest political value after the Balkan War had ended. I took an option on the majority of its shares and sold it to the Austrian and the Hungarian Governments\u2019 (Somary, F. Erinnerungen aus meinem Leben (Z\u00fcrich, 1959), p. 98). Sieghart\u2019s version is confirmed in the Tagesbericht of 19 November 1912 written by a high official of the Viennese Foreign Ministry, Ippen, who says explicitly that the idea came originally from Felix Somary and that his initiative had been \u2018probably the first step\u2019 (HHStA, Md\u00c4, AR F 23, Karton 105). The proof that somehow Sieghart and Somary told the truth lies in the fact that Somary claimed \u2018the fee which has been promised to me\u2019 in a letter to Helfferich on 17 May 1913 and that Deutsche Bank informed him through a letter of 20 June 1913 that a sum of 100,000 francs would be remitted on his account (HADB, OR 614). 151 GP, vol. 37/II, pp. 714\u2013715, document No. 15119.

The latter one was authorized to buy these shares at any moment and for a fair price but the banks could also sell to the Government whenever they desired to do so.152 One might suppose that Berchtold hoped to be able to put increasing pressure on the Serbian government once Austro-Hungarian banks had acquired control of this network. This proved to be a profound illusion, at least until the outbreak of the First World War in the following year changed everything. There were however contemporaries who recognized this problem as one can read in Der Oesterreichische Volkswirt, an authoritative Viennese economic journal, of 3 May 1913. The author of this article was convinced that the transaction had not so much been in the interest of this group of Austro-Hungarian banks but had much more been driven by the Viennese Foreign Office. He criticised the deal particularly from a political point of view since in his opinion it would embitter relations with the Balkan states. Either we live in peace with Serbia, then we will not need the shares [of the Oriental Railways, P.H.]. If we are in conflict with that country, then \u2013 with or without the shares \u2013 means of power will de153 cide, in the last instance the bayonets.\n152\nCf Kanitz-Wiesenburg, A.

Italy was particularly interested in the concession of a line joining Monastir with Valona or Durazzo on the Albanian coast, a concession which had originally been granted to Deutsche Bank 154 when it gained access to the Salonica \u2013 Monastir line. Otto Joel, leading manager of the Banca Commerciale Italiana, sent a telegramme to his friend count Hutten-Czapski in Berlin in which he urged him to ask the German government for a conference with Austria-Hungary and Italy on these railway matters before the Paris conference on financial issues of the Balkan states would have 155 started . This was one of the reasons why Joel travelled to Vienna a few days later where he reached a consent with the Austro-Hungarian government which 156 seemed to agree. A few months later, in the fall of 1913, a tentative attempt was made to get even French and, to a lesser extent, Russian capital into the Oriental Railways busi-\n31\nness, possibly on a fifty-fifty basis with the Austro-Hungarians because only thus, it was hoped, Serbian opposition could eventually be mitigated. As a by-product, much needed capital would flow from the ever resourceful Paris capital market to Austria-Hungary.157 The French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Pichon, in a discussion with the Russian ambassador to France emphasized the right which, according to his interpretation, Serbia had to nationalize the Oriental Railways on its territory but he pleaded nevertheless for another solution to this conflict by way of \u2018internationalizing\u2019 the Oriental network.158 Since the end of the First Balkan War, which means April 1913, a so-called syndicat d\u2019initiative had been formed by the well known French construction group R\u00e9gie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Chemins de Fer of count Vitali and the Paris private bank Gunzburg with Wilhelm von Adler, an ex-director of the Wiener Bankverein who had acquired an important position within the French Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, as counsel.159 By November 1913 the French group had prepared a project which consisted of the creation of two operating companies, one for the Serbian and one for the Greek net. In each of them either the Serbians or the Greeks should get one third of nominal capital. Another third was reserved for French and another one for Austro-Hungarian capital. Both companies would be controlled by a financial holding or, as it was called, une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de trust, organized according to French law and based in Paris. Within the holding French and Austro-Hungarian capital would have equal shares and an equal number of representatives. Its president would be a Frenchman.160\nDP/4 DP/ 53/ 6/200 2 0 065\n157\n32\nCf L\u00f6ding, D.

Aus den Geheimakten der Russischen Staatsarchive, vol. 3 (Berlin, 1926), pp. 318\u201319). 159 According to information gathered by the German ambassador in Vienna, von Tschirschky, von Adler or, as the French called him, d\u2019Adler, was not a French citizen \u2018... but in France he is considered to be a Frenchman. He lives in Paris, plays an important role in the French business world and enjoys at the same time the confidence of the Austrian business circles\u2019 (GP, vol. 37/ 2, p. 726, document No. 15131: von Tschirschky to Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg on 2 January 1914). Bernard Michel (Banques et banquiers en Autriche au d\u00e9but du 20e si\u00e8cle (Paris, 1976), p. 247) tells us that the French ambassador in Vienna, Dumaine, called von Adler in 1913 a \u2018financier cosmopolite\u2019 and comments then: \u2018Cette \u00e9tiquette un peu m\u00e9prisante [...] ne nous apprend rien, sinon la m\u00e9fiance des ambassadeurs pour les milieux financiers\u2019. Already in January 1913 von Adler had proposed a joint-venture composed of French and Austrian capital through the acquisition of the Western part of the Oriental Railway network. Such an initiative would \u2018 ... increase the guaranties that for the line to Salonica [...] no tariff policy could be realized against Austria and that existing stipulations would be respected scrupulously\u2019 (W. von Adler to Sektionschef Ritter von Wimmer of the Austrian Ministry of Finance on 4 January 1913, in: OeStA, HHStA, Md\u00c4, AR F 23, Karton 105). 160 SG AH, B 3180: \u2018proposition fran\u00e7aise pour la solution des questions de chemins de fer dans les nouveaux territoires serbes et grecs\u2019 (21/11/13).\nThe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, one of the big Parisian banques de d\u00e9p\u00f4ts was asked to collaborate,161 but this was a pure formality since Wilhelm von Adler, a close collaborator of this bank, had been one of the promoters of the project. At a later date the Greek and the Serbian governments would probably want to buy the networks situated on their soil. In this case the financial holding company would try to mobilize the necessary funds on the international, particularly the French capital market by issuing its own bonds. The sum required would be altogether around 80 million francs.162 Russia which considered Serbia to be part of its zone of influence would get participation in the French quota of the Serbian operating company.163 Italy, again represented by Otto Joel from Banca Commerciale, tried to stay also in this game but it asked only for subparticipation in the Austro-Hungarian quota. When the government in Vienna refused, the Italians wanted to ride with a French ticket.164 The Germans knew about the Franco-Austrian negotiations, and Deutsche Bank was not amused when it was informed that the Austro-Hungarian banking group would not want to hand them back the Eastern part of the Oriental network to which they thought to be entitled through the agreement of April 1913. The German side, and particularly Deutsche Bank, believed that the network in these European areas which after the Second Balkan War still belonged to the Ottoman Empire \u2013 more than 400 km \u2013 would in the meantime have become a valuable complement to the lines built through German initiative in the Asiatic 165 part of the Empire. The German government was equally against \u2018a total elimi166 nation of German influence on the Oriental Railways.\u2019 Already at the end of January 1914 the Secretary of State and head of the Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt von Jagow had declared to the Italian ambassador in Berlin, Bollati, that Germany was 161\nDISCUSSION PAPERS\nIbid.: a draft of a letter by R\u00e9gie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Chemins de Fer and the private banking house Gunzburg to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale of 25 November 1913. 162 Ibid.: Note sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 financi\u00e8re \u00e0 cr\u00e9er of 6 January 1914. 163 The Russian ambassador in Paris, Iswolski, to the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs on 23 November/6 December 1913 (Stieve, F.

Fragmente eines politischen Tagebuchs, p. 302).\n33\nagainst the internationalisation project and that it was making all sorts of efforts in order to make the Franco-Austrian compromise fail.167 The Serbian government, on the other hand, which still preferred the eventual nationalisation of the Oriental network in Serbia to the Franco-Austrian project of internationalisation, tried to gain time.168 169 In the very end, nothing came out of the Franco-Austrian project. Instead, an additional agreement was made between the German-Swiss group which had sold the 51,000 shares in the spring of 1913 and their Austro-Hungarian counterparts: the shares bought by the banks from Vienna and Budapest were to be blocked for a period of ten years and an ensuing sale to 170 foreign buyers could be vetoed by the Viennese government. This was a result not only of pressure exercised by the German government and Deutsche Bank and its group but it was also due to diverging opinions within the Austro-Hungarian government where particularly the Hungarian Prime 171 Minister Tisza was opposed to the internationalisation project.\n4. A Few Concluding Remarks Much more could be said on the entire topic, for instance about plans made since 1908 between France, Italy, Russia and Serbia to construct a railway line from the Danube to the Adriatic Sea or about Austrian plans to build a railway across the Sanjak of Novi Pazar.

One might conclude by saying that capitalism\u2019s irresistible march could well be interrupted and then delayed in some parts of Europe even by second-rate wars and conflicts and by relatively small states. If bankers in Berlin, Vienna, Zurich, Milan or Paris had ever forgotten this possibility, they were reminded of it when and if they were looking to the European South-East between the 1870s and 1914.\nDISCUSSION PAPERS\n35\nDP/4 DP/ 53/ 6/200 2 0 065\nReferences\n36\nAbleitinger, Alfred. \u00d6sterreichische Versuche um Zugang zum Pariser Finanzmarkt vor 1914, in: Kreissler, F\u00e9lix (ed.), Relations franco-autrichiennes 1870\u20131970.
