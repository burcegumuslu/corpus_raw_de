Healthy subjects - Healthy subjects as determined by absence of clinically significant deviation from normal in medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory determinations. eGFR \u2265 90 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 (according to Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] formula). Subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment - Subjects with confirmed liver cirrhosis by at least one of the following Criteria: histologically by prior liver biopsy showing cirrhosis, liver imaging (computer tomography, and/or ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance imaging scans, and/or fibroscan), or laparoscopy. - Child-Pugh Clinical Assessment Score 7 to 9 (moderate) or Score 10 to 15 (severe). Subjects with severe renal impairment - Subjects with severe renal impairment with an estimated glomerular filtration rate 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 according to MDRD formula. - Subjects with stable renal disease: no significant change in renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine value within \u00b125% from the last determination, obtained within at least 3 months before study entry and the absence of the need to start dialysis in the next 3 months.\nAll subjects - Active coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction within 6 months of study entry. Immuno-compromised subjects including known history/seropositivity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). - Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions (e.g. current diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus and with HbA1c >8.5%) that could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with protocol. - Previous or concurrent history of malignancies within 5 years prior to study treatment except for curatively treated cervical cancer in situ, non-melanoma skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer as well as localized prostate cancer. - Uncontrolled hypertension despite optimal medical management (per investigator\u2019s assessment). - Administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers within 2 weeks prior to dosing and during study conduct. (A list of these medications can be found in Section 16.6 of the protocol. However, this list may not be comprehensive). Subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment - Symptoms or history of encephalopathy (Grade III or worse) - Failure of any other major organ other than the liver; severe infection, or any clinically significant illness within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration - Renal failure with an eGFR <35 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 Subjects with severe renal impairment - Acute renal failure at study entry - Nephrotic syndrome - Failure of any other major organ other than the kidney - Acute hepatorenal syndrome\n|Studienstandorte|\nStudienstandorte\nCRS Clinical-Research-Services Kiel GmbH\nKiel, Germany, 24105\nContact Us:\nE-mail:\nPhone: (+) 1-888-8422937\nStudienstandorte\nInstitutul National de Boli Infectioase Prof.Dr.Matei Bals\nBucuresti, Romania, 021105\nContact Us:\nE-mail:\nPhone: (+) 1-888-8422937\nAn open-label non-randomized, phase 1 single dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of copanlisib in subjects with impaired hepatic or renal function in comparison to healthy subjects\nTrial Type:\nInterventional\nIntervention Type:\nDrug\nTrial Purpose:\nAndere\nAllocation:\nNon-randomized\nBlinding:\nN/A\nAssignment:\nParallel Assignment\nTrial Arms:\n4", "language": null, "image": "https://clinicaltrials.bayer.com/images/clinical_trials_explorer_logo.png", "pagetype": "website", "links": ["/", "/why-participate", "/#enhancingDiversity", "/what-are-clinical-trials", "/what-to-expect", "/transparency-policy", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=", "https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=", "/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#615e1214030b0402155c2300180413411215140518410e0f4122000f020413414c412e1509041347000c115a030e05185c28410b14121541070e140f05411509001541230018041341090012410041121514051841070e134111040e110d0441160815094122000f020413414c412e15090413445125445120380e144102000f410d0400130f410c0e130441031841020d08020a080f06410e0f41150904410d080f0a4103040d0e164f41", "https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/?term=NCT03172884&rank=1", "https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=2016-004561-51", "/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection", "/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection", "https://www.facebook.com/pharma.bayer/", "https://twitter.com/bayerpharma", "https://www.youtube.com/bayerpharma", "/terms-use", "/privacy-statement", "/contact-us", "/transparency-policy", "/sitemap"]}
