The major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, cerebral infarction, coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction threaten human life and health seriously and are caused by CAS. Therefore, early intervention in the formation of carotid atherosclerotic plaque and finding effective treatment methods after its formation are of great significance to prevent the occurrence of cerebrovascular diseases. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has constructed a variety of academic viewpoints in the clinical practice of treating CAS. At present, it is generally believed that toxin is an important pathological factor throughout the occurrence and development of CAS and the whole process of pathogenic changes. Toxic damage and collateral resistance are the basic pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Based on this, clinical doctors often use detoxification and dredging collaterals to treat this disease. At present, the commonly used TCM for detoxification and dredging collaterals can be divided into activating blood circulation, removing blood stasis, reducing phlegm, clearing heat, tonifying deficiency and so on. The main treatment method is removing phlegm, blood stasis and fire, while detoxification and dredging collaterals are regarded as the core of clinical treatment. Modern studies have shown that TCM for detoxification and dredging collaterals can intervene in the occurrence and development of CAS from multiple aspects. Its therapeutic mechanism mainly includes down-regulation of an inflammatory response, regulation of lipid, glucose, uric acid and other metabolisms, reduction of endothelial injury, improvement of hemodynamics, and inhibition of angiogenesis. At the same time, it was found in clinical practice that the indexes of CAS-related inflammatory factors, vascular endothelial injury, blood lipids, and vascular ultrasound-related arterial plaque parameters were significantly improved after the application of detoxification and dredging collaterals using Chinese herbal formula, which indicates that the intervention of detoxification and dredging collaterals in the pathogenesis of CAS has obvious therapeutic effects. In recent years, the efficacy of TCM for detoxification and dredging collaterals in the treatment of CAS has been more and more affirmed. Based on the background of the above research, this paper systematically evaluates the clinical efficacy of TCM for detoxification and dredging collaterals in the treatment of CAS by incorporating the clinical randomized controlled trials published in China and abroad, aiming to provide evidence-based medicine for its further clinical practice and promotion.\n[Systematic Evaluation of Chinese Herbal Medicine Detoxification and Dredging Collaterals in Treatment of Carotid Atherosclerosis, a Meta-Analysis Study [pdf 1.07 mb]](/obvumwhs/download/pdf/7922122?originalFilename=true)", "language": null, "image": "http://repositorium.meduniwien.ac.at/obvumwhs/download/webcache/304/8322833", "pagetype": "book", "links": ["#leftParts", "#centerParts", "https://www.ub.meduniwien.ac.at/", "/obvumwhs/", "/obvumwhs/doc/contact", "/action/changeLanguage?lang=en", "/UMW", "/search", "/obvumwhs", "/obvumwhs/content/thumbview/8322833", "/obvumwhs/content/pageview/8322833", null, "/obvumwhs/facet/type/nav/index/all", "/obvumwhs/nav/history", "/nav/index/title", "/nav/index/name", "/nav/cloud/keyword", "/nav/cloud/name", "/obvumwhs/wiki/students-info", "/obvumwhs/wiki/user-info", "/obvumwhs/wiki/imprint", "/obvumwhs/content/pageview/8322833", "/obvumwhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=bib.personalName%3D%22Zhang%2C%20Leyi%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvumw sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvumwhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=bib.personalName%3D%22Ma%2C%20Yan%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvumw sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvumwhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=(bib.originPlace%3D%22Wien%22)%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvumw sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvumwhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.date%3D%222022%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvumw sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvumwhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22detoxification%20and%20dredging%20collaterals%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvumw sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvumwhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22CAS%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvumw sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvumwhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22TCM%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvumw sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvumwhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22Chinese%20herbal%20formula%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvumw sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvumwhs/search?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.subject%3D%22systematic%20review%20and%20meta-analysis%22%20and%20vl.domain%3Dobvumw sortBy dc.title%2Fasc", "/obvumwhs/wiki/identifier/urnresolving?urn=urn:nbn:at:at-ubmuw:1-48219", "https://permalink.obvsg.at/UMW/AC16740573", "/obvumwhs/download/pdf/7922122?originalFilename=true", "/nav/classification/1592577", "/nav/classification/1592791", "/nav/classification/1592793", "/nav/classification/1592802", "/nav/classification/108912", "/nav/classification/109857", "/nav/classification/109934", "http://www.semantics.de/produkte/visual_library/"]}
