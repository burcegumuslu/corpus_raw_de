Your documents are now available to view.\nObjectiveA Journal of Physical Sciences: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Naturforschung A (ZNA) is an international scientific journal which publishes original research papers from all areas of experimental and theoretical physics. Authors are encouraged to pay particular attention to a clear exposition of their respective subject, addressing a wide readership. In accordance with the name of our journal, which means \u201cJournal for Natural Sciences\u201d, manuscripts submitted to ZNA should have a tangible connection to actual physical phenomena. In particular, we welcome experiment-oriented contributions.\nManuscripts considered for publication in A Journal of Physical Sciences: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Naturforschung A undergo high-level refereeing. Mere formal correctness of a paper is not sufficient for its acceptance. Moreover, articles reporting a merely marginal extension of already existing knowledge are considered unsatisfactory. Instead, the key quality a publication in A Journal of Physical Sciences: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Naturforschung A should possess is that it makes a genuine contribution to the advancement of its topic.\nArticle formatsOriginal research articles, research notes, letters and review articles from all areas of theoretical and experimental physics\nInformation on submission process", "language":
