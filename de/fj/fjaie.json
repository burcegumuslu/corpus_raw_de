Based on this material, monthly means of global radiation, \nair temperature and monthly sums of precipitation for the years 1978 to 1982 are discussed with \nrespect to their influence on shortwave radiation balance and sensible heat flux of Vernagtferner. \nAs the Albedo, which is derived from daily photographs of the glacier increases while global radi\u00ad\nation decreases during summer, shortwave radiation balance usually rises from May to August; \nthe lowest value was observed in June 1982 with 48 Wm-2, the highest one in August 1980 with \n96 W/m2. The Variation of sensible heat flux follows the change of air temperatures, as wind \nspeed does not vary much during summer. Meltwater production as calculated from the energy \nbalance, lies between 5 % and 30 % below the total measured runoff. \nENERGIEBILANZBERECHNUNGEN F\u00dcR EINEN 5-J A H RES-ZEITRAUM AUF DER \nGRUNDLAGE METEOROLOGISCHER MESSUNGEN AM \nVERNAGTFERNER/\u00d6TZTALER ALPEN \nZUSAMMENFASSUNG \nW\u00e4hrend der Monate Mai bis September werden an der Pegelstation Vernagtbach (2640 m \n\u00fc.

Escher-Vetter \n1. INTRODUCTION \nThe interrelationship between climate and glaciers has been a matter of great inter-\nest throughout the centuries. Only in this Century, however, has it become possible to \nobtain continuous, reliable records from more remote alpine, glacierized regions \n(Hoinkes 1964, 1968). The construction of the gauging Station \u201ePegelstation Vernagt-\nbach\" (2640 m a. s. 1.) in 1973 (Bergmann and Reinwarth 1976) provided a good oppor-\ntunity to record important meteorological parameters, such as global radiation, atmos-\npheric longwave radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind \nspeed and direction, at a site quite near Vernagtferner in the Oetztal Alps (46\u00b0 52' N, \n10\u00b0 49'E, 9.5 km2, 2740\u20143633 m). The albedo of Vernagtferner, probably the most \nsignificant of all the parameters affecting the energy balance of a glacier (Hoinkes \n1968, Wagner 1979, 1980), is documented by daily pictures of the distribution of ice, \nfirn or snow at the glacier surface, taken by two automatic cameras. By this means, we \nnow have continuous meteorological data for five ablation periods \u2014 1978 to 1982 \u2014 \nin the catchment of Vernagtferner. \n2. TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF GLOBAL RADIATION, AIR \nTEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION \nFig. 1 shows the monthly averages of global radiation in W/m2 for May to Septem\u00ad\nber (June to September in 1979). The largest variance occurs in September, with the \n1981 value less than half that of 1980. The highest value was recorded in June 1978, \n300 W/m2, whereas August 1982 displays the lowest of all five August values. Consid-\nering only global radiation, one would assume that 1978 was a year of high ablation, \nand 1982 of rather less melting on the glacier surface. \nFig. 2 shows the distribution of air temperature during the same period. Averaged \nover the five months and the five years, air temperature amounts to 4.1\u00b0 C. Precipita\u00ad\ntion (fig. 3) displays great variability, which is again highest in September. \nThe interaction of air temperature and precipitation can be critical to albedo \nvalues. Low air temperature and moderately high precipitation in August 1978, for \nexample, led to several spells of snowfall on the glacier, resulting in quite high albedo. \nIn August 1981, higher air temperature meant that a comparable amount of precipita\u00ad\ntion feil as rain, and the average albedo of the glacier remainded low, a Situation that \nwas well documented for Hintereisferner, in 1971 (Wagner 1979, 1980). \n3. SNOW-ICE DISTRIBUTION ON VERNAGTFERNER \nThe date when the first free ice is visible on the glacier surface (table 1) varies from \nthe beginning of June to nearly the end of July. This difference of about 8 weeks is \ncaused not only by winter accumulation but also by the type of precipitation during \nMay and June. The large difference in the extension of ice at the end of the ablation \nperiod between 1978 and 1982 (with nearly half the glacier area free of snow) is quite \nremarkable. Nevertheless, the effect of this large figure on albedo should not be over-\nestimated, since it is only the final value of the ablation season. The temporal develop-\nment of energy budget components is discussed in the following section.

SHORTWAVE RADIATION BALANCE AND SENSIBLE HEAT \nFLUX FOR THE TOTAL GLACIER SURFACE \nThe seasonal course of albedo dominates the shortwave radiation balance, and \nconsequently, the total energy balance. Given the relatively uniform structure of global \nradiation throughout the five seasons (fig. 1), the large effect of albedo distribution can \nbe seen quite easily in fig. 4 which shows absorbed shortwave radiation for the total \nglacier area. 1978, for example, had rather high global radiation values especially in \nJune and July. Nevertheless, due to the particular albedo values (fig. 5), shortwave \nradiation balance is quite small in these months, as the glacier surface did not consist \nof ice (with an albedo of 0.4), but firn (albedo 0.6) and, particularly in June, of fresh \nsnow (albedo 0.8). On the other hand, due to the large ice area, September 1982 has the \nhighest value of shortwave radiation balance in spite of its low value of global radia\u00ad\ntion. The highest shortwave radiation is reached in August 1980 with 96 W/m2, and the \nlowest in June 1982 with 48 W/m2. \nSensible heat flux (fig. 6) ranges between \u201440 W/m2 and +60 W/m2. In May, sen\u00ad\nsible heat flux is negative, i. e. no sensible heat is available for melting. Later in the \nyear, particularly in June, but also sometimes in July, sensible heat can amount to \nmonthly mean values half as high as those of shortwave radiation balance, for example \nin 1982. Generally, the sensible heat flux reflects the temperature distribution, as wind \nspeeds do not vary greatly during summer. \n5. ENERGY BALANCE OF THE ENTIRE GLACIER SURFACE AND \nRESULTING MELTWATER PRODUCTION \nThe energy balance of the total glacier is briefly discussed in the following. In the \nrestricted space available, it is not possible to go into any details of longwave radiation \nbalance or of latent heat flux (see Escher-Vetter 1980). \nFig. 7 shows the monthly means of energy balance as averaged over the entire area. \nTypically , the energy balance is negative and consequently no melting occurs in May, \neven in the lowest part of the glacier. Slightly higher energy balance values occur in \nJune, leading to some melting in the lower parts, although there is no melting in the \nupper reaches of the glacier. High values are recorded in July and August and reduced \nenergy balance values again in September. Within this overall pattern, only the July \nand August values can sometimes change order: in 1978, 1980 and 1981, energy bal\u00ad\nance rises from July to August, whereas in 1979 and 1982, it is much higher in July \nthan in August. The maximum of nearly 100 W/m2 was observed in July 1982 when Energy balance calculations at Vernagtferner, Oetztal Alps 401 \n1980 \n1982 Albedo \n1979 \n1978 \n1981 0.8-\n0.7 \n0.6 \nn s-\\ v^ 78 \n80 \n81 \n82 \nAugust Sept. \nFig. 4: Monthly means of shortwave radia-\ntion balance for 5 ablations periods 1978\u201482 \nfor the entire Vernagtferner May June July August Sept. \nFig. 5: Monthly means of albedo for 5 abla\u00ad\ntion periods 1978 \u2014 82 for the entire Ver\u00ad\nnagtferner \nFig. 6: Monthly means of sensible heat flux \nfor 5 ablation periods 1978 \u2014 82 for the entire \nVernagtferner August \nFig. 7: Monthly means of energy balance for \n5 ablation periods 1978\u201482 for the entire \nVernagtferner 402 H. Escher-Vetter \nshortwave radiation balance as well as sensible heat flux had extreme values. The min-\nimum July value occurred in 1979 with only about 30% of the 1982-value. \nAs the runoff from Vernagtferner is recorded continuously during the ablation \nperiod, it is possible to check both the overall meltwater production and the temporal \ndistribution of meltwater production, storage and runoff. Some of the results for 1979 \nhave already been discussed by Baker et al. (1982). Here, we confine ourselves to the \ncomparison of total sums of production and runoff. Meltwater production can be \nassessed in two ways, either from the energy balance, or by subtracting liquid precipi-\ntation over the entire catchment and runoff of the forefield (19% of the catchment \narea) from the runoff recorded at the gauging Station. The differences between these \ntwo values of meltwater are 29, 47, 10, 5 and 21 % for the years 1978\u201482, respectively. \nThe large difference of 1979 appears to be due to the overestimation of albedo after \nexceptional dust falls in the spring. The change of albedo required to make the two \nvalues match perfectly was \u20140.1, which again shows the extreme sensitivity of the \nenergy balance to albedo variations. \nWe therefore conclude that the meltwater production of an alpine glacier such as \nVernagtferner can be accurately calculated from energy balance measurements, pro-\nvided meteorological records from a nearby Station and continuous records of the gla\u00ad\ncier snow cover are available. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft within the framework of \nthe Sonderforschungsbereich 81, Teilprojekt AI of the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen.
