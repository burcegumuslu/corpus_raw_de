Ocean life provides coastal protection, contributes to human health and well-being, and supports cultural values, trade and tourism. The consequences of climate change are in particular seen in the high latitudes and altitudes. Hence, polar ocean and the cryosphere (including sea ice, glaciers, ice sheets, snow cover and permafrost as components) act as one of our planet\u2019s most efficient early warning systems for ongoing global warming and climate change.\nWhile 60% of the ocean remains beyond national jurisdiction, \nthe remaining 40% is in exclusive economic zones (EEZ) extend-ing 200 nautical miles seaward from the shores. The G7 states ac -\ncount for about one third of that area, including some of the most productive and diverse ocean realms. At the same time, these states are responsible for over one fifth of direct greenhouse gas emissions worldwide\n3 and an even larger share of historic emis -\nsions to date. Thus, the G7 states have a major responsibility for protecting the climate, the ocean and the polar regions.\nToday, the ocean and the cryosphere are changing faster than \never before due to anthropogenic climate change. To better protect the ocean and the cryosphere we need to understand, monitor, manage, predict and mitigate future changes and their impacts on human societies and ecosystems.\nIt is imperative that action is taken to restore balance in the \nmarine and polar systems. If action is not taken now, feedback processes will lead to irreversible and cascading effects on the global climate system.\n4\n1 IOC-UNESCO, 2020.

Both in Antarctica and Greenland, ice loss has strongly accelerated over the past decades.\n5 A source of growing scientific concern \nis the risk of crossing critical thresholds in ice sheet coverage if global warming exceeds 1.5\u00b0C, beyond which the current ice cover configuration would become unstable, and parts of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets might be irreversibly lost.\n6 The rate of sea level rise has more than doubled in the \nlast two decades. This is unprecedented. If emissions are not controlled, by 2100 the global mean sea level will rise by at least 1 m,\n7 and even higher in some regions. This threatens the \nexistence of unprotected shallow islands and coastal lowlands.\nOcean Change\nThe ocean plays a vital role in moderating contemporary human-induced climate change in absorbing about a quarter of anthropogenic CO\n2 emissions. The ocean is warming and \nhence may give rise to abrupt and irreversible changes, such as destabilisation of ocean circulation patterns with potentially important impacts on global heat and energy transport as well as on regional climate. Sea ice decline, acidification, changes in stratification and oxygen content come with serious impacts on marine life, its food webs and migration. Change is faster than processes of natural adaptation. Marine species are on the move as a result of climate change, with many species shifting poleward. The marine ecosystems are being massively reorganised. Hence, the Earth\u2019s biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem services are affected as a whole. \nPermafrost Thaw \nArctic permafrost is warming, and permafrost coasts are particularly vulnerable to rising air temperatures as rapid ground-ice melt and permafrost thawing accelerate coastal erosion. When sea ice declines, permafrost coasts are even more eroded by intensified wave action and storm surges. The reduced snow cover exposes the frozen ground to solar radia-tion for longer periods, accelerating permafrost thaw. Thawing permafrost promotes substantial microbial turnover of organic carbon and accelerates the emission of the greenhouse gases methane and CO\n2 from formerly frozen soils. Current \nestimates put the freeze-locked reservoir of organic carbon at 1,307 gigatonnes,\n8 which is 1.5 times larger than the current \namount of carbon in the atmosphere (860 gigatonnes). Thus, widespread and deep permafrost thaw holds great potential to amplify global warming by extensive future greenhouse gas release.Local and Global Impacts\nSea level rise already impacts people\u2019s livelihoods with the re-cession of shorelines and the increased frequency of flooding from storm surges, both leading to loss of coastal land and infrastructure, cultural heritage, natural resources and biodi-versity. If unabated, this will lead to cascading socio-economic impacts worldwide, including the disruption to livelihoods and displacement of hundreds of millions of people.\nNot only globally but also locally, the loss of ice has severe \nimpacts on humans: the shrinking cryosphere in the Arctic and high-mountain areas has led to predominantly negative impacts on biodiversity, food security, water resources, water quality, livelihoods, health and well-being. For example, sea ice decline drastically affects marine wildlife and thus indigenous culture and traditional hunting and fishing techniques in the North. Permafrost decline is destroying human and industrial infrastructures at an accelerating pace.\nCosts and benefits have been unequally distributed across \npopulations and regions. Thus, integrating scientific knowl-edge for risk assessments and solutions across the grand challenges of climate, marine and cryosphere connectivity at a global level is a pressing need.\n5 IPCC, 2019.\n6 IPCC, 2019.7 IPCC, 2021.8 Hugelius et al., 2014.

We call on the G7 governments to provide the following leadership:\n(1) Protect the ocean and the cryosphere by urgent and \nambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to \nachieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\u2022 Accelerate the worldwide just transition to carbon-\nfree societies to ensure substantive reductions in \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and that countries are on track to achieve their 2030 climate goals, and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.\n\u2022 Include climate change impacts, which may \nunfold over longer time scales but are already triggered now (e.g. sea level rise), in all policy and infrastructure considerations. \n\u2022 Include the ocean and the cryosphere in economic \nand environmental policies and ensure consistency with countries\u2019 climate targets. \n\u2022 Enhance international collaboration to protect the \nsensitive Arctic and Antarctic regions and ensure the sustainable management of living and mineral resources.\n(2) Strengthen the capacity of the ocean biosphere to \ncontribute to climate change mitigation. \n\u2022 Restore marine ecosystems and biological carbon \nsinks by effective conservation measures for marine \nlife as it plays a valuable role in global ocean health.\n\u2022 Significantly reduce emissions, pollution and \noveruse as a precondition for marine ecosystems and species to thrive, and for safeguarding their role in climate change mitigation and in providing coastal protection and food for humankind.\n\u2022 Establish more effective and equitably managed, \necologically representative and well-connected systems of marine protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures that cover at least 30% of the global ocean.(3) Engage all forms of knowledge. \n\u2022 Fund considerably more inclusive, international and \ninterdisciplinary research into the state of the ocean and the cryosphere, into ways of restoring their health, and into ways of adapting to changes in their state.\n\u2022 Halt and reverse biodiversity loss. Support the \nhealth and well-being of ecosystems. Develop innovative conservation and governance approaches based on sound environmental economics (including accounting for the damage and loss of biodiversity). \n\u2022 Co-design research and include indigenous \nknowledge in both natural and social sciences.\n(4) Enhance international scientific cooperation and \ndata sharing for an Earth observation and forecasting system.\n\u2022 Strengthen framework conditions for the \nadvancement of Earth system science and \nprediction by improving education and research, facilitating systemic approaches. Ensure continuous, effective and efficient observation of the ocean and the cryosphere. Provide access to areas within national jurisdiction, e.g. within the 200-mile exclusive economic zones (EEZ).\n\u2022 Increase international coordination, provide and \nshare adequate infrastructures and capacities, including data and models, for sustained observations of ocean and cryosphere, particularly in the polar regions.\n\u2022 Utilise advances in high performance computing \nand data science to address critical knowledge gaps. Build Earth observation systems and advance climate models through supercomputing to reach the scale of monitoring, forecasting and early-warning capabilities required to anticipate the specific consequences of climate change. International efforts are needed to coherently guide investments.\nScience7 Academies Statement 2022 31 Scienc e7 Academies Statement 2022Science7 Academies\nJeremy McNeil\nThe Royal Society \nof CanadaPatrick Flandrin\nAcad\u00e9mie des sciences \nFranceGerald Haug\nGerman National Academy \nof Sciences LeopoldinaRoberto Antonelli\nAccademia Nazionale dei Lincei \nItaly\nTakaaki Kajita\nScience Council \nof JapanSir Adrian Smith\nThe Royal Society \nUnited KingdomMarcia McNutt\nNational Academy of Sciences \nUnited States of America\nThe text of this work is licensed under the terms of the Creative Commons attribution License CC BY-ND 4.0. \nThe license is available at: https:/ /creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0 \nDOI: 10.26164/leopoldina_04_0053031 May 2022\n", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
