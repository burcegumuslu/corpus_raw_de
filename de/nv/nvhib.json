A literature search on \nnutrition and cancer leads to so-cal -led \u201ccancer diets\u201d - also known as \n\u201canti-cancer diets\u201d. These are special \ndiets that are intended to prevent can -\ncer (primary prevention), to support \nrecovery or to cure cancer (secondary \nand tertiary prevention). On the other \nhand, there is not yet any scientific \nproof that any cancer diet is effective \n[1\u20134]. Indeed, these diets can trigger \ncomplications or be harmful to health \n[1, 5, 6]. \nIn general, alternative and comple -\nmentary medicine - including special \nnutrition - are an important issue for \ncancer survivors [7]. It has been esti -\nmated in the international literature \nthat up to 75 % of patients may use \nthem [8]. In particular, breast can -\ncer patients require comprehensive \ninformation about nutrition during \nrehabilitation [9]. There is currently \nno information on how familiar pa -tients with breast cancer in rehabili -\ntation are with cancer diets, or how \noften they use them.\nQuestion\nThe aim of this survey of patients \nwith the diagnosis of breast cancer \nin rehabilitation was to record how \nmuch they knew about cancer diets \nand to list the sources or media they \nused to acquire information. It was \nalso investigated whether there are \ndifferences in sociodemographic and \nhealth-related characteristics bet -\nween patients familiar with cancer \ndiets and who have tried them, in \ncomparison to controls without this \nknowledge.\nMethods\n\u201cIndividuelle Nachsorge onkologi -\nscher Patienten\u201d1  (INOP study) is a \nprospective long-term study with \nrandomised controlled intervention \ngroups, including breast cancer \npatients with the diagnoses ICD-\n10 C50 (malignant tumour of the \nmammary gland), D05 (carcinoma \nin situ of the mammary gland) or \nC79.81 (secondary malignant tu -\nmour of the mammary gland). Summary\nThere is no scientific proof that so-called \u201ccancer diets\u201d are effective. 1,111 re -\nhabilitation patients with the diagnosis of breast cancer were surveyed. 16.6 % \nreported that they were familiar with at least one cancer diet and 2.0 % reported \nthat they had already tried out one of these diets. They had mostly heard about \ncancer diets from acquaintances or from the print media. In comparison with con -\ntrols, persons familiar with a cancer diet were more likely to have a higher school \nleaving certificate and to regard healthy nutrition as important. As acquaintances \nand print media were given as sources of information, it is important to focus on \nexplanation and transmission of current knowledge during rehabilitation.\nKeywords:  diet, cancer diet, breast cancer, rehabilitation\nCitation: \nExner AK, K\u00e4hnert H, Leibbrand \nB, Berg-Beckhoff G (2014) State \nof knowledge of breast cancer \npatients on cancer diets at the \nbeginning of medical rehabilita-\ntion.

In addition, a \nsigned informed consent form was \nprepared. The study participants \nwere consecutively recruited bet -\nween December 2009 and September \n2011 in five rehabilitation centres \nin Eastern Westphalia. They were \nreceiving medical rehabilitation, eit -\nher as follow-up treatment (59.5 %),  \nor as general therapy (40.5 %).  \nFor 69.8 % of the study partici -\npants, the diagnosis had been made \nwithin the previous twelve months. \nThe Ethics Committee of Westpha -\nlia-Lippe Medical Association and \nthe Faculty of Medicine of the West -\nphalia Wilhelms University M\u00fcnster \nchecked the ethical acceptability and \nthe data protection in the INOP study \nand gave its approval in January 2009 \n(File Number: 2008-439-f-S). \nFor the present cross-sectional ana -\nlysis, the data from the participants \nin the INOP study were collected in \nwriting at the start of their medi -\ncal rehabilitation, in the form of a \nwritten self-assessment. The data \nassessment considered the informa -\ntion provided by 1,111 study par -\nticipants (inclusion: n=1,184; res -\nponse: 93.8 %). \nThey were asked\n1.  whether they were familiar with \nso-called cancer diets, and, if so, \nwith which ones (free text ans -\nwer); \n2.  to what extent they had tried out \ncancer diets;  \n3.  which sources of information \nthey had used.\n \nEvaluation\nThe free text answers on the open \nquestions about familiarity and ex -\nperience with cancer diets were clas -\nsified by cancer diet, types of food \nand nutritional concepts. Using the \nx2-test, it was examined whether \nstudy participants differed from cont -\nrols with respect to sociodemographic \nand health-related characteristics.Results\nThe mean age of the subjects was \n59.5 \u00b1 10.5 years (range: 26 to 87 \nyears). \n184 (16.6 %) of the subjects were \nfamiliar with so-called cancer diets, \nincluding 22 subjects who had al -\nready used a cancer diet. Ten pati -\nents had used the \u201cbeetroot therapy \ndiet\u201d [10], four Dr. Coy's \u201canti-can -\ncer nutrition\u201d [11, 12] and one per -\nson the \u201ccancer cells don't like rasp-\nberries diet\u201d [13]. Other nutritional \nforms tried were: \u201ca lot of fruit \nand vegetables\u201d, \u201cdandelion\u201d, \u201csage \ntea\u201d, \u201cuse turmeric in cooking\u201d and \n\u201cvegetarian food\u201d. \nOf the 22 persons who had tried a \ncancer diet, 12 stated that most of \ntheir information came from ac -\nquaintances and 12 mostly from \nbooks (multiple entries possible). \n\u2022 Table 1 shows that subjects wi -\nthout knowledge of a cancer diet \npossessed on average a lower level \nof schooling than persons with this \nknowledge. Moreover, the question \n\u201cHow important is healthy nutri -\ntion to you?\u201d was answered with \n\u201cvery important\u201d by 74.3 % of sub -jects who stated that they were fa -\nmiliar with a cancer diet, but only \n62.6 % of controls. There were es -\nsentially no differences between the \ntwo groups with respect to body \nmass index ( x2-test: p = 0.400), age \ngroup ( x2-test: p = 0.779) or family \nstatus ( x2-test: p = 0.224) (data \nnot shown). \u2022 Figure 1 shows the \nsources of information used for the \nso-called cancer diets and \u2022 Figure 2 \nthe most frequently reported cancer \ndiets.\nDiscussion\nOne in six of the surveyed breast \ncancer patients stated that they had \nbelonged already of cancer diets, but \nonly 2 % stated that they had used \nthese diets themselves. This means \nthat only a few persons had occupied \nthemselves with special diets before \nmedical rehabilitation. It follows that \nmedical rehabilitation is a suitable oc -\ncasion to deal with the theme of can -\ncer and nutrition [14].\nBoth persons familiar with cancer \ndiets and those who had already used \nsuch a diet acquired most of their \ninformation from acquaintances, Information on knowledge  \nof cancer diet(s)\nx2-test\nyes no p\nn % n %\nSchool Leaving Certificate 182 904 <0.001\nNone / Elementary /  \nSecondary School69 37.9 498 55.1\nSecondary Modern School 66 36.3 261 28.9\nAdvanced technical certifica -\nte / A-Levels47 25.8 145 16.0\nImportance of Nutrition 183 922 0.002\nVery important 136 74.3 577 62.6\nImportant to not at  \nall important 47 25.7 345 37.4\nTab. 1:   Characteristics of breast cancer patients who are aware of cancer diet(s) \nand those who are not Science & Research  | Original Contribution114     Ernaehrungs Umschau  international  | 7/2014friends or relations (position 1) and \nbooks (positions 2). Both acquaintan -\nces, so-called guides and newspaper \narticles (position 3) give a generally \nuncritically positive view of specific \ndiets, often in layman's language [4]. \nThe participants only awarded the \nfourth position to the physician, al -\nthough he is normally regarded as \nthe patient's most important adviser \non cancer treatment. Possible prob -\nlems include inhibitions in physici -\nan-patient communication or lack of \nconfidence on the part of the patient \nthat the physician can answer open \nquestions correctly [15, 16]. Among the patients interviewed, the Internet \nplayed a subordinate role, which is \npartially to do with the participants' \nrelatively high age. This sequence \nof information sources is consistent \nwith published information [17].\nThe results can be taken to means \nthat persons with a higher level of \neducation are more likely to be inte -\nrested in the theme of cancer and nu -\ntrition. Patients actively search out \ninformation, in order to do something \nthemselves against the cancer \u2013 and \nnutrition is then an important theme \n[2, 18]. It is therefore comprehensible \nthat persons who consider that their nutrition is important are more li -\nkely to become aware of cancer diets \nor to study the issues. As cancer diets \nmay be linked to side effects or health \nproblems [1, 5, 6], persons interested \nin cancer diets require a great deal of \ninformation. For example, this may \nbe actively provided by dieticians in \nhealth facilities, such as rehabilitation \nclinics [19, 14]. In a review, H\u00fcbner  \net al. have listed 14 recommendations \nfor nutritional advice of cancer pati -\nents, in order to address the theme of \ncancer diets actively and to inform \npatients of the related risks [7].\nLimitations\nOne limitation in this survey was \nthat the question about cancer diets \nfamiliar to the subject already con -\ntained two examples (\u201ctotal cancer \ncure\u201d and \u201cbeetroot as medicine\u201d). \nSome of the subjects also specifically \nmentioned these. It is then unclear if \nthey were really aware of these, or \njust mentioned them because they \nwere already present in the questi -\nonnaire. It is also unclear for how \nlong and in which form the subjects \nimplemented the cancer diet(s).\nConclusion\nAs cancer patients often cannot \nFig. 1.

It is also \ngenerally important that medical \nstaff should discuss with cancer pa -\ntients how they might possibly help \nto improve their health. Nutrition is \nrecommended that is rich in fruit, \nvegetables and wholemeal, coupled \nto regular physical activity of at least \n150 minutes per week [20, 21]. \nThe patients should also be advised \nthat no effective cancer diet is known \nand that, in particular, they should \navoid selective diet forms. Finally, \nthey should be informed of suitable \nsources of information on the theme \n\u201cnutrition and cancer\u201d and these \nshould be discussed individually [9]. \nThis is the only way to guaran -\ntee that patients can think critically \nabout the theme \u201cnutrition and can -\ncer\u201d and with compliance with cancer \ndiets, so that they can consider their \nnutritional habits on this basis.\n \nM.Sc.
