This is my first time on this subreddit. I have achieved the Goethe B1 level, currently studying for B2. I would like to request some help regarding proper verb choice. I wanted to express the following sentence in german. \"That does not mean that i have overcome my nervousness, but nowadays i can deal with it better\" I have written \"Das bedeutet nicht, dass ich meine Nervoesitaet ueberwunden habe, aber heutzutage kann ich es besser behandeln.\" I am confused about whether to use Behandeln, Umgehen or Befassen. Normally i use Leo.org's online dictionary, or DeepL translator in order to get the proper verb choice, but i'm getting a little confused here. Really grateful for any help you could offer me.
