In contrast to normal cells, the glycoprotein profiles on epithelial tumor cells are distinctly altered. Incomplete formation of the glycan structures caused by down-regulation of glycosyltransferases and premature sialylation result in short saccharide side chains of the mucins and, thus, in the exposure of the peptide backbone. Additional epitopes become accessible to the immune system. These tumor-associated structure alterations constitute the basis for a strategy aiming at the selective immunological attack on cancer cells without affecting normal cells. In this strategy, it is essential to elicit a humoral immune response with synthetically defined glycopeptide epitopes and to avoid an autoimmune reaction. Therefore, the total synthesis of tumor associated glycopeptides is of importance for the development of antitumor vaccines. rnTumor associated carbohydrate based antigens are widely tolerated by the immune system. As a consequence, it is necessary to increase their immunogenicity by the use immune stimulating components. rnAccording to this concept, the present thesis shows methodologies and strategies for chemical synthesis and immunological evaluation of vaccine candidates. It is demonstrated that fully synthetic tumor-associated glycopeptides as partial structures of cell surface glycoproteins in combination with immune stimulating substances, e.g. carrier proteins or mitogens, elicit highly selective humoral immune responses. rnrn\n540 Chemistry and allied sciences\n[https://ror.org/023b0x485](https://ror.org/023b0x485) [http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-2073](http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-2073) [urn:nbn:de:hebis:77-31753](https://nbn-resolving.org/urn/resolver.pl?urn=nbn:de:hebis:77-31753) [https://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/](https://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/) [JGU-Publikationen](/handle/20.500.12030/2)\nDateien zu dieser Ressource:\n|Datei||Beschreibung||Gr\u00f6\u00dfe||Format|", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": null, "links": ["#content", "https://ub.uni-mainz.de", "#", "/mydspace", "/profile", "#", "/advanced-search", "/community-list", "/browse?type=author", "/browse?type=title", "/browse?type=dateissued", "/browse?type=dateavailable", "/browse?type=subject", "/browse?type=type", "/browse?type=department", "#", "https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/2075?locale=en", "https://openscience.ub.uni-mainz.de/handle/20.500.12030/2075?locale=de", "#", "/help-faq", "/help-research", "/help-faq-search", "/help-publish", "https://www.ub.uni-mainz.de/de/dissertationen", "/contact", "/", "/handle/20.500.12030/1", "/handle/20.500.12030/2", "/browse?type=author&value=Kaiser%2C+Anton", "https://ror.org/023b0x485", "http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-2073", "https://nbn-resolving.org/urn/resolver.pl?urn=nbn:de:hebis:77-31753", "https://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/", "/handle/20.500.12030/2", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/2075/1/3175.pdf", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/2075/1/3175.pdf", "/bitstream/20.500.12030/2075/1/3175.pdf", "/handle/20.500.12030/2075?mode=full", "/handle/20.500.12030/2075/statistics", "/imprint", "/privacy", "/contact", "/guidelines", "https://doi.org/10.18452/24678", "https://www.uni-mainz.de/"]}
