The goal of the Focus Program Translational Neurosciences (FTN) is to bundle together the strengths of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, including the University of Medicine, and to rigorously promote support for the scientists of tomorrow. In order to achieve these goals, the FTN pursues a variety of connected activities and is currently in the process of obtaining its own research facilities.", "language": null, "image": null,
