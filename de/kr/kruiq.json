In track 1-Path to a Tranquil Pond Body Relaxation-you will be guided through a vivid visualization, accompanied by soothing music and 3-D sound effects. As you walk along sand dunes and marsh grass to a tranquil pond near the sea, your body will become relaxed, one part at a time, until you are in a theta-level meditative state and receptive to suggestions. Next, in track 2-Mind-Programming Suggestions& Visualizations-you will hear a series of impactful statements worded for maximum subconscious acceptance. You will also mentally recite tranquility-themed mantras, practice projecting your own mental movie in which you accomplish your relaxation goals, and receive these key trigger words for your postmeditative conditioned response: \"inner peace.\" In track 3-Symbol Therapy-additional positive messaging will be relayed to you, this time as successive guided visualizations coupled with more repeated suggestions. Your visualization journey then resumes in track 4-The Visitor-when a guardian angel or guide will appear to deliver tips on how to accomplish your goals, once again anchored by positive programming. Finally, in track 5-Awakening-you will be brought back to beta consciousness; and in track 6-Beta-Talk Subconscious Reinforcement-you will program your subconscious mind while wide-awake, repeating affirmations to take with you in daily life. In this way, the meditative suggestions will continue to be reinforced through this incredibly powerful process.", "sitename": "Sch\u00f6nstatt-Verlag", "date": "2021-11-02", "id": null, "license": null, "body": null, "comments": "", "commentsbody": null, "raw_text": null, "text": "Beschreibung\nPROGRAM YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS& SUPERCONSCIOUS MINDS FOR PEACE\nDetach from chaos and remain relaxed and at ease with this in-depth, six-part meditation using relaxation induction, creative visualization, and hypnotic suggestion techniques.\nIn track 1-Path to a Tranquil Pond Body Relaxation-you will be guided through a vivid visualization, accompanied by soothing music and 3-D sound effects.

He began his career offering his metaphysical seminars in the late 1960s around Phoenix, Scottsdale, and Sedona, Arizona, and since then over 250,000 people have attended one of his Sutphen Seminars, retreats, or workshops. He authored 25 books, including the million-copy bestseller You Were Born Again to Be Together, and he was the first person to put hypnosis programming on audio for sale, creating over 900 audio products between 1976 and 2011. Dick appeared on hundreds of radio and television shows, including the Phil Donahue Show, Good Morning America, and Tom Snyder's Tomorrow Showwhere he conducted the first televised past-life regression. He also spoke regularly at festivals and professional organizations, bringing his wisdom to hundreds of thousands of faithful followers of his works. A leader in the field of hypnosis, Dick was honored with many awards throughout his career, including an honorary lifetime membership to the International Hypnosis Federation and the Lifetime Achievement Humanitarian Award presented by the Hypnotherapy Academy in May 2019. Dick passed away on September 1, 2020, and is survived by his wife, Roberta, and their Lhasa apso puppies.", "language": null, "image":
