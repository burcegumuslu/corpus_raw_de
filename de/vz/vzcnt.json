Design:\nRandomized controlled multicenter trials with three treat-ment arms and a total observation period of 28 weeks. Set-\nting: 30 practitioners and outpatient units in Germany spe-\ncialized in acupuncture treatment. Patients: Per study 300\npatients with migraine and episodic or chronic tension-typeheadache, respectively (diagnosis according to the criteriaof the International Headache Society). Interventions: Pa-\ntients are randomly assigned to receive either (1) semi-stan-dardized acupuncture (150 patients), (2) standardized mini-mal acupuncture (75 patients), or (3) no interval treatmentfor 12 weeks followed by semi-standardized acupuncture(75 patients, waiting list control). Acupuncture treatmentconsists of 12 sessions per patient over a period of 8 weeks.Main Outcome Measure: Main outcome measure in the mi-\ngraine trial is the difference between the number of dayswith headache of moderate or severe intensity during the 4weeks before randomization and weeks 9 to 12 after ran-domization. In the study on tension-type headache the mainoutcome measure is similar to that described above, but forthe number of headache days regardless of intensity. Out-\nlook: The results of these two studies (available in 2004) will\nprovide health care providers and policy makers with the in-formation needed to make scientifically sound assessmentsof acupuncture therapy.Schl\u00fcsselw\u00f6rter\nAkupunktur \u00b7 Randomisierte klinische Studie \u00b7 Migr\u00e4ne \u00b7Spannungskopfschmerz\nZusammenfassung\nHintergrund und Ziel: Der vorliegende Artikel beschreibt\nDesign und essentielle Teile der Protokolle zweier randomi-sierter Studien (\u00abAcupuncture Randomized Trials\u00bb = ART),deren Ziel es ist, zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen, ob eine Akupunkturbehand-lung bei der prophylaktischen Behandlung von Migr\u00e4nebzw.

Under in-creasing pressure to cut health care costs, however, the Feder-al Committee of Physicians and Health Insurers (\u2018Bundes-ausschuss der \u00c4rzte und Krankenkassen\u2019) decided in October2000 that the scientific evidence supporting acupuncture wasinsufficient to justify routine reimbursement. Nevertheless, itrecommended that special Model Projects on Acupuncture(\u2018Modellvorhaben Akupunktur\u2019) be developed in order to de-termine the role of acupuncture in the treatment of certain ill-nesses. In particular, the Committee requested that \u2018sham\u2019-controlled, randomized clinical trials be conducted on the roleof acupuncture in the management of chronic headache,chronic low back pain, and chronic pain associated with os-teoarthritis [1] \u2013 all conditions for which the available evi-dence had shown acupuncture to be a promising means oftreatment. Today, the costs of acupuncture therapy can becovered by the health insurance funds for a limited period oftime on a nation-wide level, provided that the treatment beadministered within the framework of Model Projects whichalso include \u2018sham\u2019-controlled, randomized trials as part of theevaluation strategy.In this paper, we report on the design and protocols of twosuch clinical trials for migraine and tension-type headache,which are part of larger acupuncture research programs (the\u2018Modellvorhaben der Ersatzkassen\u2019 and the \u2018Modellvorhaben\nder Techniker Krankenkasse und der dem Modellvorhabenbeigetretenen Krankenkassen\u2019). Following commonly recom-mended standards for headache research [2, 3], these trials in-vestigate whether a semi-standardized acupuncture interven-tion is more efficacious than 1) no treatment and 2) a stan-dardized minimal acupuncture intervention in the intervaltreatment of patients with migraine and tension-typeheadache, respectively. In another, separate paper [4], we pre-sent details on clinical trials that examine the role of acupunc-ture in the management of chronic low back pain and os-teoarthritis of the knee.\nState of Research on Acupuncture for Headache\nA systematic review published in 2001 [5] identified 26 ran-domized controlled trials of acupuncture for the interval treat-ment of chronic headaches. Sixteen trials were conductedamong migraine patients, 6 among patients with tension-typeheadache, and 4 among patients with various headaches. Six-teen trials compared acupuncture with a sham intervention,10 with other treatments. Overall, the results suggest thatacupuncture is more efficacious than sham interventions inmigraine. For tension-type headache and the comparison ofacupuncture with other treatments the number of trials is toosmall for reliable conclusions. Other limitations of these trialsincluded small patient groups (median sample size 37), singlesite performance, and relevant methodological and/or report-ing shortcomings [5].

Patients are blinded to treatment in the acupunc-ture and minimal acupuncture arms of the studies. Analysis of headachediaries will be performed by two blinded evaluators. The total observationperiod within the study is 28 weeks per patient. Before randomization pa-tients enter a 4-week baseline period. After randomization, patients inthe acupuncture and in the minimal acupuncture group receive 12 treat-ments over a period of 8 weeks; patients in the waiting list group do notreceive any prophylactic headache treatment for 12 weeks. All patientsare asked to document their headaches both in the baseline period and for12 weeks after randomization. Additionally, patients in the acupunctureand in the minimal acupuncture group have to continue their headache di-aries in the weeks 21 to 24 after randomization. After 12 weeks withoutprophylactic treatment, patients in the waiting list group receive 12acupuncture treatments within 8 weeks and fill in headache diaries duringthese 8 and the following 4 weeks.Randomization into the 3 study arms is performed centrally by the Insti-tute of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology (IMSE) at the TechnischeUniversit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen using the software Samp Size 2.0 [12]. Participatingpractitioners and outpatient units are not involved in the randomizationprocess. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and give written and oralconsent are included in the study. After a patient is included in the study,his or her physician phones IMSE, where the patient is registered. Thenthe physician receives information from the IMSE regarding patient allo-cation both via phone and fax. This procedure assures that randomizationcannot be influenced by the treating physicians.The studies are performed according to the principles of the Declaration\nof Helsinki (Version Edinburgh 2000, cf. \nhttp://www.wits.ac.za/bioethics/\nhelsinki.htm ) and according to common guidelines for clinical trials\n(ICH-GCP). The protocols have been approved by local ethics reviewboards in all regions where the study is being conducted. The study parti-cipants are insured according to the German law for medicinal products(\u2018Medizinproduktegesetz\u2019).\nPatients\nEach study aims to recruit a total of 300 patients. Recruitment for the tri-als started in April 2002.For inclusion into either study the following general criteria have to be\nmet: age 18\u201365 years; duration of complaints at least 12 months; completebaseline headache diary; written informed consent. General exclusion cri-teria are: secondary headaches; start of headaches after age of 50 years;use of analgesics on more than 10 days per month; prophylactic headachetreatment with drugs during the last 4 weeks; any acupuncture treatmentduring the last 12 months or at any time if performed by the participatingtrial physician; blood coagulation disorders or coagulation-inhibiting med-ication other than acetyl-salicylic acid; relevant organic or mental disor-ders; pregnant or lactating women; application for pension or disabilitybenefits; alcohol or drug abuse; any research study participation duringthe last 6 months; inability to understand the study.Specific inclusion criteria for the migraine trial are: a diagnosis of mi-graine with or without aura according to the criteria of the InternationalHeadache Society, 2 to 8 migraine attacks per month during the last 3months and during the baseline period. Specific exclusion criteria: intervalheadaches or additional tension-type headache on more than 10 days permonth, and inability to differentiate migraine and interval headaches.Specific inclusion criteria for the tension-type headache trial are: a diag-\nnosis of episodic or chronic tension-type headache according to the crite-ria of the International Headache Society, at least 8 headache days permonth in the last 3 months and in the baseline period. Specific exclusioncriterion: additional migraine attacks.All patients are asked to complete the Kiel Headache Questionnaire [13]which has been designed to separate migraine, tension-type and otherheadaches. Furthermore, the Mainz Classification Scheme (\u2018Mainzer Sta-dieneinteilung\u2019) [14] is used. This is a physician-based questionnaire toclassify the degree of chronicity in pain patients.\nParticipating Physicians\nParticipating trial physicians were recruited in a manner designed to en-sure that their qualification is at least equal to the average qualification ofphysicians currently accredited for providing acupuncture in the German\u2018Modellvorhaben Akupunktur\u2019. Physicians were thus required to fulfil allof the following criteria: (1) acupuncture training at least equivalent to an\u2018A-diploma\u2019 from one of the major German acupuncture societies (140\nhours of acupuncture training); (2) 50% of trial physicians had to have atleast a \u2018B-diploma\u2019 (350 hours; about 20% of physicians accredited to pro-vide acupuncture as part of the \u2018Modellvorhaben Akupunktur\u2019 and out-side the trials have this qualification [15]); (3) 50% had to have experienceworking in clinical studies; (4) all physicians had to have at least 3 years ofpractical experience with acupuncture; (5) all physicians had to participatein study training sessions on the trial methods, the interventions tested,and standards for performing clinical trials (ICH-GCP). About 30 studycenters are currently participating in the studies. Non-medical acupunc-turists were excluded from the studies.\nInterventions\nThe treatment strategies for acupuncture and minimal acupuncture were\ndeveloped in a consensus process with experienced acupuncture experts(Hammes M, Hummelsberger J, Irnich D) representing the following twomajor German societies for medical acupuncture: German MedicalAcupuncture Association (\u2018Deutsche \u00c4rztegesellschaft f\u00fcr Akupunktur\u2019,D\u00c4GfA); International Society for Chinese Medicine (Societas Medici-nae Sinensis, SMS). In a first step the three experts developed a proposalwhich was then presented to more than 30 experts from both acupuncturesocieties for discussion. The final strategies were defined by the three ex-perts together with the study team and communicated to the external ad-visors. The final strategies were generally considered as a pragmatic com-promise between the need for some standardization and the need for in-dividualization. Both the acupuncture and minimal acupuncture treatments consist of 12sessions of 30 min duration, each administered over a period of 8 weeks(preferably 2 sessions in each of the first 4 weeks, followed by 1 sessionper week in the remaining 4 weeks). Patients in the waiting list group donot receive acupuncture treatment for a period of 12 weeks after random-ization, after which they receive the acupuncture treatment describedbelow.Acupuncture treatment is semi-standardized (tables 1, 2): All patientshave to be treated at \u2018basic\u2019 points bilaterally unless there are contra-indi-cations. In addition, physicians can treat at other points based on a tradi-tional Chinese syndrome diagnosis, personal experience, localisation ofpain or symptom modalities. Recommendations of additional points (uni-or bilaterally) are made, but acupuncturists can choose other optionalpoints (including ear acupuncture points or trigger points). The numberand name of additional acupuncture points must be documented. A tradi-tional Chinese syndrome diagnosis is requested, but not mandatory. If it isperformed, the diagnosis must be documented. Needle length and diame-ter are not predefined but have to be documented. An irradiatingneedling sensation (\u2018de qi\u2019) should be achieved if possible. Needles shouldbe stimulated manually at least once in each session. The total number ofneedles must not exceed 25.182 Forsch Komplement\u00e4rmed Klass Naturheilkd\n2003;10:179\u2013184Melchart/Linde/Streng/Reitmayr/Hoppe/\nBrinkhaus/Becker-Witt/Wagenpfeil/Pfaffenrath/Hammes/Willich/WeidenhammerNumber, duration and frequency of the sessions in the minimal acupunc-ture group are the same as for the acupuncture group. In each session atleast 5 out of 10 points (table 3) have to be acupunctured bilaterally (atleast 10 needles). Superficial insertion using fine needles (20\u201340 mm inlength) is recommended. \u2018De qi\u2019 and manual stimulation of the needlesshould be avoided; the needles should be placed subcutaneously. Allacupuncturists were trained to apply minimal acupuncture and received avideotape and a brochure showing detailed information on minimalacupuncture.Patients in the waiting list control group do not receive any prophylactictreatment for their headaches for a period of 12 weeks after randomiza-tion. After that period they receive the acupuncture treatment describedabove.All patients can treat acute headaches as needed. Attack treatmentshould be performed according to the guidelines of the German Migraineand Headache Society (DMKG) [16, 17]. Mild migraine attacks and ten-sion-type headaches can be treated with acetyl-salicylic acid, naproxen,paracetamol, or ibuprofen orally. Severe migraine attacks can be treatedwith sumatriptan orally or subcutaneously, another triptan, or with ergot-amine tatrate. Tension-type headache may also be treated by topical pep-\npermint oil. Antiemetics can be used if needed. Non-drug interventions(such as relaxation) can be maintained if already used since at least 3months. Attack treatment must not be modified after the baseline period.All drugs taken for acute headaches have to be documented in theheadache diary.Patients are informed in respect to acupuncture and minimal acupuncturein the study as follows: \u2018In this study, different types of acupuncture willbe compared. One type is similar to the acupuncture treatment used inChina. The other type does not follow these principles, but has also beenassociated with positive outcomes in clinical studies.\u2019\nOutcome Measurement\nAll patients fill in headache diaries in the 4 weeks before randomization,the 12 weeks after randomization, and in the weeks 21 to 24 after rando-mization (fig. 1). In the diaries they document each day whether or notthey have headache and, if it does occur, they describe its duration, inten-sity, laterality, disability, concomitant symptoms, and medication used. Inaddition, patients are asked to fill in a modified version of the pain ques-tionnaire of the German Society for the Study of Pain (DGSS;http://www.medizin.uni-koeln.de/projekte/dgss/Schmerzfragebogen.html)before treatment, after 12 weeks, and after 24 weeks. In addition to anumber of questions on sociodemographic characteristics, numerical ra-ting scales for pain intensity, questions on workdays lost, global assess-ments, etc., the DGSS pain questionnaire includes the following validatedinstruments: 1) the German version of the Pain Disability Index (PDI)[18]; 2) a scale for assessing emotional aspects of pain (\u2018Schmerzempfin-dungs-Skala\u2019 SES) [19]; 3) the depression scale ADS [20]; 4) the Germanversion of the SF-36 to assess health-related quality of life [21].Main outcome measure in the migraine trial is the difference in number ofdays with headache of moderate or severe intensity in the 4 weeks beforerandomization and in weeks 9 to 12 after randomization. In the tension-type headache trial the main outcome measure is similar but compares thenumber of headache days regardless of intensity. Secondary outcomemeasures derived from the headache diaries include: Headache days (ofmoderate or severe intensity as well as regardless of intensity) and theirdifferences to baseline during weeks 1 to 4, 5 to 8, and 21 to 24 after ran-domization, headache hours in 4-week periods, headache scores, meanpain intensity, number of days with accompanying symptoms, days withimpaired function, days with medication, and number of responders (atleast 50% reduction in the main outcome measure).

Acupuncture points used in the tension-type headache trial(at least 50% reduction in migraine days and attacks) will also be evaluat-\ned. Further secondary outcome measures are the changes in the items andscales included in the pain questionnaires.In order to test the blinding to treatment, patients fill in a questionnaireafter the third acupuncture session to assess the credibility of the respec-tive treatment methods [22]. At the end of the study, patients are askedwhether they think that they have received acupuncture following theprinciples of Chinese medicine or the other type of acupuncture. For eachsession, physicians are asked to report whether side effects or adverse ef-fects occur. In addition, the patients are asked to report side effects in theabove-mentioned questionnaires both at the end of 12 and 24 weeks afterrandomization (fig. 1). Drop-outs and withdrawals and the respective rea-sons are documented.\nStatistics\nAnalyses will be performed for two populations: 1) an intention to treatpopulation with all patients randomized (missing data will be replacedwith baseline values); 2) a per protocol population including only patientswithout major protocol deviations. All data will be analyzed descriptively.Confirmatory testing of the main outcome measure and all main analyseswill be based on the intention to treat population. A priori ordered one-sided (due to the available evidence suggesting a positive effect [5]) nullhypotheses to be tested are H\n0,1: acupuncture = waiting list, H 0,2:\nacupuncture = minimal acupuncture. For each hypothesis Student\u2019s t-testand \u03b1= 5% will be used, thus testing in a first step whether acupuncture is\nmore efficacious than no treatment, and in a second step whetheracupuncture is more efficacious than minimal acupuncture. The studiesare powered to detect a difference of 2 days with moderate or severeheadache with a standard deviation of 5 days (thus an effect size of 0.4)with 80% power. The waiting list control group will be included in themain analysis only until week 12 after randomization.\nDiscussion\nTogether with studies in other \u2018Modellvorhaben Akupunktur\u2019\n[23] (model projects on acupuncture) the planned trials de-scribed in this and the following paper [4] are likely to have amajor impact on the decision whether acupuncture will be re-imbursed by social health insurance companies in Germany.Compared with most trials of acupuncture currently available[24] our studies are performed with a much larger number ofacupuncturists and include a much larger number of patients.The Federal Committee of Physicians and Health Insurers in\nGermany has requested reports on results of these studies inJanuary 2004. By this date a final report on the migraine trial\nshould be available, and the results of the study in tension-type headache patients will be available later that year.A major issue in the planning phase of the studies presentedhere and in the following paper [4] was the choice of controlgroups. The Federal Committee has explicitly asked that thetrials include \u2018sham\u2019 or \u2018placebo\u2019 controls to investigatewhether the effects of acupuncture are \u2018specific\u2019. However,the concepts of placebo, and its specific and unspecific effectsin relation to complex physical interventions such as acupunc-ture are unclear. How is \u2018specific\u2019 defined in relation toacupuncture? Do only the effects due to correct localization ofpoints have an influence, or do other aspects such as skin pen-etration, correct insertion depth, triggering of \u2018de qi\u2019, stimula-tion, number, frequency and duration of sessions also play apart? We have performed a systematic review (submitted for\npublication) of sham-controlled trials of acupuncture. Similarto an older review of the topic [25] we found that a multiplici-ty of different sham techniques are used and that the differ-ences between \u2018true\u2019 and \u2018sham\u2019 interventions vary greatly be-tween studies. This might explain in part the obvious hetero-geneity of results between different acupuncture trials [24].We decided to use a \u2018minimal\u2019 acupuncture [26] intervention\nas control which differs from the \u2018full\u2019 acupuncture interven-tion in point location, needling depth, avoidance of \u2018de qi\u2019 andof manual stimulation. Similar interventions have been usedin a variety of trials [24]. As this trial is aimed to help in thedecision process whether acupuncture should be reimbursed,a pragmatic comparison between an acupuncture \u2018lege artis\u2019and a form which is clearly suboptimal according to acupunc-ture theory seems adequate. For example, we decided not touse \u2018placebo\u2019 needles [27] for practical (difficult to use in hairyareas, at the head, hands and feet; costs; handling in a multi-center trial) and conceptual reasons (much more physician-patient contact than in routine practice). Furthermore, it is un-clear whether placebo needles should be used at the correctsite (testing only whether skin penetration makes a differ-ence) or at incorrect sites (testing skin penetration and local-ization). To quantify the \u2018unspecific\u2019 effects of minimalacupuncture we included a waiting list control group. We deliberately avoid the expressions \u2018placebo\u2019 and \u2018sham\u2019 in\nour trial. In contact with patients the expression \u2018minimalacupuncture\u2019 is also avoided to ensure blinding and to increasecompliance. In available trials the response rates of the controlgroups were high [5], suggesting that the various sham inter-ventions had considerable \u2018unspecific\u2019 effects. It should benoted that our studies are only performed to clarify whetheracupuncture is truly more efficacious than minimal or othersham acupuncture interventions. However, according to com-mon simplified ways of interpretation our minimal acupunc-ture intervention would be considered by many as a \u2018placebo control.\u2019 Therefore, we found ourselves in an ethicaldilemma on how to inform patients. Such a dilemma is likely tobe the rule in acupuncture trials but it is rarely made explicit.A relevant proportion of acupuncture trials uses sham inter-ventions which are easily distinguishable from \u2018true\u2019 acupunc-ture. For example, a recent trial published in a major journalused an inactive laser acupuncture pen [28]. Many trials informpatients that two treatment modalities are compared withoutsuggesting that one is a \u2018placebo\u2019 (results of a survey submittedfor publication). This clearly lowers the likelihood of unblind-ing as patients are more likely to find the control interventioncredible, but remains a major ethical issue. We chose a way ofinformation which mentions that one treatment option doesnot meet all elements of traditional acupuncture but we do notmention that many would consider this \u2013 wrongly in our opin-ion \u2013 a placebo. All ethics committees approved our patient in-formation leaflet without reservation and we believe it is ade-quate for the situation.

The methods of the trialstake into account the particular problems of acupuncture re-search as well as recommendations for drug trials in the pro-phylaxis of migraine and tension-type headache [2, 3]. Furthergeneral aspects and issues specific to the trials for low-backpain and osteoarthritis of the knee are discussed in the follow-ing paper [4]. We hope that the results of these trials will rep-resent a major step forward in the scientific evaluation of theeffectiveness of acupuncture for headache.\nAcknowledgement\nWe would like to thank Dr. J.
