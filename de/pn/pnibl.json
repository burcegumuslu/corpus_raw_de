In Switzerland, complementary medicine primarily includes phytotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine, classical homeopathy, and anthroposophic medicine.\nA basic concept inherent in anthroposophic medicine is the integration of scientific and humanities-based/holistic aspects; for this reason, it is considered a prototype of integrative medicine.\nThe Translational Complementary Medicine Research Group investigates therapeutic concepts - especially from phytotherapy and anthroposophical medicine - and studies the mode of action of plant-based remedies.\nDuring its research, the Group will also consider various pharmaceutical extraction and production techniques, and it looks to bring these findings into clinical practice.\nProf. Dr. Carsten Gr\u00fcndemann\nUniversit\u00e4t Basel\nTranslational Complementary Medicine\nBioparc Rosental (Geb\u00e4ude 1060)\nMattenstrasse 22\n4058 Basel\nSchweiz\nTel: +41 61 207 61 84", "language": null, "image": null, "pagetype": "article", "links": ["https://www.enable-javascript.com/de/", "/en/research/research-groups/translational-complementary-medicine/", "#desktop-search", "/de/", "/de/", "https://pharma.unibas.ch", "#active-sub-nav", "#mobile-search", "/de/about-us/", "/de/research/", "/de/education/", "/de/news-events/", "/de/museum/", "/de/about-us/management-services/", "/de/about-us/organisation/", "/de/about-us/standorte-anfahrt/", "/de/about-us/departementsgeschichte/", "/de/about-us/alumnipharma/", "/de/about-us/kontakt/", "/de/research/research-groups/", "/de/research/publications/", "/de/research/research-meetings/", "/de/research/scientific-advisory-board/", "/de/research/emeriti/", "/de/education/bsc-pharm-wissenschaften/", "/de/education/msc-pharmazie/", "/de/education/msc-drug-sciences/", "/de/education/phd/", "/de/education/weiterbildung/", "/de/education/documents/", "/de/", "/de/research/", "/de/research/research-groups/", "#subnav-active", "/de/research/research-groups/translational-complementary-medicine/group-members/", "/de/research/research-groups/translational-complementary-medicine/research/", "/de/research/research-groups/translational-complementary-medicine/masterarbeiten-masters-theses/", "/de/research/research-groups/translational-complementary-medicine/press/", "/de/research/research-groups/translational-complementary-medicine/annual-reports/", "/de/research/research-groups/translational-complementary-medicine/instagram-links/", "#", "/fileadmin/user_upload/pharma/Research_groups/Translational_Complementary_Medicine/Bilder/Other/List_of_Publications_Carsten_Gruendemann_September_2023.pdf", "https://www.instagram.com/partofnature.unibas/", "/de/personen/carsten-gruendemann/", "https://www.vielstoffgemische.de", "#top", "https://unibas.ch/", "/de/datenschutzerklaerung/", "/de/impressum/", "/de/contact-1659/"]}
