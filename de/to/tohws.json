Deliberative theory is based on the assumption \nthat while deliberating, informed citizens weigh information in order to form \n\u2018ideal\u2019 opinions.

While the results confirm previous \nfindings on relatively low levels of political knowledge among the participants, \nthis study raises three further issues that are relevant for understanding the role \nof knowledge in transferring theoretical deliberative norms and ideals to reality. \nThese issues, which relate to the weighing of arguments, the handling of false or \nmissing information, and the issue of procedural knowledge, are highlighted, and implications for further research and possible procedures for the transfer of \nnormative deliberative goals to real-world deliberations are outlined.\nKeywords  \ndeliberation; subjective knowledge; factual knowledge; information, arguments\nhttps://doi.org/10.3224/8474230009OPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION150\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und FordernIntroduction\nWe all hold opinions on a wide range \nof topics and have differing amounts of knowledge about them. If someone asked you about your opinion on the German welfare state, what would you base your \nopinion on and how would you commu-\nnicate your views during a debate in order to persuade others? How much know-ledge do you need to form opinions and talk about them? Research regarding the public\u2018s political knowledge suggests that people generally might not have access to a lot of knowledge to base their opinions on. While some individuals possess a lot of knowledge on some topics, knowledge \nlevels in the population seem to be rather \nlow in general and in relation to political issues particularly. \nOne strand of research that theorizes about \nhow people discuss and come to conclusions is deliberative theory. From this theoret -\nical perspective there are specific condi-tions for successful deliberations, such as \na knowledgeable, informed  citizenry and \na rational exchange of arguments. Theories \nsuggest that participants form a sort of group consensus by exchanging arguments, evaluating them and possibly altering their opinions in the process. Based on prop-ositions regarding the role of knowledge within deliberative theory and findings on the real-world distribution of political knowledge within the population, one might ask: what knowledge do people draw on to discuss political issues within deliberative settings, given that they are not fully in-formed? Do people know and talk about objective facts on the wealth distribution in Germany when discussing opinions on the German welfare state or do they base \ntheir arguments on subjective experiences? \nResearch regarding knowledge and delib-\neration has so far focused largely on the effects that deliberative settings have on individuals\u2019 political knowledge and the circumstances under which knowledge can be increased, but there is surprisingly little research focusing on the role of knowledge in actual deliberation (cf. Ryfe 2005) or the \nmicro-mechanisms by which it operates (cf. \nSmets et al. 2014). Often, while partici-pants\u2019 knowledge levels can be evaluated with quantitative methods from question-naires, the deliberation process itself is a black box. Many studies look at the effects of deliberation on opinion by analysing pre- and post-surveys, yet they do not actually look at the content of what is \nbeing said (see Bucy et al. 2014; e.g. Smets \net al. 2014; Gastil et al. 1999; Fishkin et al. 1999; Jacobs et al. 2009; Sturgis et al. 2005;  Morrell 2005). Even though these studies \nfind changes in attitudes or knowledge lev-els, the specific mechanisms leading to the change of attitude or increase in knowledge remain unclear. Regarding the process of deliberation, one could ask whether the debates were in fact rational and what kind OPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION151\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und Fordernof knowledge the arguments were based \non. The question of which information was utilized in the discussions and what was ignored or left out is also a relevant one. Especially when seeking to understand \nthe process of attitude formation, it may \nbe relevant to look at the actual discussion instead of pre- and post-evaluations. \nWithin the broader literature on the relation \nbetween knowledge and attitude forma-tion, this paper therefore opens the black box of deliberation and goes beyond the established survey methods to measure po-litical knowledge with a qualitative content \nanalysis of an actual debate. Empirically, the \npaper draws on discussion data gathered in the context of a Deliberative Forum (DF), as explained in greater detail in the introduction to this volume (see Heuer et al). It aims to explore the role of knowledge within real life deliberations by gaining an insight into the participant\u2019s level of political knowledge regarding the welfare \nstate as well as by assessing the different \nkinds of knowledge that participants base their arguments on. In a broader sense, this research is motivated by the desire to learn about how theoretical conceptualizations and ideal notions of deliberation are applied in real life in order to improve the transition from theory to practice. \nThe remaining article is structured as \nfollows: the next section focuses on the \ntheoretical level and outlines the ideal assumptions of deliberative theory regard-ing the role of knowledge in deliberations. Then, I shift the focus to the real-world application of deliberation and empirical findings in this regard. In the final step, I \nbring together and discuss the theoretical \nideals against the backdrop of real-world application regarding the role of knowledge in the process of deliberation. The findings highlight three main issues that play a role in transitioning from deliberative theory to practice, namely the weighing of infor -\nmation, the handling of false or missing information, and the issue of procedural knowledge in the attitude formation pro-\ncess. In the conclusion, I introduce the \nconcept of procedural knowledge and map out possibilities for improving real-life uses of deliberation.\nTheoretical Assumptions: \nDeliberation and Knowledge\nAlthough the use of the term deliberation \nhas become widespread, there is no coher -\nent, conceptual definition of it (cf. Abelson et al. 2003; Burkhalter et al. 2002; Macedo 1999; Niemeyer et al. 2007). As Andr\u00e9 \nB\u00e4chtiger (cf. 2010: 35) puts it: \u2018beyond \nthe bedrock agreement that democratic process should involve communication about, rather than merely aggregation of (fixed), preferences, there is not much consensus about how deliberation is best conceptualized. \u2019 The main idea that has OPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION152\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und Fordernbeen promoted by deliberation theorists \nsuch as Joshua Cohen (1998), J\u00fcrgen Habermas (1984), John Dryzek (2000), James Fishkin (1991), and others is that within certain deliberative settings, groups \nare able to make \u2018better\u2019 decisions regard-\ning societal problems. John Hibbing and Elizabeth Theiss-Morse (2002) state that deliberation should lead to \u2018better citizens\u2019 , \u2018better decisions\u2019 , and a \u2018better system\u2019 . \nWith respect to attitude formation, delib-\neration can be seen as a process by which minds can be changed provided that indi-viduals come into this setting with both a \nwillingness and the means to communi -\ncate, advocate, and ultimately to become \npersuaded along with and by others (cf. McCubbins et al. 2006: 14). What conditions enable productive deliberation? And what is necessary for people to be able to deliberate? In theoretical terms, James Fishkin (2005) suggests the following criteria based on the idea that deliberation is mostly rooted in the \n\u2018weighing\u2019 of arguments in a discussion: the \narguments need to be \u2018informative\u2019 as well as \u2018balanced\u2019 such that discussions include contrary arguments; they should also be \u2018substantive\u2019 , meaning that arguments are considered on their own and not based on who made them. The participants in delib-erations are supposed to be \u2018conscientious\u2019 , willing to talk and listen with civility and respect, and the deliberation itself should \nbe \u2018comprehensive\u2019 and reflect all points of \nview held by significant proportions of the population (cf. Fishkin et al. 2005: 2). This normative concept of deliberation entails assumptions that do not hold true in so-called \u2018real-world\u2019 deliberations, which is why a discussion has emerged around the \nquestion of which circumstances enable the \nachievement of the normatively described outcomes of deliberation (cf. Risse 2000; B\u00e4chtiger et al. 2010; Sachweh et al. 2006; Esterling et al. 2011; Thompson 2008; Ulbert et al. 2005). \nWhat does the literature say regarding the \nrole that knowledge plays within delibera-tion and the mechanisms underpinning it? \nFirst of all, normative deliberative theory \npostulates that deliberation takes place as a reasoned process, in which arguments are often backed up by objective facts, which in turn can stem from the participants\u2019 knowl-edge. Here, the role of knowledge is to serve as the basis for arguments and to give them more weight in order to convince others. As participants exchange information, this \nincreases their knowledge, because they \nlisten to the information and perspectives of others and take them in. \u2018This occurs be-cause deliberation requires that individuals transcend private concerns and that they engage with competing views, taking them into account as part of their evaluations\u2019 (cf. Niemeyer et al. 2007: 500). Concerning the change in attitude, Thomas and Keith Pool (1987) point out that individuals\u2019 informa-\ntion affects their confidence in their beliefs, \nplaying a role in the activation of values.OPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION153\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und FordernDeliberative theory envisions that de-\nliberation will enable citizens to develop more informed or reflective preferences than would otherwise be the case. Several empirical research projects have found \nthat deliberation increases knowledge (see \ne.g. Min 2007: 1371; Fishkin et al. 2005; Gastil et al. 1999) and leads to opinion change on political topics, because it can enable participants to deeply engage with political topics, share information, and weigh alternatives. Findings show a clear positive association between deliberation and citizens\u2019 political knowledge (Gastil and Dillard 1999). While it seems intuitive \nthat deliberation will result in increased \nknowledge and attitude change and this has also been shown empirically, it is worth examining in detail the process of how deliberation affects political knowledge.\nReal\u00ad world Implications: Political \nKnowledge and its Distribution\nHow can we conceptualize knowledge? Michael Delli Carpini and Scott Keeter (cf. 1996: 10) offer a rather broad definition of political knowledge as \u2018the range of factual information about politics that is \nstored in long-term memory\u2019 . Thus, infor -\nmation is the key term that differentiates \n knowledge from other belief systems, such \nas attitudes, values, or opinions. This type of knowledge\u2014i.e. knowledge that an indi-vidual actually has\u2014is defined as objective  political knowledge. In addition to that, \nthere is subjective political knowledge, \nwhich refers to information that an indi-\nvidual believes he or she possesses. This distinction is especially important in the context of deliberation. While objective and subjective knowledge overlap with regard to objective facts, it is harder to assess whether claims based on an individuals\u2019 percep-tion of reality accurately depict the real world (cf. Maier et al. 2009: 143). Political \nknowledge can be distinguished in terms \nof its breadth and depth. Breadth refers to knowledge in different areas and depth refers to knowledge in individual areas. Research has found that the greater the amount of (objective) political knowledge an indi  vidual has, the more new political \nknowledge is gained through media con-\nsumption or election campaigns (cf. Oberle 2012: 20). The concept of political know-\nledge also includes the normative question \nof what citizens should know about politics, and although there are multiple answers to this question, it is generally agreed that political knowledge should include stored information about the structures of the political system (\u2018what government is and does\u2019 (cf. Barber 1969: 38)), its political institutions (cf. Neuman 1986: 196), and \nknowledge about current political questions \n(cf. Berelson et al. 1954: 308).\nBut what is political knowledge with re-\nspect to deliberation on the social welfare state? Hard facts include knowledge on the OPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION154\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und Forderndifferent programmes that are part of the \nsocial welfare system in Germany and how they emerged and developed. Other im-portant facts may include information on the current economic situation in Germany \nand the current state of the job market. In \norder to form a reasoned opinion on the German welfare state, it is necessary to have some knowledge on the distribution of wealth in Germany, for example, on how unequally wealth is distributed in Germany or how many people are living in relative poverty.\nRegarding the distribution of political \nknowledge in a very general sense, research \nfinds that citizens\u2019 knowledge falls short of the theoretical ideal (Butler et al. 1974; Campbell et al. 1960; Converse 2006) and most ordinary citizens know and think remarkably little about politics (Carpini et al. 1996). While the majority of these findings come from the United States, and although it has been shown that US \ncitizens on average possess less knowledge \nthan citizens of other western democra-cies (cf. Almond et al. 1963; Carpini et al. 1996; Dimock et al. 1997; Bennett et al. 1996), studies on other countries also find low levels of overall knowledge (for Denmark see Paldam et al. 2000; for New Zealand see Karp 2006; for Netherlands see Vettehen et al. 2004). While findings show  generally low levels of overall know-\nledge, there are some political facts that are known by almost everyone (e.g. the recent US  president, cf. Carpini et al. 1996: \n70\u201374), but there are also topics where knowledge is almost non-existent\u2014e.g. knowledge about arms control and nuclear weapons (Graham 1988). While there are \nnumerous Anglo-Saxonian academic con-\ntroversies regarding political knowledge, literature on Germany is still fairly scarce, especially with regards to knowledge about the welfare system (Osterberg-Kaufmann 2019: 4). J\u00fcrgen Maier et al. (2009) attri-bute this to the poor availability of data on citizens\u2019 knowledge (with a few valuable exceptions, e.g. the International Social Survey Programme/ISSP). A study by R\u00fc-\ndiger Schmitt-Beck finds that only just \nabout half of Germans knew the number of federal states in Germany (Schmitt-Beck 1993). Studies have also found that Germans have a reasonable breadth of knowledge regarding the existence of po -\nlitical institutions such as NATO or the EU (cf. Rattinger 1994), but relatively limited knowledge of the German election system \n(cf. Schmitt-Beck 1993). \nSince the data and literature regarding po-\nlitical knowledge in Germany is very poor, there is even less information regarding the specific area of knowledge about social welfare availability. There has not been in-depth research regarding specific areas of politics, which is why there are not many findings regarding the research question \nthis paper asks about: namely the level of \nknowledge regarding social welfare. One OPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION155\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und Fordernpaper gives first insights into the knowl-\nedge that 25 to 35 year-olds have of the German public pension system and finds that overall there is good knowledge of the basics and central concepts (cf. Brosig \n2016). However, accurate knowledge of \nindividual regulations and other marginal aspects was much less common. The paper also finds that many participants signifi-cantly overestimated the level of benefits and the redistribution mechanisms of the pension system and may therefore run the risk of having insufficient social security entitle ments in the long term (cf. Brosig \n2016). Having established the fact that \nalthough knowledge varies across topics, \nlevels in the population seem generally low and that there is not much data regarding knowledge levels in Germany, I will con-tinue to explore how knowledge can be measured and conceptualized.\nExploration: Conceptualizing \nKnowledge in Deliberation\nResearch focusing on the knowledge that \npeople rely on in real-world deliberation has outlined the need for a broader conceptual-ization of knowledge. As mentioned above, research mostly distinguishes between ob-\njective and subjective knowledge, with the \nmethod of data collection via \u2018civic tests\u2019 (Bucy et al. 2014; Thompson et al. 2006). With regard to the role of knowledge in deliberation, there is a need to broaden this theoretical conceptualization of knowledge to mean something other than a collection of facts. This would make it possible to de-\ntect, explore and work with different kinds \nof knowledge that are not straightforward facts but \u2018temporally and spatially situated\u2019 (Thompson et al. 2006). Connected to this, David Ryfe (2006) finds that in the current debate, people do not merely exchange their knowledge via facts, but mostly commu-nicate their knowledge and arguments in the form of stories that make complicated \nissues amenable to human understanding. \nIn doing so, knowledge is not always stated explicitly, but is also communicated im-plicitly, with participants relying on their mutual knowledge of the group to connect the implications of their story to the topic of debate. Another source of knowledge that might be found in deliberation is the use of heuristics or information shortcuts. Research from political psychology suggests \nthat in their everyday reasoning, people tend \nto compensate for their lack of information by relying on heuristics and other cognitive shortcuts (cf. Popkin 1994; Sniderman et al. 1993), which suggests that people might not argue based on direct knowledge but rather state opinions from sources that they trust.\nLooking at the existing literature, what \nlevel of knowledge regarding the welfare \nstate can be expected and what forms of knowledge will the participants base their arguments on? Since the topic under discussion is very specific and the Hartz OPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION156\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und FordernIV benefit we discussed in detail is not an \narea that a lot of people have spent time reading about, we can expect the level of knowledge not to be high. Regarding the kinds of knowledge, the theoretical \ndeliberative process is envisioned as an ex-\nchange of ideas, knowledge, and opinions within a group discussion under special circumstances that leads to normatively \u2018better\u2019 choices on the part of the partici-pants. One would therefore theoretically expect to find participants deliberating based on objective facts and weighing the arguments against each other. On the other hand, real-world findings show low levels \nof knowledge in the general population \nand research on real-world deliberations suggests that opinions are often exchanged in the form of \u2018stories\u2019 and that knowledge can also appear in the form of situated knowledge rather than straightforward objective facts.\nProcedure and Participants\nIn order to explore the role of knowledge within deliberative settings, I analysed data collected within a deliberative forum, where people from different social and educational backgrounds were brought \ntogether in order to discuss issues re -\ngarding the German welfare state. The \nparticipants filled out questionnaires before and after the forum and took part in large and small, moderated group discussions throughout a whole day. For this analysis, I focus on the discussions that centred on the participants\u2019 general attitude regarding \nGermany\u2019s Hartz IV benefit, the fairness \nof the welfare system, and the situation of job centres. No information packs were distributed prior to the forum, meaning that participants\u2019 discussions were based on their own political knowledge. During the discussions, participants were allowed and encouraged to raise their own questions. The facilitators were instructed to cover \nthe three mentioned topics, but otherwise \nto allow the discussion to continue in an unstructured way. The participants themselves decided when to participate and what knowledge they were willing to share in the discussions. Greater details on the methodological approach can be found in the introduction to this volume (cf. Heuer et al.). \nFindings: Level of Political \nKnowledge on Social Welfare \nSubjective and objective knowl\u00ad\nedge in standardized questions\nIn the first step I looked at the distribution \nof political knowledge in the \u2018traditional\u2019 sense by evaluating standardized ques-tions that participants answered before the discussions. Regarding subjective know-\nledge, the participants were asked how \nwell informed they felt they were about the OPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION157\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und Fordernwelfare state in general on a scale ranging \nfrom very poorly informed (1) to very well informed (5). They were also asked how well informed they felt regarding the more specific topics of parental leave, pensions, \nsocial security, healthcare, and the Hartz \nIV benefit. The answers provided ranged from very poorly informed to very well informed and on average, the participants reported feeling fairly well informed about the welfare state in general (x\n\u2013 = 3.41, range \n= 1-5). In contrast, the participants\u2019 felt less well informed regarding the specific areas of the welfare state. They felt least informed on the topics of parental leave (x\n\u2013 = 2.8, range = 1-5) and pensions, followed in increasing order by social security, health care, and Hartz IV (x\n\u2013 = 3.3, range = 1-5; \nsee online-appendix for summary statistics: table 9.2.1 and table 9.2.2). \nTo assess their objective, factual knowledge, \nthe participants were asked to identify the \ncurrent unemployment rate in Germany and the proportion of people who are at risk of poverty from a selection of possible answers. The unemployment rate and the relative poverty rate in Germany were at 6% and 20% respectively at the time of the survey. The questions were selected because they \nFigure 1: Distribution of Participants\u2019 Objective Knowledge Estimates\nSource: Own IllustrationOPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION158\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und Forderntest overall knowledge about the topic and \nare not so specific that an average participant could not be expected to know them.\nWith regards to the unemployment rate \nin Germany, the participants\u2019 answers \nranged from 5% to 45%, which indicates that some participants who were discussing the topic of the welfare state were under the impression that over a third of the population is unemployed. One third of the participants identified a percentage range that included the correct answer, while two thirds overestimated the proportion of unemployed people by at least 5%. While \nthere were no underestimates, participants \nwho overestimated the unemployment rate on average did so by at least 13.6% (SD: 9.4) and assumed an unemployment rate of at least 20.6% in Germany; the actual rate being 6%. \nThere are similar results when it comes to \nthe participants\u2019 estimations of the at risk of \npoverty rate. Participants\u2019 answers ranged \nfrom an at risk of poverty rate estimation of 15\u201319% all the way to more than 50%, with less than one third of the participants identifying the correct rate and more than two thirds overestimating the relative pover -\nty rate by at least 5% (Figure 1). On aver -\nage, people who overestimated the relative poverty rate did so by at least 15.3% (SD: 8.4) and assumed a relative poverty rate \nin Germany of at least 37.3%. There is a \nmoderate positive correlation between the answers given for the unemployment rate and for the relative poverty rate (r_s = 0.6, p = .0009), meaning that participants who overestimated the relative poverty rate also tended to overestimate the unemployment \nrate. Looking at the answers to both ques-\ntions, six participants (22%) gave correct answers in both cases, while the other 21 (77.8%) were incorrect at least once. \nImplications I  \nThe results on the levels and distribution \nof subjective and factual knowledge on \nthe welfare state are in line with empirical \nfindings on the distribution of political knowledge in Germany on other topics. Since the sample is not collected at random and the size is so small, the results cannot be generalized beyond this study, but they do give an insight into the levels of know-ledge that the participants in the deliber -\nation I analysed brought with them. The \nfindings on subjective knowledge might \nindicate that the Hartz IV system is what people mostly associate with the welfare state and that their subjective knowledge on the general topic was mostly just their subjective knowledge on Hartz IV , because this is what came to their mind when they thought about their knowledge of the welfare state in general. It is also plausible that people in general feel less confident or \ninformed when it comes to specific topics \ncompared to more general ones. OPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION159\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und FordernOnly about one-fifth of the participants \nwere able to identify the correct employ-ment and at risk of poverty rates, which are two pieces of information that can be seen as important if people are to develop \na rational, informed opinion about the \nwelfare state in Germany. It seems that the participants felt sufficiently informed on a subjective level, but tended to have a lack of specific, factual information about the target groups who are most relevant when discussing the social welfare system.\nOn a side note: even though this study\u2019s pri-\nmary goal was not to look at the relation-\nship between knowledge and education, \nit is noteworthy that while I expected knowledge to be positively correlated with education, this was only the case for objective, factual knowledge; there was no substantial difference regarding subjective knowledge with regards to education (see online-appendix for more details: 9.3.). \nI will now turn to the results from the \nqualitative analysis regarding the differ -\nent kinds of knowledge that participants based their arguments on. Do we find a discussion including arguments at the  societal level\u2014i.e. arguments on the impact \nof certain policies on poverty rates and changes in the distribution of wealth\u2014or do we find discussions at the particular level, based on subjective knowledge such \nas personal experiences? Differentiating Knowledge in \nDeliberation\nSources of Political Knowledge\nMotivated by the theoretical assumption \nthat knowledge in deliberative settings enables the formation of normatively \nbetter opinions, and bearing in mind the \ngenerally low levels of knowledge in the public, I used a qualitative and exploratory approach in order to look at the role of knowledge in the actual debates. This might expand our understanding of how delibera-tion and political knowledge interact in the process of attitude formation and provide an understanding of how knowledge can be conceptualized and what kinds of know-\nledge are used in exchanges of opinion with \nother people. For the exploratory part of the analysis, the participants\u2019 discussions were transcribed and read into MaxQDA for a qualitative content analysis. In this process, I used a coding scheme that was partly deductive and partly inductive and captured the different kinds of knowledge the participants drew on in their argu-\nments. The coding scheme started out \nwith previously described categories of knowledge from theory such as subjective and objective knowledge, further categories that appeared in the data were added until category saturation occurred.\nAfter briefly introducing the different \nkinds of knowledge that emerged from OPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION160\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und Fordernthe  content analysis, I will discuss the \nimplications of these categories in the de-\nliberation with regards to the deliberative goals formulated in theory. In line with the literature, I analysed the participants\u2019 \narguments and statements of opinion based \non the categories of subjective and objec-tive knowledge. In the process, further distinctions between different sources of knowledge emerged within those cat-egories.\nA) Subjective Knowledge: Most arguments \nwere based on subjective knowledge, which was conveyed in the form of \npersonal experiences or observations. \nLooking at the discussion, I can further differentiate subjective knowledge into knowledge based on personal experi-ence and knowledge gained from other people\u2019s experiences, which I will call hearsay. The following quote is a prime example for hearsay:\nAnd this trained attendant, who does this for several people, told me that there are many cases where people are flushed out and kicked out of statistics, so to speak.(EL1: 62)\nHearsay was used in two different ways. On some occasions, it served as a substitute for the participants\u2019 own experience. In those instances, participants would mention that they did not have their own experiences with the topic and then substituted information that they had heard from third parties (online-appendix: 9.1.2). In other instances (see above), hearsay \nwas used to lend more credibility to \na subjective claim, which is to make it more objective by citing a more experienced or more credible person. \nB) Objective Knowledge: Normative de-liberative theory describes factual  information as a necessary deliberative \ncircumstance. Y et, in our deliberation \nFigure 2: Overview of Sources of Political Knowledge\nSource: Own IllustrationOPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION161\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und FordernNormative deliberative theory describes \nfactual information as a necessary deliberative \ncircumstance. Y et, in our deliberation [...] more \narguments were based on subjective, \nrather than on factual knowledge\"\nthis was not the case: more arguments \nwere based on subjective, rather than on factual knowledge. The factual know-ledge that participants based their argu-ments on also ranged from very specific \ninformation, such as the fact that state \ntransfer payments also cover costs of acquiring a driver\u2019s licence (ET1: 37) to very  general information such as \ninformation on the recent economic growth in Berlin (MIX1: 333). There were also instances where participants claimed factual, objective information that was objectively wrong: \u2018There are about two million long-term jobless \npeople in Germany\u2019 (EL1: 130). \nC) Creativity : In addition to subjective \nand objective knowledge, participants \nalso drew on their stored knowledge and used their creativity to come up with examples that would fit their argument or underline it. Those  examples were not specifically based \non personal experience or objective \nfacts, but were rather loosely inspired by them and tailored to the situation. Imagine the following scenario: Somebody works their whole life, when they are 56, [a locksmith] gets laid off and doesn\u2019t find a new employment. He falls into \nthe Hartz IV category. And then \nthey [employees at Jobcenter] say: \u201cYou\u2019re approaching 60, does it even make sense to put you in an-other training program?\u201d So they basically say no. The people have worked their whole life, have paid taxes their whole life and then they get treated like this. (MIX1: 267)\nThe role of knowledge in the process of deliberation\nAs mentioned before, the weighing of argu-\nments is one of the crucial factors leading to positive outcomes in deliberations. Theory assumes that participants weigh informa-tion and then come to a better solution; \nin this respect, the discussion from this \n deliberation raises some issues that are rele-\nvant to the real-world implications of delibe-rations. In the qualitative content analysis of the discussion, it became apparent that OPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION162\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und Fordern participants\u2019 ability to weigh arguments in \nthe deliberation was inhibited for multiple reasons, which will be highlighted below. \nA) Generalizability: In a rational discus-\nsion, one would expect people to sup-\nport arguments with evidence. This means that broad and general claims at the societal level would be based on objective facts, while claims on the individual level would also be based on personal experiences. In the delibe-rative forum, when asked to discuss their opinion on one aspect of the welfare state in Germany, some par -\nticipants talked about what is best for society and pitched their arguments at that general, societal level, while others argued based on what is best for them and argued at the specific, individual level. Subjective knowledge was used as a basis for arguments at the  individual level, but also for arguments \nat the societal level, meaning that the \ninformation participants provided to \nsupport their arguments did not always match the level of generalization that the argument was aiming for. \nAnd at that moment the whole thing is unfair, yes. Well, let\u2018s just say a few cases I\u2018ve had lately: Domestic violence: A woman is in the women\u2018s shelter. The whole family situation \nis unclear. The children are unclear. \nHer health is under threat, finances are under threat. Everything is in dissolution somewhere. And the job center demands she submit ten job applications a month. That is extremely unfair. (MIX1: 66)\nIn this case, the participant argues that the whole system is unfair, but only provides subjective experiences describing individual occurrences of unjust situations; the participant does not offer information about how common those situations are to justify her claim that the system in general is unjust. In the deliberation, no one \npointed to this evidence mismatch, \nwhich might indicate that people did not notice or process this shortcom-ing. The fact that participants did not always make valid claims and argued at both the individual and the societal level also means that people did not necessarily debate at the same level or craft linear arguments. On multiple \noccasions, the participants did not \nrespond to each other, but started talking about their own points of view, bringing in new aspects. This made the weighing of arguments more difficult because it hindered the discussion and examination of some aspects or thoughts. When a discussion turns into a chain of arguments about Hartz IV that do not refer to each other, it \nis harder to evaluate them and reach \na group consensus.OPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION163\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und FordernB) Perspective : Another aspect that also \nconnects to different levels of gener -\nalizability is perspective. The partici -\npants in the deliberation did not seem \nto put the information provided for a \nspecific claim into perspective. This \nbecame apparent in two ways. First, there were the creative examples peo-ple used, which were highly tailored to the argument but did not necessarily have a lot of weight when put into the perspective of the bigger picture. On the question whether Hartz IV is just or not, one participant stated: \n[Hartz IV] is unfair, because some [people] do not want to work. It happens that some simply arrange with it and simply says: (sigh) I do not want to; I do not feel like it. I do not try, even if I write my ten  applications [...]. And then the \ntaxpayer, meaning the rest of society that works and practically contri-\nbutes with their taxes, finance those. \nAnd that is unfair. (MIX1: 94)\nIf looked at from a normative, delibe-rative perspective, these more or less made-up examples can be disadvanta-geous because they might influence peo-ple by perfectly fitting their argument, while leaving the questions of how often and at what rate this particular situa-\ntion actually occurs at the societal level \nunanswered. A second way in which participants illustrate a lack of perspec-tive in their weighing of arguments is when they provide one positive and one negative example in order to describe a neutral position towards a topic. Again, \nthe weighing process, i.e. the question \nof which situations are more important or happen more frequently, is not part of the deliberative process:\n\u2018Uh, I would situate myself in the middle, because I believe that, so, to assess [Hartz IV] generally, is totally difficult, because there are many aspects in there that are part-\nly fair and partly unjust. \u2019 (ET1: 187)\nIn these instances, the weighing of ar -\nguments can be regarded as  incomplete. \nFrom a deliberative perspective, it is \nnot enough to know that a specific situation exists; it is also necessary to assess how much weight the situation has in relation to the issue under de-\nbate (e.g. what is the proportion of fair \nand unfair aspects of Hartz IV?). This example also raises the question why the participant does not simply weigh the just and unjust aspects known to them. One possibility is that they might need additional information that they do not possess. \nC) No knowledge, no opinion: In some \ninstances, the participants asked ques-\ntions and signalled a lack of informa-OPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION164\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und Forderntion with regards to certain topics or \nthe overall topic. Most of the time, the participants combined the claim of no knowledge with a claim of a neutral opinion towards the topic. \nI would just settle for the 5, com-pletely neutral because, as I said, I have no personal experience and I only know that by hearsay. (ET1: 61)\nWhen participants stated that they did not have an opinion due to a lack of information, they did not specify what information they would need in order to \nform an opinion. In connection with the \npoints raised above, it seems that par -\nticipants do not only lack information, but on a more basic level do not always know what information they would need in order to form an opinion. \nImplications II: Procedural Knowledge\nThe findings above highlight some areas \nwhere deliberative settings as described in theory seem to be difficult to imple-ment in real-life debates. It was evident that people argue at different levels of generalizability, do not necessarily make arguments linearly and sometimes do not put arguments into perspective. These issues, combined with the handling of missing knowledge, point to one possible \nconclusion: participants in deliberations \nlack the procedural knowledge necessary to weigh information and formulate an informed opinion as portrayed in theory. How can we overcome these obstacles? It may be beneficial in future deliberative forums to pay attention to this possible lack \nof procedural knowledge. The following \nsuggestions may be useful:\nTo address generalizability : If a deliberative \nprocess aims at finding and discussing \n societal problems and finding solutions at \nthe societal level, it might help to struc-ture the discussion such that the first step emphasizes individual experiences and opinions and the second step asks partici-\npants to think about and discuss how their \nopinions may change when the emphasis is put on the aggregated, societal level.\nHandling missing knowledge : The findings \nregarding knowledge gaps in connection \nwith neutral opinions raises questions for future deliberations. How can facilitators deal with missing information? If there are \nquestions that come up in a discussion and \nnobody is able to answer them, it would be helpful in the future to implement a mechanism that enables people to gain this information on the spot and overcome their uncertainty\u2014moreover, information packs should be distributed beforehand. In addition to this procedural problem of information gaps, a second problem relates to knowledge gaps that people might not \neven be aware of they have. Since the public \noften lacks factual information on various OPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION165\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und Fordernproblems, future deliberative forums could \nincorporate opportunities for participants to improve their procedural knowledge on opinion formation by holding a discussion in which participants talk about what in-\nformation they think is necessary to form \nan informed, reasoned opinion. In order to improve the participants\u2019 abilities to weigh arguments and information, participants could be asked to reflect on and discuss how their opinion would change hypothetically if certain objective facts change (e.g. What difference would it make if the unemploy-ment rate was 50% compared to 10%).\nOutlook\nLocated within the broader literature on the relation between knowledge and attitude formation in group discussions, this article set out to go beyond pre- and post-questions and quantitative analysis and to explore \nthe distribution and the role of knowledge \nwithin a deliberative setting. The descriptive analysis revealed mixed levels of factu-al information among participants, with around a fifth of them able to identify the German unemployment rate and poverty risk rate in Germany and others estimating the poverty risk rate to be as high as 50% or more. As mentioned in the introduction to this volume (Heuer et al), it needs to be \nnoted that the participants in this study were \nnot selected at random, but rather with the goal in mind to capture a heterogeneous group with regards to gender, age, political preferences and migration background. Therefore, descriptive results should not be generalized to a broader population. They \nrather serve as informative environment \nwithin which the arguments made in the deliberation are looked at.\nThe qualitative content analysis uncovered \nthe different kinds of knowledge that argu-ments are based on, which adds to previ-ous research emphasizing that knowledge may not just be subjective or objective but alternatively be multifaceted and context \ndependent. This study of a real-world dis-\ncussion with people from Berlin drawing on their everyday knowledge unfolded the many possible deviations from the theoretical concept of deliberation. This was discussed in terms of generalizability, perspective, and knowledge gaps. \nThe content analysis of the actual discussion \nalso raises questions for further considera-\ntion. What patterns of arguments emerge within the course of deliberation? This is relevant regarding the level of generaliza-bility and the found mismatches between consecutive comments in the deliberation. Would participants use more factual in-formation if they were better informed? To distinguish between the role of factual and procedural knowledge, further research \ncould compare the findings of this work to \na deliberative discussion with information input, in order to determine what kinds OPENING THE BLACK BOX OF DELIBERATION166\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und Fordernof information people rely on in an infor -\nmation-rich environment and establish \nwhether the distribution of the kinds of knowledge utilized in the debate differ from the categories identified in this article. Like -\nwise, research in this direction would gain insights to the question whether people use subjective experiences as a substitute for a lack of objective, generalizable knowledge. \nThe findings here allow scholars to reflect on \nthe mechanisms at work in the relationship between deliberation and attitude forma-tion. It might not just be a lack of factual knowledge that keeps groups from reaching \na well-informed, reasoned consensus, but \nalso the absence of procedural knowledge. We live in a time when Wikipedia is never far; hence, getting factual information will become less relevant in the future. On a more general level, though, we will still need procedural knowledge in order to decide what information to look for and how to evaluate it. Coming back to the beginning \nof this article, instead of asking how much \nknowledge people need to form opinions and talk about them, we should ask what kind of knowledge people need as well as analysing how their opinions change when the underlying information changes.REFERENCES\nAbelson, Julia/Forest, Pierre-Gelier/Eyles, John/Smith, \nPatricia/Martin, Elisabeth/Gauvin, Francois-Pierre  \n(2003): Deliberations about deliberative methods: Issues in the design and evaluation of public participation processes. \nIn: Social Science and Medicine vol. 57/2, p. 239-251.\nAlmond, Gabriel Abraham/Verba, Sidney (1963): The \nCivic Culture: Political Attitudes and Democracy in Five Nations.

Das ist so\u2018n Eindruck, dass ich\u2018s sehr ungerecht finde.APPENDIX291\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und Fordern1215 MIX1: 113 \u201c Also ich m\u00f6chte jetzt keine Jobcenter in Berlin nennen, aber das Jobcenter, wo ich angebunden bin seit mehr oder weniger \nzehn Jahren, da l\u00e4uft das ordentlich. Da habe ich innerhalb von einer halben Stunde die Erlaubnis gehabt, mir eine neue Woh-\nnung zu suchen. In anderen Jobcentern dauert die Erlaubnis solange, bis der an, bis der, na, vorgeblich Vermieter die Nase voll \nhat und sagt: \u201eSo, die Wohnung kriegt jetzt ein anderer\u201c, ja. Wohnungsmarkt.\u201c \n1216 MIX1: 113 \u201eDas stimmt. Also ich kenne das halt auch vom Ausland her, dass es dieses Sicherheitssystem nicht gibt, und dass einfach alles viel mehr auf den Menschen selbst ausgerichtet ist.\u201c \n1217 EL1: 37 \u201eIch habe dort mein Geld gekriegt, aber die Bedingung das zu kriegen und das, was ich nebenbei h\u00f6ren und (unverst.) muss. \nUnd dann wie die Leute dort sind, die das Geld erhalten - ich sage, das ist ein gro\u00dfes Minus. Das ist ein gro\u00dfes Minus.\u201c \n1218 EL1: 41 \u201eAlso ich muss sagen und auch wie man mich behandelt hat, das war immer zuvorkommend und (...) das andere ist ja mein Be-\nm\u00fchen. Ich muss sagen, es gab mir eine Sicherheit und wenn es das nicht gegeben h\u00e4tte, ich wei\u00df, diese K\u00e4mpfe, und die Gelder \ngehen weg, weil das nicht so reinkommt. Ich habe ja auch R\u00fccklagen gehabt. Also von daher bin ich froh, dass es das so gibt.\u201c \n1219 EL1: 141 \u201eUnd ich muss wirklich sagen, das kann ich aus eigener Erfahrung sagen, wenn mir meine Familie nicht hier und da etwas zustecken w\u00fcrde, was ich nat\u00fcrlich beim Amt NICHT angeben darf, weil mir das sonst auch wieder abgezogen wird, w\u00fcrde \nich wirklich in einer Abw\u00e4rtsspirale landen.Und ich muss wirklich das Geld zwei Mal umdrehen und es ist wirklich zu wenig. Es ist wirklich zu wenig.\u201c \n12110 MIX1: 66 \u201eUnd in dem Moment ist das ganze ungerecht, ja. Also ich sage mal blo\u00df ein paar F\u00e4lle, die ich in letzter Zeit hatte: H\u00e4usliche Gewalt: Eine Frau ist im Frauenhaus. Die ganze famili\u00e4re Situation ist ungekl\u00e4rt. Die Kinder sind ungekl\u00e4rt. Die Gesundheit ist angegriffen, Finanzen sind angegriffen. Alles ist irgendwo in Aufl\u00f6sung. Und das Jobcenter verlangt zehn Bewerbungen pro \nMonat. Das ist \u00e4u\u00dferst ungerecht.\u201c\n1.2.2 Hearsay\n1221 MIX1: 267 \u201cIch bin selber noch nie beim Jobcenter gewesen. Also kann ich das eigentlich nicht beurteilen, aber Freunde halt. [\u2026]Und da \nsind mir ein paar Sachen aufgefallen.,. Ich wei\u00df zwar nicht, ob das jetzt noch so ist, aber die mussten als das erste Mal quasi \narbeitslos wurden und in dieses Hartz IV dann reingerutscht sind, zu irgendwelchen, sage ich mal, Kursen. [\u2026] Also die haben dann auch gesagt: \u201e Was soll ich hier?\u201c. Und ich denke halt, so ein Ding w\u00e4re, dass irgendjemand mal pr\u00fcfen muss, diese Firmen \n[\u2026]. Weil das ist vergeudete Lebensenergie, vergeudete Zeit, und man wird auch, wenn man da hinkommt und da teilnehmen \nmuss, damit man sein Geld kriegt ja auch nicht gerade positiv und motiviert, sondern das geht eher so rum, weil das also v\u00f6llig beknackt ist.\u201c\n1222 EL1: 62 \u201cInsofern bin ich zufrieden, muss aber sagen, glaube ich, dass ich das alleine nicht geschafft h\u00e4tte. Das geht wirklich nur mit einem Begleiter. Und dieser Begleiter, der das f\u00fcr mehrere Menschen macht, hat mir erz\u00e4hlt, dass es viele F\u00e4lle gibt, wo die Leute sozusagen rausgesp\u00fclt werden und aus der Statistik gekickt werden und ja. \u201dAPPENDIX292\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und Fordern1223 MIX1: 267 \u201ewas ich auch geh\u00f6rt habe, was mich sehr, sehr w\u00fctend macht, ist wenn jemand seine Arbeit verliert und, ich sage jetzt mal so, \n58, 60, 61, 62 ist. Der wird gar nicht mehr vermittelt, sondern der wird gezwungen, in die Fr\u00fchrente zu gehen, damit der rausf\u00e4llt \naus dem Job. Und das hat aber zur Folge, wenn der in die Fr\u00fchrente geht, dass er nat\u00fcrlich so und so viel Prozent weniger Rente \nbekommt. Und wenn er eh schon, sage ich mal, wenig Rente, was ja, was ja jetzt verst\u00e4rkt da ist, dann ist es noch weniger.\u201c\n1224 ET1: 81 \u201coder kenne selber aus dem pers\u00f6nlichen Umfeld ganz viele Personen, man kann sehr schnell in so eine Situation kommen, \u00e4hm, man muss nur mal l\u00e4ngere Zeit krank sein, \u00e4h, nicht arbeiten k\u00f6nnen, was wei\u00df ich, obwohl man vielleicht n guten Job \nhatte, gut bezahlt, kann jeder, (...) irgendwann is Verm\u00f6gen aufgebraucht und ich glaube nicht, \u00e4h, dass sich jede Person davon \nfreisprechen kann, irgendwann in diese Situation zu kommen.\u201c \n1.3    No knowledge / no opinion\n1.3.1 No knowledge / no opinion\n(Participants stated that they just didn\u2019t know anything on the discussed topic or that they had no, or a \u201cneutral\u201d opinion towards it)\n1311 ET1: 59 \u201cJa, dann mach ich mal gleich weiter. \u00c4hm, ich muss gleich vorwegziehen, ich habe keinerlei Erfahrungen gemacht mit dem \nJobcenter, weder positive, noch negative.\u201c\n1312 ET1: 61 \u201eIch w\u00fcrde mich einfach mit der 5 zufrieden geben, vollkommen neutral, weil wie gesagt, ich keine pers\u00f6nlichen Erfahrungen \njemacht habe und das nur vom H\u00f6rensagen kenne.\u201c \n1313 ET1: 115 \u201c \u00c4hm, das Jobcenter ist f\u00fcr mich weitestgehend unbekanntes Revier, da habt ihr mich son bisschen auf dem falschen Fu\u00df erwischt.\u201c \n1314 MIX1: 25 \u201e Wenn man halt so im Detail \u00fcber Hartz IV nicht so genau Bescheid wei\u00df, wie soll man das dann einordnen? Weil ich k\u00f6nne jetzt zum Beispiel sagen. Ich wei\u00df nicht, ob zu Hartz IV geh\u00f6rt, wenn jemand zum Beispiel Ausl\u00e4nder ist und Hartz IV be-\nkommt und Kinder hat, aber nicht in Deutschland sind, sondern noch in der Heimat. L\u00e4uft das unter Kindergeld und ist das \nunabh\u00e4ngig von Hartz IV oder ist oder ist das Hartz IV? Also das kann ich nicht zum Beispiel. Deswegen k\u00f6nnte ich das nicht einsch\u00e4tzen, ob das jetzt gerecht oder ungerecht ist, weil ich nicht wei\u00df, wie es ist.\u201c \n1315 MIX1: 106 \u201eAlso ich habe ja ein Fragezeichen in die Mitte gepackt, weil ich muss ganz ehrlich sagen. Ich kenne mich mit Hartz IV nicht aus.\u201c \n1316 EL1: 193 \u201eAlso ich habe ganz die Mitte versucht zu treffen. Weil ich es schlicht nicht wei\u00df.\u201c \n1217 ET1: 187 \u201e\u00c4h, ich w\u00fcrde mich in der Mitte verorten, weil ich glaube, dass, also, pauschal so zu beurteilen, ist total schwer, weil da ganz \nviele Aspekte drin sind, die teilweise gerecht und teilweise ungerecht sind.\u201cAPPENDIX293\nSOZIOLOGIEMAGAZIN F\u00f6rdern und Fordern9.2 Summary Tables\n9.2.1 Subjective Knowledge\nVariable Obs Mean Std.

There is not \na very high correlation between general subjective knowledge and school education in years ( = 0.14). Other than the results from subjective knowledge, there are differences in factual knowledge when it comes to school education. From a descriptive perspec-\ntive it seems that there is a relationship between the two variables because none of the \nparticipants without a high school degree (n = 9) provided any of the correct factual information, while all of the persons who answered both questions correctly (n = 6) had at least a high school degree. A Spearman\u2019s correlation was run to assess the relationship \nbetween factual knowledge and education. There was a moderate negative correlation \nbetween factual knowledge and education, which was statistically significant  = -0.53, p = 0.0045, confirming what the descriptive results already indicated. The results indicate \nthat as education increases, the size of overestimation decreases (factual knowledge is \nmore accurate) and vice versa. This correlation does not mathematically prove a causal \nrelationship, even though one can assume from a theoretical perspective that it is more \nprobable that more high school education leads to more factual knowledge about the welfare state than the other way around. Since a simple correlation test does not control \nfor other variables, there could also be a third factor influencing both, school education \nand factual knowledge.", "language": "PDF", "image": "PDF", "pagetype": "PDF", "links": "PDF"}
