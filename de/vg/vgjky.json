I have no words to describe my sound healing experience with Laura. It was incredible. It was my first time taking a private lesson and I was blown away! I am a marathon runner who is currently getting over a stress fracture. Laura completely tailored the session to support that area and focused on the root chakra. I was able to feel the vibrations all over my body and pictured how all the cells of my bones were regenerating. It was an incredible experience that I cannot fully explain. You need to try it for yourself and experience your own personal journey.\n- Brennan BI recently had the pleasure of attending Laura's sound healing class, and I must say it was an extraordinary experience. Laura's classes are truly one of a kind, and every session feels like a magical journey. From the moment I arrived, I felt a sense of calm and tranquility. Laura's warm and welcoming energy immediately put me at ease. The class itself was a beautiful blend of sound and relaxation techniques, designed to promote healing and rejuvenation. The sounds of the various instruments, including crystal bowls, chimes and drums, were incredibly soothing and transported me to a deeply relaxed state. I could feel the stress and tension melting away as the vibrations of the sound washed over me. What sets Laura's classes apart is her ability to create a safe and supportive environment that allows for a truly transformative experience. I left the class feeling refreshed, recharged, and renewed. If you're looking for a unique and powerful healing experience, I highly recommend a...\n- Jenifer PI\u2019ve been to more than one sound healing experience and by far Laura\u2019s session was the best one!
