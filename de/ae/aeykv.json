The study provides a legal and political \nscience perspective to anchoring RE more strongly at the international level. We assess how public \ninternational law and other international governance mechanisms could be used more effectively to \nincrease RE and reduce resource consumption along the value chain. The scope includes abiotic \nresources such as metals, sand, gravel, potassium salts, quartz sand, and fossil raw materials. \nOur stocktake of existing international governance provides a mixed picture: RE is on the international \nagenda, but it is hardly addressed by clear guidance or binding standards. Political initiatives and non-\nbinding mechanisms mostly use recommendations and high-level political statements with strategic \npriorities. Non-state governance approaches include mainly reporting and other information and \nmanagement tools regarding products and production processes.  \nThe second part develops policy options and recommendations to strengthen international \ngovernance of resource efficiency. While the existing non-binding processes and mechanisms such as \nin the G20 could be strengthened, binding options could show a new level of commitment and also \nbetter contribute to more certainty and a level playing field. Mid- to long-term, the existing political \nsupport for RE might be increased and translated into a potential treaty framework. The annex \nincludes an outline for a framework treaty text on resource efficiency. \n \n \nKurzbeschreibung \nAuf Grundlage einer Bestandsaufnahme der bestehenden internationalen Governance von \nRessourceneffizienz (RE) stellen wir Optionen zu ihrer Verbesserung auf kurze, mittlere und lange \nSicht vor. Die Studie bietet eine rechts- und politikwissenschaftliche Perspektive zur st\u00e4rkeren \nVerankerung von RE auf internationaler Ebene. Wir bewerten, wie das V\u00f6lkerrecht und andere \ninternationale Governance-Mechanismen wirksamer genutzt werden k\u00f6nnten, um RE zu erh\u00f6hen und \nden Ressourcenverbrauch entlang der Wertsch\u00f6pfungskette zu reduzieren. Der Anwendungsbereich \numfasst abiotische Ressourcen wie Metalle, Sand, Kies, Kaliumsalze, Quarzsand und fossile Rohstoffe. \nUnsere Bestandsaufnahme der bestehenden internationalen Governance ergibt ein gemischtes Bild: \nRE steht auf der internationalen Agenda, aber es gibt kaum klare Leitlinien oder verbindliche \nStandards. Politische Initiativen und rechtlich nicht verbindliche Mechanismen nutzen meist \nEmpfehlungen und hochrangige politische Erkl\u00e4rungen zu strategischen Priorit\u00e4ten. Nicht-staatliche \nGovernance-Ans\u00e4tze umfassen haupts\u00e4chlich die Berichterstattung und andere Informations- und \nManagementinstrumente in Bezug auf Produkte und Produktionsprozesse.  \nDer zweite Teil entwickelt politische Optionen und Empfehlungen zur St\u00e4rkung der internationalen \nGovernance der Ressourceneffizienz. W\u00e4hrend die bestehenden rechtlich nicht verbindlichen Prozesse \nund Mechanismen z.B. im Rahmen der G20 gest\u00e4rkt werden k\u00f6nnten, k\u00f6nnten verbindliche Optionen \nein neues Ma\u00df an Verbindlichkeit zeigen und auch besser zu mehr Sicherheit und gleichen \nWettbewerbsbedingungen beitragen. Mittel- bis langfristig k\u00f6nnte die bestehende politische \nUnterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr RE verst\u00e4rkt und letztlich eventuell in einen vertraglichen Rahmen \u00fcbertragen \nwerden. Der Anhang enth\u00e4lt eine Skizze f\u00fcr einen Rahmenvertragstext zur Ressourceneffizienz.

Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n17 Summary \nThis report explores whether and how existing international environmental law and governance \naddress resource efficiency (RE), and options for anchoring RE at the international level, including \nelements of a potential treaty.  \nFor the purpose of this study we loosely define resource efficiency as the relation of a certain use or \nresult to the deployment of the natural resources necessary to achieve this use or result. We focus on \nabiotic resources and include the whole value chain except environmental and social standards at the \nextraction stage. \nWe first take stock of and assess existing instruments in existing international law and governance. A \nbroad understanding of international governance includes binding as well as non-binding instruments, \nprocesses and steering mechanisms that are relevant for RE at the international level. Resource \nefficiency is now on the international agenda, for example at the Rio+20 Conference 2012, the \nSustainable Development Goals, the G7 and the G20, which launched a Resource Efficiency Dialogue. \nWhile taking this into account, we focus on the international legal framework. The analysis includes \nselected treaties, customary law and principles of international law based on a presumptive screening \nof their potential relevance for resource efficiency or reduction of resource consumption. The scope of \nthis study does not include the Basel Convention. We also do not include the WTO and bilateral \ninvestment agreements. Other elements of the international legal framework are not legally binding in \nthe strict sense, but as so-called \u201csoft law\u201d nonetheless influence or provide guidance to states\u2019 \nconduct.  \nWe then develop options for improving governance, beginning with an assessment of governance \nproposals in academic literature, followed by our suggested specific policy options and recommenda-\ntions. \nStocktake and assessment of the current international governance of resource efficiency \nInternational law is created differently from national or EU law and has different enforcement \nmechanisms. It is traditionally based on sovereignty of states, as reflected in the principle of \npermanent sovereignty over natural resources. The rise of environmental concerns since the early \n1970s has been reflected in new environmental treaties and greening of existing treaties, as well as in \ncustomary obligations and general concepts that influence political discourse and governance \nframework. They balance and limit sovereignty, based on the interests of other states or matters \nconsidered to be in the common interest of all states. \nCustomary law and principles \nIn addition to treaties, customary law is a source of international law binding upon states. In order to \nestablish a norm of customary law, there has to be evidence that there is sufficient state practice \nadhering to that rule, and that states accept it as legally binding. In many cases states, stakeholders or \nacademics may argue that a norm is already customary law, while others may argue that the existing \nstate practice is not sufficient or that there is no conclusive evidence that states, even if they adhere to \nit in practice, accept to be legally bound.  There are also concepts and norms that are labelled or \ninvoked as \u201cprinciples\u201d, but neither terminology nor international practice in this regard are uniform \nor agreed.  \nThe main customary rules and principles with potential relevance for RE include: \n\u25ba Permanent sovereignty over natural resources \n\u25ba Equitable utilisation of shared natural resources \n\u25ba Common heritage of mankind \n\u25ba Common concern of humankind \n\u25ba Prevention of transboundary environmental harm FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n18 \u25ba Sustainable Development \n\u25ba Inter-generational equity \n\u25ba Polluter pays principle \n\u25ba Precautionary principle \n\u25ba Common but differentiated responsibility \n\u25ba State responsibility \nSome principles, such as sustainable development, serve as a counterweight to the sovereign right to \nexploit natural resources and as an argument that there is a limit to this right. But they do not on their \nown provide concrete normative content or political opportunities specifically for resource efficiency. \nHowever, they could be used to strengthen strategies and arguments involving other principles. \nThe legal obligations to prevent transboundary environmental harm, to carry out an environmental \nimpact assessment and to be legally responsible for breaches of such obligations are conceptually \nbased on notions of environmental harm and attribution that pose significant difficulties for \naddressing resource efficiency. \nSome principles such as equitable utilisation of shared natural resources contain, at least generally, the \nnotion that states have to use resources in a way that enables other states to use that resource as well. \nHowever, state practice on transboundary mineral deposits shows that the principle is exclusively \nconcerned with the allocation of the resources or the profits. It hardly addresses the conservation \naspect over time. This also applies to the concept of common heritage of mankind, which goes further \nas it places the exploitation of certain resources under common management. \nThe principle of common concern of humankind differs from other principles relating to natural \nresources in that it does not focus on allocation, but expresses the common interest of all states in \nenvironmental protection with regard to that concern. This approach could provide political \nopportunities, for instance if states regarded the conservation of resources over time as a common \nconcern irrespective of a certain area. \nApplying the polluter pays principle or the precautionary principle, as they currently stand, to \nresource efficiency also poses difficulties, besides their unsettled legal status in international law. \nUsing the polluter pays principle to address inefficiency, either directly or by analogy, would mean \nthat inefficiency would be treated as contributing to environmental harm, that an inefficient user \nwould be treated like a \u201cpolluter\u201d, and that the environmental costs caused by the inefficiency would \nbe internalised. The underpinnings of the precautionary principle aim at addressing scientific \nuncertainty about environmental impacts, which is of little relevance to resource efficiency unless it \nwere to be interpreted as also including a conservation element.  \nGenerally, customary law and proposed principles and concepts do not provide much established \nnormative guidance with regard to resource efficiency. An apparent impediment for anchoring \nresource efficiency is that it is difficult to define the environmental impact of inefficiency and include it \nin the existing concepts. For instance, when would resource use be so inefficient as to amount to \nenvironmental harm or to a legally unacceptable depletion of resources for future use? Such legal and \nconceptual uncertainties have to be taken into account.  \nTreaties \nTreaties apply only to those States that are Party to them. Treaty regimes with permanent institutions \nfrequently adopt decisions which are usually not binding in the strict legal sense but are in practice \ntreated and complied with by the parties as the agreed rules for implementing the treaty. \nThe treaties with potential relevance for RE included in our assessment are: \n\u25ba London Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes \nand other Matter FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n19 \u25ba UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) \n\u25ba Minamata Convention on Mercury \n\u25ba Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer  \n\u25ba Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants \n\u25ba Paris Agreement on climate change \n\u25ba Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities \n\u25ba International Study Groups on Lead and Zinc, Nickel, and Copper \n\u25ba Sixth International Tin Agreement \n\u25ba Bilateral Resource Agreements between the Federal Republic of Germany and Kazakhstan, the \nMongolia, and Peru. \nThese treaties differ widely in subject matter and regulatory technique. Specifically with regard to \nresource efficiency, they differ e.g. with regard to which part of the value chain they address, whether \nthey address specific resources, and how they affect resource efficiency.  \nFor instance, the deep seabed regime under UNCLOS directly regulates all mineral resources in a \nspecific geographical area at the very beginning of the value chain. Its objective is to distribute the \nopportunities for revenue and there are no incentives for using the resource more efficiently after \nextraction. There is also little indication that it intends to limit the amounts extracted in order to \npreserve supplies over time. However, the strict and detailed extraction management, including \nenvironmental rules, could provide an incentive to use these resources more efficiently. \nThe London Protocol affects all resources by regulating the very end of the value chain, i.e. by creating \neconomic incentives to generate less waste and to recycle more. The main regulatory technique is \nprohibiting certain (cheap) ways of disposing waste. \nThe Minamata Convention on Mercury directly regulates one specific resource - mercury- along the \nwhole value chain. Its objective is not to use mercury more efficiently, but to stop producing and using \nit altogether. But it provides a toolbox of different regulatory techniques for using less mercury, both \nduring the phase-out and for the ban. \nGermany\u2019s three bilateral resource treaties explicitly address resource efficiency, albeit the actual \nobligations are few and remain abstract. It is the host country that is to improve resource efficiency, \nnot the country seeking access to more resources. The clear normative focus of the agreements is to \nfacilitate access to resources, while resource efficiency has minimal weight in comparison.  \nThe Montreal Protocol and the Stockholm Convention regulate specific substances which are not \nabiotic resources. They provide an incentive for resource efficiency only if substituting the regulated \nsubstance does not use the same amount of resources. The regulatory techniques are interesting \nbecause they include trade restrictions that also apply to non-parties. They are also designed to \nrespond to new challenges flexibly and comparatively fast. \nThe Paris Agreement addresses activities related to climate change, notably greenhouse gas emissions \nand to some extent sinks, towards the objective of a collective global temperature limit. It does not \nregulate specific activities, substances or resources, but it potentially affects all resources that \ncontribute to climate change. According to the current state of scientific knowledge, the goals of the \nParis Agreement can only be achieved if the use of fossil fuels is drastically reduced in the medium \nterm and phased out or completely balanced by about 2050. However, the Paris Agreement contains \nmainly procedural obligations which leave parties much discretion to define which individual \nmeasures they want to take towards the collective goals. The potential substitution effects of the \ntransition to a low-carbon economy are difficult to fully assess at this stage.  \nThe International Metal Study Groups specifically address four abiotic resources worldwide: lead, zinc, \nnickel and copper. Their regulatory approach is to influence decision-makers by providing information FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n20 on supply and demand and other market developments. They mention resource efficiency, but it is not \nclear to what extent this actually promotes or enables resource efficiency. \nThe mandate of the Common Fund for Commodities includes all abiotic resources that qualify as \ntradable commodities. Its regulatory technique today is mainly financing commodity development \nprojects. These include projects that promote resource efficiency. The CFC currently appears to move \naway from addressing abiotic resources. \nThe International Tin Agreement can provide relevant insights although it has been terminated after \nthe International Tin Council went insolvent. It exclusively addressed tin and had a high impact on \nresource efficiency because its mandate was to maintain price stability through market interventions \nsuch as buying and selling tin in the market and obligatory floor and ceiling prices. It also used \nfinancial tools, notably borrowing, in order to finance its activities. One lesson learned is that if such \ninstruments are to be used at all, they should be clearly mandated and controlled so as to avoid the \nfinancial risks that eventually led to the Tin Agreement\u2019s demise. \nNone of the treaties assessed address resource efficiency explicitly, with the exception of Germany\u2019s \nbilateral resource treaties with Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Peru. It is interesting that these agreements \naim at improving resource efficiency in the host country rather than addressing Germany as the \ncountry seeking improved access. The few other instances in which efficiency is mentioned refer to e.g. \nefficient extraction, but not efficiency in the sense of a sparing use of the resource.  \nThe treaties have effects on different aspects of resource efficiency: One aspect is whether the \nintention of resource efficiency is to use the resource as long as possible rather than not at all. From \nthis perspective, a ban on using the resource would be resource conserving but not resource efficient \nin a narrow sense, because the resource may not be used at all. The phasing out and ban of mercury \nunder the Minamata Convention provides an example, as well as the (not explicit but necessary) \nphasing out of fossil fuels under the Paris Agreement. An eventual normative or factual ban can \nprovide a strong incentive to use the resources more efficiently until the ban applies, but this effect is \nnot inevitable. \nA different aspect is whether the objective is to increase efficiency for a particular resource or for a \nparticular activity, i.e. reducing its overall resource footprint. Again, the Minamata Convention is an \nexample of addressing one particular resource. In contrast, the deep seabed regime seeks to avoid \nwasteful extraction for all (mineral) resources. \nPerhaps with the exception of direct market intervention in the Tin Agreement model, there is no \nparticular regulatory approach that would appear to be irrelevant or that should be disregarded from \nthe outset with regard to addressing resource efficiency. Existing approaches address the beginning as \nwell as the end of the value chain, a particular resource or all resources in an area, some use specific \nmeasures such as trade restrictions or licensing regimes while others set an objective and follow a \nprocedural approach. Some of the treaties such as the Minamata Convention and the Paris Agreement \nare relatively new and their impact remains to be seen. The diversity of approaches means that \npolitical opportunities for addressing resource efficiency have to be assessed in the context of the \nparticular agreement rather than in abstract.  \nAlthough the treaty obligations potentially have more impact on resource efficiency, by and large they \nshow a picture similar to customary law and emerging principles: International environmental law \nmainly addresses activities with direct physical impacts on the environment. With the exception \nperhaps of waste, it barely touches upon environmental consequences caused by inefficient use of \nresources. Where it does, the existing rules are mainly designed to ensure that resources are available \nor generate revenue.  FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n21 International political processes and legally non-binding mechanisms \nA number of international political processes and legally non-binding mechanisms (\u201cinstruments\u201d) \npromoting resource efficiency have emerged in the past years. Agenda-setting for RE has significantly \nadvanced.  \nIn terms of their steering mechanisms, the instruments are most often high-level political statements \nwith strategic priorities and guidance \u2013 i.e. non-binding recommendations and joint frameworks of \naction. In some cases, these are combined with a small capacity building component or \u201cmeans of \nimplementation\u201d for developing countries (e.g. UNEP GEI and GI REC, the New Urban Agenda). Also, \nvarious instruments are linked with knowledge dissemination through the exchange of best practice \nbetween countries, learning forums, or pilot projects. The International Resource Panel provides a \nbasis for creating new scientific knowledge (such as assessments of policy options with regard to their \neffects on resource efficiency)1 and feeding it into the policy debate. It is a valuable mechanism for \nfostering a common understanding of issues related to RE, their drivers and potential solutions. A \nrelatively new governance mechanism is \u201cgoverning through goals\u201d2, as embodied by the SDGs. This \napproach leaves leeway to countries to operationalise the attainment of (quantified) goals and \nmonitors goal attainment, although it is typically not combined with sanctions if goals are missed. An \ninteresting governance mechanism is the World Bank\u2019s and IFC\u2019s sustainability standards for country \nborrowers and private sector clients, which are binding to the extent that they become part of lending \nand support conditions, though capacity building (of all parties), monitoring and enforcement still \nprovide challenges. \nIn most cases, the instruments address all UN member states, with an implicit focus on developing \ncountries and emerging economies, as OECD countries have progressed somewhat further in the \ndirection of resource efficiency policies. The SGDs are an exception, since they explicitly also address \ndeveloped countries to speed up their efforts. Also, the OECD, G7/8 and G20 have committed to further \npromoting resource efficiency. \nMost of the instruments address the complete value chain, i.e. they do not specify any particular \nsegments of the value chain (or any particular sectors) in which resource efficiency should be \nenhanced, though a few are focused on extraction, others on waste and the 3Rs. The intermediate \nsegments of the value chain are rarely addressed explicitly.  \nWe can distinguish at least three different pathways of effects: some instruments directly fund \nresource efficiency projects (e.g., UNEP GEI); others fund resource-consuming projects but require \nsome attention to resource efficiency (World Bank/ IFC safeguards); most instruments affect resource \nefficiency more indirectly by defining resource efficiency goals (SDGs, 10YFP, UNEP GEI, OECD Green \nGrowth Strategy etc.) or by stimulating (and partly funding the development of) specific resource \nefficiency policies (Kobe 3R Action Plan). \nAssessing the instruments\u2019 effectiveness is difficult in terms of showing that they caused governments \nto re-direct, adapt or change their policies. There are only few in-depth evaluations and reviews on the \n(partly still new) instruments, with the exception of, inter alia, the UNEP Green Economy Initiative and \nthe G8 Kobe 3R Action Plan. Due to obvious methodological difficulties, none of the existing \nevaluations traces causation from international initiatives to country-level changes in resource \nconsumption. This analysis was also beyond the scope of this study. On a more generic level, it seems \nthat while there are plenty of policies, forums and platforms, some of these have a short life span and \nlittle follow-up. The World Bank Groups\u2019 lending conditionalities are relatively strong instruments \nbecause they are binding on borrowers and clients. However, they affect only developing countries \nand actors, which also raises the issue of double standards. Also, it is unclear to what extent \n \n1 See, for instance, IRP (2017b). \n2 Kanie et al. (2017). FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n22 specifically those conditionalities that are relevant for resource efficiency actually have an impact on \nproject design and implementation. Using proxies for effectiveness such as the instruments\u2019 specificity \nin terms of commitment, their political weight and institutional design and substructures, most \ninstruments are relatively unspecific, have only moderate political clout, often feature insignificant \ninternational budgets and no systematic review mechanisms. This holds for those instruments that are \npart of UN Programmes (UNEP GEI & GI REC) and for strategy documents of multilateral groupings \n(OECD, G20, G8/7). UN initiatives adopted or endorsed by the General Assembly (SDGs, the New Urban \nAgenda, 10YFP) tend to have a broader basis of legitimacy, but have review mechanisms with varying \ndegrees of stringency. The SDGs presently seem to be the instrument with the best prerequisites to \ninduce change in political practices. \nHowever, the available analyses are sobering: despite past political efforts and economic innovation \nthat promote resource efficiency, rebound effects and generic economic growth overall outweigh the \nefficiency gains. This indicates that a new chapter should be discussed: that of the absolute reductions \nin resource consumption (resource sufficiency). Here, the agenda setting process has barely started at \nthe international level. \nNon-state governance approaches \nThe relevance of non-state government approaches for resource efficiency differs considerably. While \nsome will only have indirect effects, others impact resource use directly. Reporting standards like the \nGRI or the KPIs for ESG might have indirect effects by making resource use by companies transparent. \nThe same can be said for LCAs at product level. Other standards use targets to generate a direct \nimpact. E.g. EMAS\u2019 requirement to set specific targets on resource consumption will support \ncompanies in reducing the use of resources when applying the management system. Another initiative \nwhich pro-vides specific targets regarding resource efficiency is the Zero Waste International Alliance. \nType I eco-labels as well as the GRS have direct impact by certifying certain aspects of resource \nefficiency for spe-cific products. \nRegarding the institutional setting, most of the initiatives are based on multi-stakeholder networks \nand include actors from business, civil society or other institutions like standard setting agencies. The \ndegree of influence among the groups, however, differs considerably, businesses being the most influ-\nential stakeholder in many cases. In some cases state actors also play a relevant role in supporting the \ncreation as well as the diffusion of the respective initiative. \nThe addressees of most of the analysed initiatives are companies. The instruments either refer to cor-\nporate processes/ management or to companies\u2019 products and services. The ZWIA is an exception be-\ncause it also addresses municipalities and the civil society. \nIn terms of steering mechanism, all initiatives apply information tools. Additionally, capacity building \nor cooperative instruments are used by some. Nearly all of the initiatives have review processes for \ntheir standards in place. In the case of the GRI or the German eco-label \u201cBlauer Engel\u201d, these are highly \nformalized and standardised mechanisms with clearly defined time frames and specific institutions \nassigned with the implementation of the review. In most other cases, review proesses are more \ninformal. \nThe degree of diffusion differs strongly between the standards and initiatives. While some initiatives, \nsuch as the GRI, have managed to become globally applied standards that set a benchmark even \nthough they are voluntary in nature, others (like the GRS or GeSI) are limited in their geographical or \nsectoral application and therefore impact. \nOverarching assessment  \nThe stocktake provides a mixed picture : Recent non-binding approaches show that resource \nefficiency has been included on the international political agenda. The SDGs and the G20 are different \nprocess but both high-level and with political weight and legitimacy. Although in the past, both FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n23 processes had in some cases problems with sustaining political momentum and achieving concrete \nresults, they are at relatively early stages with regard to resource efficiency and could still provide \npotential political opportunities.  \nYet there are virtually no binding standards for resource efficiency. International law and emerging \nprinciples and concepts for the most part do not address resource efficiency directly in terms of \nresources used per unit of output. There are a few general references to efficiency in bilateral resource \ntreaties and the seabed regime, but so far they have been more focused on facilitating extraction and \nallocating the resources. \nOne reason might be that so far states found it easier to agree on environmental obligations with \nregard to traditional environmental impacts. There are also conceptual difficulties  in applying the \nexisting norms and concepts to the environmental impacts caused by inefficiency. The environmental \nimpacts of inefficiency are caused less directly than \u201cusual\u201d environmental impacts and difficult to \nascertain. Another aspect could be that resource efficiency brings environmental concerns to process \nand product standards and competitiveness, an issue which is addressed by international trade rules. \nThe WTO system, which we did not specifically address, has rules on process and product standards, \nalthough these do not require resource efficiency but instead determine to what extent states may be \npermitted  to set such standards. States might be reluctant to consider binding rules in this area in \norder to avoid problems with trade rules. A further impediment could be that resource efficiency \nstandards, unless they remain fairly abstract, would entail technical requirements that are highly \nspecific to individual production processes and would therefore be difficult to negotiate as well as to \nkeep up to date.  \nOnly indirectly, binding international law provides some incentives to improve resource efficiency. \nThe most relevant links in binding instruments are resource conservation aspects and treaties \nconcerning waste. Both resource conservation and recovery are inherent parts of the circular economy \nof wastes. Regulatory approaches that involved direct market interventions, such as the tin agreement, \nhave been abandoned. Indirect links in customary international law and emerging or proposed \noverarching principles are difficult to assess because their legal status, normative content, or both are \noften unclear or abstract.  \nAs for political processes and non-binding mechanisms , recommendations are most frequent type, \noften in the form of high-level political statements with strategic priorities and guidance, and often \naccompanied by joint frameworks of action. In addition, there are several relevant programs by \ninternational organizations, the International Resource Panel as a science-policy interface, and project \nlending standards by the World Bank Group that address resource efficiency. Many of the instruments \nare relatively unspecific, have only moderate political output and feature insignificant institutional \nembedding and international budgets. The SDGs are an exception, as they specify resource efficiency \ngoals and abstract targets, combined with a political monitoring mechanism. At least at present, they \nalso have political weight and momentum. The newly established G20\u2019s dialogue could also generate \npolitical buy-in.  \nNon-state governance approaches  include mainly reporting and other information and management \ntools regarding products and production processes. Their steering impact is mainly based on informal \nmarket incentives. Product certification schemes can involve criteria that are directly linked to \nresource efficiency like longevity or repairability.  \nFrom an institutional perspective , some institutions have the potential to address resource \nefficiency directly or indirectly. The regular meeting of the Conference of the Parties of several \nmultilateral environmental agreements may include resource efficiency in their agenda, and the \nInternational Seabed Authority provides for a strict extraction management of mineral resources in \nthe deep seabed that may provide incentives to use resources more efficiently. The World Bank\u2019s \nEnvironmental and Social Standards and the IFC\u2019s performance standards include resource efficiency FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n24 in a general manner and subject to a number of caveats such as technical and financial feasibility. \nThese standards are a special case as they are made binding between the financing institution and the \nrecipients. \nWhile at first sight international non-binding and non-governmental approaches are more specific \nthan binding ones, they are mostly reporting and management tools with varying degrees of specificity \nregarding resource use. Even in this area, few non-state standards specifically address resource \nefficiency in the sense of actually quantifying a permitted amount of material per output. \nThere is no clear link or discernible deliberate division of labour between binding and non-binding or \nother approaches. So far neither non-binding political initiatives nor other non-state and approaches \nrelating to resource efficiency appear to have spurred the development of binding obligations. \nHowever, this does not exclude from the outset using existing non-binding approaches to either build \npolitical will in this regard, show feasibility or serve as a model. \n \nPolicy options for strengthening resource efficiency in international governance \n \nInternational law \nBased on the assessment of existing international law with regard to resource efficiency, we suggest \nseveral options for anchoring RE more firmly in legally binding commitments at the international \nlevel.  \n\u25ba A treaty on resource efficiency? At this stage we do not recommend pursuing a new standalone \ntreaty on RE, even if it was merely a general framework treaty. The political effort that would be \nrequired at this stage to create support for international legal obligations on regarding RE appears \nsubstantial. Although resource efficiency is a widely accepted objective, including in the SGDs, it is \na significant step from being politically supportive and to becoming party to a binding instrument. \nMid-to long-term: One option is to work towards building the political conditions for anchoring RE \nin international law. The discussion in the context of international fora such as the G7 Alliance for \nResource Efficiency, G20 Dialogue on Resource Efficiency, the OECD etc. could gradually be \nbrought to consider mutual benefits of an international RE treaty, for instance in the form of a \ngeneral framework treaty. Besides a stand-alone treaty, there is also the option of a new \ninstrument under an existing treaty (e.g. a \u201cProtocol\u201d).  \nPotentially Long-term: While binding rules are not an end in itself, the idea of a general, not too \nprescriptive treaty could focus existing international political initiatives. A binding treaty ideally \nmeans a high level of long-term commitment both at the international as well as at the national \nlevel. With regard to political feasbility, it should be noted that a treaty can address different issues \ndifferently, more or less prescriptively and precisely, and it can leave flexibility for parties in order \nto facilitate buy-in and implementation over time. Since RE encompasses a broad range resources \nand diverse approaches, it could be useful to consider starting with a framework structure that \nenvisages subsequent amendments for particular resources or issues, e.g. in annexes or protocols. \nEven if the legal obligations as such were initially more of a framework nature, a treaty could \nanchor RE on the agenda and establish a permanent forum to progressively address it. It could \ninclude mandates for further work and permanent institutions such as the usual Conference of \nParties (COP) which adopts decisions to specify and guide parties' implementation. In order to be \nprepared in the long run, we provide an outline of potential of treaty provisions as food for \nthought in Annex 2. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n25 Leverage for RE: A treaty would address states (and the EU) who would have to implement its \nobligations in their respective national jurisdictions. Depending on the treaty\u2019s specific content, it \nwould be overarching and cross-cutting, with genral obligations that could be elaborated over time \nin annexes for specific sectors, resources etc. \n\u25ba A treaty on plastic as a test case.  Instead of a treaty on resource efficiency, a new treaty on a \nmore narrowly defined issue such as plastic could serve as a test case and model for eventually \naddressing RE more generally.  \nFor instance, a treaty on plastic waste could build on the political attention to this issue and \naddress gaps in the existing international governance. It could allow for taking a broader \nperspective than waste and address the complete life cycle of plastics and issues such as extended \nproducer responsibility, which are important issues for resource efficiency in general. This could \nbe an opportunity to try out international governance on a specific issue for which there already is \nbroad existing political support. However, at this stage it is not clear whether this political \nattention could be translated into a willingness to commit to binding obligations. \n\u25ba Interpret the polluter pays principle  and existing customary law in terms of resource efficiency. \nLong-term, Germany could work towards establishing and interpreting existing customary law in a \nway that includes aspects of RE. For instance, it could develop and support an expanded legal \ninterpretation of the fairly established polluter pays principle by which inefficient resource use \nwould qualify as \u201cpolluting\u201d and actors using resources inefficiently would be regarded as \n\u201cpolluters\u201d who should bear the costs caused by the inefficiency. It could also be considered \nwhether the rationale behind concepts such as \"safe operating space\" and \"planetary boundaries\" \ncan feed into further developing other existing legal principles and rules at the international level.  \nLeverage for RE: Cross-cutting general obligation on states. \n\u25ba Paris Agreement: Address resource efficiency . Mid-term/long-term: Germany could address \nand promote RE as a topic through the Paris Agreement. The on-going negotiations under the \nclimate offer a range of options for doing so, e.g. from one-off events to regular agenda items, and \nfrom a platform for exchanging information to anchoring normative text in COP decisions. In terms \nof specific issues, options include, inter alia, including RE in NDCs or in reporting formats. \nLeverage for RE: Potentially all relating to climate change, depending on Germany\u2019s preferences \nand opportunities pursued in the climate regime. \n \nPolitical processes, organisations and non-binding mechanisms \nWe identify the following options:  \n\u25ba G20 dialogue : Keep resource efficiency on the agenda and develop further into recommendations \nand action. This might require medium political effort and the shift could be sensitive for some \nmembers.  \nShort-term, medium term: Actively follow-up on the G20 Dialogue on RE and ensure that it is \ncontinued and that RE stays on the G20 agenda.  \nShort-term, medium term: Explore to what extent the existing work under the G7 Alliance for \nResource Efficiency can feed into and be coordinated with the G20.  \nMedium term: Move the G20 Dialogue on RE towards more concrete work and outcomes e.g. by \nsetting goals, definitions, or actions. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n26 Leverage for RE: Defining political targets, strengthening research and improving the knowledge \nbase, promoting resource efficiency in production and consumption  \n\u25ba G7: Continue G7 Alliance  for Resource Efficiency and coordinate with G20 dialogue. \nMid-term: Germany should review progress on the Bologna Roadmap through the G7 and direct it \ntowards more specific plans and actions regarding RE. \nMid-term: Germany should pursue opportunities for co-ordinating the G20 dialogue with the G7 \nAlliance for Resource Efficiency. \nLeverage for RE: Defining political targets, strengthening research and improving the knowledge \nbase, promoting resource efficiency in production and consumption, improving policy coherence. \n\u25ba IRP follow-up : Define and feed in mandate for further work. \nShort and medium term: Germany should support and increase the IRP\u2019s legitimacy as a scientific \nsupporting body. But we do not recommend changing the IRP\u2019s institutional setup or mandate.  \nLeverage for RE: Depending on the specific mandate: Strengthening research and improve the \nknowledge base, promoting resource efficiency in production and consumption; promoting advice \non resource efficiency for companies, the use of environmental management schemes, the \nintegration of resource efficiency in standardization. \n\u25ba IRP to explore potential of international-level policies for resource efficiency, including global \ntaxation. \nThe IRP could be mandated (e.g., by the G20 or the OECD) with a study on potential future \ninternational-level policies for resource efficiency, including the potential design and impacts of a \nglobal system to tax resources. This could be a first step towards future economic instruments that \nprovide incentives for more RE of resources. \nLeverage for RE: improving knowledge base; economic instruments/incentives. \n\u25ba Reporting requirements for companies  regarding resource efficiency. There are opportunities \nto promote RE reporting requirements for companies at the national level e. g. regarding the \nimplementation of the EU directive on non-financial reporting which could be done by introducing \nresource efficiency into the German \u201cSustainability Code\u201d. Also research on appropriate (sector \nspecific) indicators could be commissioned. \nLeverage for RE: promote resource efficiency in production. \n\u25ba Promoting environmental management systems: While the idea to make the implementation of \nenvironmental management systems legally mandatory on an international level might not be \nrelevant yet, different ideas to promote EMAS on the national and EU level like linking it to public \nprocurement or making it mandatory for public institutions could be pursued. \nLeverage for RE: promoting resource efficiency in production (promoting the use of environmental \nmanagement schemes) \n\u25ba UNEP: Strenghtening National Cleaner Production Centres and the global network for Resource \nEfficient and Cleaner Production (RECPnet). The German government could, firstly, provide \nsupport for the UNIDO and UNEP programmes on National Cleaner Production Centres and \nResource Efficient and Cleaner Production (RECP). Secondly, it could promote expanding the \nfinancial basis of the programmes (including the number of donors, e.g. at least all G7 countries). \nAmong others, Germany could provide an own financial contribution. The overall objective of the FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n27 initiative is that NCPCs can be established in further countries and that existing NCPCs can branch \nout to the regional levels.  \nLeverage for RE: Promoting advice on resource efficiency for companies as well as fostering the \ndevelopment and diffusing of resource- and energy-efficient production and treatment processes. \n\u25ba UNEP & UN Habitat \u201cZero Waste Cities\u201d Award  (or: programme/fund). The German government \nmay consider, as part of its Habitat III follow-up activities, the launch of a \u201czero waste cities\u201d \naward. \nLeverage for RE: The initiative would contribute to \u201cstrengthening resource efficiency as a \ncriterion for the retail sector and consumers\u201d, \u201coptimising the collection and recycling of bulk \nwastes\u201d and possibly \u201cintegrating resource efficiency in public procurement\u201d (at the municipal \nlevel). \n\u25ba World Bank and IFC:  Strengthen the anchoring of resource efficiency within the Bank The \nGerman government, with the support of the G7 or G20, should advocate the strengthening of \nresource efficiency as a topic within the different branches of the World Bank. This includes \npromoting (in the medium-term) a systematic review of the implementation and effectiveness of \nthe World Bank\u2019s safeguard policies and the IFC\u2019s performance standards with regard to resource \nefficiency, a broadening of the scope of application of the Safeguards from project financing to \nprogrammatic loans and increased funding for circular economy business models under the IFC. \nLeverage for RE: This would address the development and diffusion of resource- and energy-\nefficient production and treatment processes; promotion of the use of environmental management \nschemes; and innovation though mainstreaming resource efficiency in product design. \n\u25ba OECD: Implementation review of the 2008 OECD Council Recommendation  on Resource \nProductivity. The German government could request the pending evaluation of progress with work \nrelated to the OECD\u2018s Council Recommendation on Resource Productivity.  \nLeverage for RE: The recommendation addresses the lever \u201cimproving the knowledge base\u201d. \n\u25ba Creation of an International Resource Agency . Germany could consider supporting the creation \nof an International Resource Agency in the long term. Launching a new agency would require \nsignificant political efforts.  \nLeverage for RE: Depending on its mandate, establishing an International Resource Agency could \naddress the lever of \u201cstrengthening research and improving the science basis; transfer of \nknowledge\u201d. \n\u25ba Define mid-level goals  on resource efficiency (e.g., in OECD, G20 and potential Framework \nConvention on Resource Efficiency). The German government could stimulate an international \ndebate (in various fora) on the definition of mid-level goals and indicators on resource efficiency. \nThese goals and indicators would be sector and raw material specific and could build a bridge to \neconomy-wide goals and indicators on general resource efficiency. \nLeverage for RE: This option would provide a \u2018meta\u2019 lever for RE. The goals can stimulate action \npromoting resource efficiency in production and consumption as well as fostering a circular \neconomy. Defining goals can also raise public awareness. \n\u25ba Voluntary Country and Company Guiding Principles  on Strengthening Resource Efficiency: \nVoluntary guidelines could be an alternative to a binding treaty on RE. Such guidelines could \naddress both states and the private sector and be the basis for further legal developments. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n28 Leverage for RE: Potentially all levers addressed in the \"ProgRess\" study. \n\u25ba \u201c2% Initiative for Resource Efficiency\u201d  (e.g., UNEA, incl. GEF funding). The German government \ncould promote an international initiative where countries would commit themselves voluntarily to \nincreasing economy-wide resource efficiency by a certain percentage. \nLeverage for RE: The (cross-cutting) lever addressed is \u201cgoal / target setting\u201d, which can stimulate \ndifferent types of concrete RE-promoting action. \n\u25ba Resolution on Extended Producer Responsibility and Eco-design  (e.g., as UNEA Resolution). \nThe German government could organise an international coalition (e.g., in the context of the G20) \nto initiate the process for an international (e.g., UNEA) resolution on Extended Producer \nResponsibility and Eco-design. Such a resolution should motivate industrialised countries to \nupdate and make more ambitious their EPR schemes and support South-South learning in order to \nexpand (and in some cases establish) EPR schemes in the Global South. \nLeverage for RE: The Resolution would address the lever \u201cstrengthening producer responsibility\u201d \nin order to promote a circular economy. \n \n\u25ba Creation of an international (public-private) recycling fund . The German government could \nconsider the creation of an international recycling fund. It would provide economic incentives (e.g. \npre-defined premium payments on pre-defined volumes of soundly recycled waste) in order to \nstimulate environmentally sound recycling in developing countries. \nLeverage for RE: The levers addressed are \u201cstrengthening recycling\u201d as well as \u201cOptimising the \ncollection and recycling of bulk wastes\u201d, with a focus on developing countries. \n\u25ba Country-driven resource-efficient procurement initiative  (e.g., OECD initiative). The German \ngovernment could initiate a country-driven sustainable procurement initiative in which \ngovernments commit to increasing the share of publicly sourced products and services sourced \nthat are resource efficient. \nLeverage for RE: The initiative addresses the lever \u201cintegrating resource efficiency in public \nprocurement\u201d. \n\u25ba G7 \u201cGolden carrot\u201d initiative to internationally promote ecological product design. The \nGerman government could promote the creation of a \u2018Golden Carrot\u2019 initiative to internationally \nstimulate ecological product design in selected product groups. It would be necessary to examine \nwhether a Golden Carrot Programme on resource efficiency was eligible under international \n(WTO) state aid rules.  \nLeverage for RE: The initiative addresses the lever \u201cInnovation though mainstreaming resource \nefficiency in product design\u201d. \n \nNon-state and other governance approaches:  \n\u25ba Global Multistakeholder Forum on Resource Efficiency : The German government could \npromote the launch of a Global Multistakeholder Forum on Resource Efficiency. In the Forum, \ndifferent industries and stakeholders would collaborate (in material-specific sub-forums) to \ndevelop environmentally and socially sustainable processes to close material flows (secondary \nmaterial supply chains). The Forum could be linked to industry and civil society actors involved in \nthe G20 process and its Resource Efficiency Dialogue. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n29 Leverage for RE: Providing sustainable raw materials, resource efficiency in production, resource \nefficiency in consumption, circular economy. \n \n \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n30 Zusammenfassung \nDiese Studie untersucht, ob und wie das bestehende Umweltv\u00f6lkerrecht und internationale \nGovernance Ressourceneffizienz (RE) behandeln, und sie zeigt Optionen auf f\u00fcr die Verankerung von \nRE auf internationaler Ebene, einschlie\u00dflich der Elemente eines m\u00f6glichen Abkommens.  \nF\u00fcr diese Studie definieren wir Ressourceneffizienz lose als das Verh\u00e4ltnis einer bestimmten Nutzung \noder eines bestimmten Ergebnisses zum Einsatz der nat\u00fcrlichen Ressourcen, die zum Erreichen dieser \nNutzung oder dieses Ergebnisses erforderlich sind. Wir konzentrieren uns auf abiotische Ressourcen \nund beziehen die gesamte Wertsch\u00f6pfungskette mit Ausnahme von Umwelt- und Sozialstandards bei \nder Gewinnung mit ein. \nWir nehmen zun\u00e4chst eine Bestandsaufnahme und Bewertung der bestehenden Instrumente des \ngeltenden V\u00f6lkerrechts und der bestehenden Governance vor. Unser breites Verst\u00e4ndnis von \ninternationaler Governance umfasst sowohl verbindliche als auch nicht verbindliche Instrumente, \nProzesse und Steuerungsmechanismen, die f\u00fcr RE auf internationaler Ebene relevant sind. \nRessourceneffizienz steht mittlerweile auf der internationalen Agenda, z.B. bei der Rio+20-Konferenz \n2012, den Zielen f\u00fcr nachhaltige Entwicklung, der G7 und der G20, die einen Dialog \u00fcber \nRessourceneffizienz ins Leben gerufen haben. Unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung dessen konzentrieren wir uns \nauf den internationalen rechtlichen Rahmen. Die Analyse umfasst ausgew\u00e4hlte v\u00f6lkerrechtliche \nVertr\u00e4ge, Gewohnheitsrecht und v\u00f6lkerrechtliche Grunds\u00e4tze auf der Grundlage einer Pr\u00fcfung ihrer \npotenziellen Relevanz f\u00fcr Ressourceneffizienz oder die Verringerung des Ressourcenverbrauchs. Nicht \nber\u00fccksichtigt werden die WTO und bilaterale Investitionsabkommen. Andere Elemente des \nv\u00f6lkerrechtlichen Rahmens sind zwar nicht rechtsverbindlich im engeren Sinne, beeinflussen jedoch \nals so genanntes \"soft law\" das Verhalten der Staaten oder geben ihnen Orientierungshilfen.  \nWir entwickeln dann Optionen zur Verbesserung der Governance, beginnend mit einer Bewertung von \nVorschl\u00e4gen zur Governance in der wissenschaftlichen Literatur, gefolgt von unseren Vorschl\u00e4gen f\u00fcr \nspezifische politische Optionen und Empfehlungen. \nBestandsaufnahme und Bewertung der bestehenden internationalen Governance von \nRessourceneffizienz  \nDas internationale Recht kommt anders zustande als das nationale oder EU Recht und hat andere \nDurchsetzungsmechanismen. Es basiert traditionell auf der Souver\u00e4nit\u00e4t der Staaten, was sich auch im \nGrundsatz der dauerhaften Souver\u00e4nit\u00e4t \u00fcber nat\u00fcrliche Ressourcen widerspiegelt. Die Zunahme von \nUmweltbelangen seit den fr\u00fchen 1970er Jahren spiegelt sich in neuen Umweltabkommen und der \n\u00d6kologisierung bestehender Abkommen wider, aber auch in gewohnheitsrechtlichen Verpflichtungen \nund allgemeinen Konzepten, die den politischen Diskurs und die Rahmenbedingungen der Governance \nbeeinflussen. Diese Entwicklungen bilden ein Gegengewicht zur Souver\u00e4nit\u00e4t und schr\u00e4nken sie ein, \nauf Grundlage der Interessen anderer Staaten oder Angelegenheiten, die als im gemeinsamen \nInteresse aller Staaten liegend betrachtet werden. \nGewohnheitsrecht und Prinzipien  \nNeben den v\u00f6lkerrechtlichen Vertr\u00e4gen ist das Gewohnheitsrecht eine Quelle des f\u00fcr die Staaten \nverbindlichen V\u00f6lkerrechts. Um eine Gewohnheitsrechtsnorm zu schaffen, muss nachgewiesen \nwerden, dass es eine ausreichende staatliche Praxis gibt, die sich an diese Regel h\u00e4lt, und dass die \nStaaten sie als rechtsverbindlich akzeptieren. In vielen F\u00e4llen m\u00f6gen Staaten, Interessenvertreter oder \ndie Wissenschaft argumentieren, dass eine Norm bereits Gewohnheitsrecht ist, w\u00e4hrend andere \nargumentieren, dass die bestehende staatliche Praxis nicht ausreicht oder dass es keine schl\u00fcssigen \nBeweise daf\u00fcr gibt, dass Staaten, selbst wenn sie sich in der Praxis daran halten, dar\u00fcber hinaus auch \nakzeptieren, rechtlich gebunden  zu sein. Es gibt auch Konzepte und Normen, die als Grunds\u00e4tze oder FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n31 \"Prinzipien\" bezeichnet oder angef\u00fchrt werden, aber weder die Terminologie noch die internationale \nPraxis sind in dieser Hinsicht einheitlich oder vereinbart.  \nZu den wichtigsten gebr\u00e4uchlichen Regeln und Prinzipien mit potentieller Relevanz f\u00fcr RE geh\u00f6ren \n\u25ba Dauerhafte Souver\u00e4nit\u00e4t \u00fcber nat\u00fcrliche Ressourcen \n\u25ba Angemessene Nutzung gemeinsamer nat\u00fcrlicher Ressourcen \n\u25ba Gemeinsames Erbe der Menschheit \n\u25ba Gemeinsames Interesse der Menschheit \n\u25ba Vermeidung grenz\u00fcberschreitender Umweltsch\u00e4den \n\u25ba Nachhaltige Entwicklung \n\u25ba Inter-generationelle Gerechtigkeit  \n\u25ba Verursacherprinzip \n\u25ba Vorsorgeprinzip \n\u25ba Gemeinsame, aber differenzierte Verantwortlichkeit \n\u25ba Staatenverantwortlichkeit. \nEinige Prinzipien, wie die nachhaltige Entwicklung, dienen als Gegengewicht zum souver\u00e4nen Recht, \nnat\u00fcrliche Ressourcen auszubeuten, und als Argument daf\u00fcr, dass es eine Grenze f\u00fcr dieses Recht gibt. \nSie allein bieten jedoch keine konkreten normativen Inhalte oder politischen M\u00f6glichkeiten speziell \nf\u00fcr Ressourceneffizienz. Sie k\u00f6nnten jedoch zur St\u00e4rkung von Strategien und Argumenten genutzt \nwerden, die auch andere Grunds\u00e4tze einbeziehen. \nEs gibt rechtliche Verpflichtungen, grenz\u00fcberschreitende Umweltsch\u00e4den zu verhindern, eine \nUmweltvertr\u00e4glichkeitspr\u00fcfung durchzuf\u00fchren und f\u00fcr Verst\u00f6\u00dfe gegen diese Verpflichtungen \nrechtlich verantwortlich zu sein. Diese Pflichten basieren jedoch konzeptionell auf Begriffen wie \nUmweltsch\u00e4den und Zurechnung, die nicht leicht auf Ressourceneffizienz anwendbar sind. \nEinige Prinzipien, wie z.B. die angemessene Nutzung gemeinsam genutzter nat\u00fcrlicher Ressourcen, \nenthalten zumindest im Allgemeinen die Vorstellung, dass Staaten Ressourcen nur in einer Weise \nnutzen d\u00fcrfen, die es anderen Staaten erm\u00f6glicht, diese Ressourcen ebenfalls zu nutzen. Die staatliche \nPraxis im Fall grenz\u00fcberschreitender Rohstoffvorkommen zeigt jedoch, dass sich in diesem Bereich \ndas Prinzip ausschlie\u00dflich auf die Zuteilung der Ressourcen oder die Gewinne bezieht. Es betrifft kaum \nden Aspekt der langfristigen Ressourcenerhaltung. Dies gilt auch f\u00fcr das Konzept des gemeinsamen \nErbes der Menschheit, das weiter geht, da es die Ausbeutung bestimmter Ressourcen unter eine \ngemeinsame Verwaltung stellt. \nDas Prinzip des gemeinsamen Interesses der Menschheit unterscheidet sich von anderen Prinzipien, \ndie sich auf die nat\u00fcrlichen Ressourcen beziehen, insofern, als es nicht auf die Zuteilung abzielt, \nsondern das gemeinsame Interesse aller Staaten am Umweltschutz zum Ausdruck bringt. Dieser \nAnsatz k\u00f6nnte politische M\u00f6glichkeiten bieten, zum Beispiel wenn Staaten die langfristige Erhaltung \nder Ressourcen unabh\u00e4ngig von einem bestimmten Gebiet als ein gemeinsames Interesse betrachten. \nDie Anwendung des Verursacherprinzips oder des Vorsorgeprinzips in ihrer jetzigen Form auf die \nRessourceneffizienz wirft neben ihrem ungekl\u00e4rten v\u00f6lkerrechtlichen Status ebenfalls Schwierigkeiten \nauf: Wenn man das Verursacherprinzip auf Ineffizienz anwendete, entweder direkt oder durch \nAnalogie, w\u00fcrde man letztlich Ineffizienz als Beitrag zu einer Umweltsch\u00e4digung ansehen, einen \nineffizienten Nutzer daher wie einen \"Verursacher\" behandeln und die durch die Ineffizienz \nverursachten Umweltkosten internalisieren. Die Grundlagen des Vorsorgeprinzips zielen darauf ab, \nmit wissenschaftlicher Unsicherheit bez\u00fcglich Umweltauswirkungen umzugehen. Dies ist aber f\u00fcr \nRessourceneffizienz kaum von Bedeutung - es sei denn, man versteht RE so, dass dazu auch ein \nElement der Ressourcenerhaltung geh\u00f6rt.  \nIm Allgemeinen bieten das Gewohnheitsrecht und die vorgeschlagenen Prinzipien und Konzepte \nwenig allgemein anerkannte normative Orientierung in Bezug auf Ressourceneffizienz. Ein Hindernis FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n32 f\u00fcr die st\u00e4rkere Verankerung von Ressourceneffizienz besteht darin, dass es schwierig ist, die \nUmweltauswirkungen von Ineffizienz zu definieren und RE in die bestehenden Normen und Konzepte \neinzubeziehen. Wann w\u00e4re z.B. eine Ressourcennutzung so ineffizient, dass sie zu einer Sch\u00e4digung \nder Umwelt oder zu einer Aussch\u00f6pfung der Ressourcen f\u00fchren w\u00fcrde, die mit Blick auf eine k\u00fcnftige \nNutzung rechtlich nicht akzeptabel w\u00e4re? Solche rechtlichen und konzeptionellen Unsicherheiten \nm\u00fcssen ber\u00fccksichtigt werden. \nV\u00f6lkerrechtliche Vertr\u00e4ge  \nVertr\u00e4ge gelten nur f\u00fcr die Staaten, die ihnen beigetreten sind. Dar\u00fcber hinaus gibt es in \nVertragsregimen mit st\u00e4ndigen Institutionen h\u00e4ufig Entscheidungen, die in der Regel nicht im engeren \nrechtlichen Sinne bindend sind, aber in der Praxis von den Vertragsparteien als die vereinbarten \nRegeln f\u00fcr die Umsetzung des Vertrags behandelt und eingehalten werden. \nUnsere Bewertung umfasste folgende Vertr\u00e4ge mit potenzieller Relevanz f\u00fcr RE: \n\u25ba Basler \u00dcbereinkommen \u00fcber die Kontrolle der grenz\u00fcberschreitenden Verbringung gef\u00e4hrlicher \nAbf\u00e4lle und ihrer Entsorgung  \n\u25ba Londoner Protokoll zum \u00dcbereinkommen \u00fcber die Verh\u00fctung der Meeresverschmutzung durch \ndas Einbringen von Abf\u00e4llen und anderen Stoffen \n\u25ba UN-Seerechtskonvention (UNCLOS) \n\u25ba Minamata-Konvention \u00fcber Quecksilber \n\u25ba Montrealer Protokoll \u00fcber Stoffe, die zu einem Abbau der Ozonschicht f\u00fchren  \n\u25ba Stockholmer Konvention \u00fcber persistente organische Schadstoffe \n\u25ba Pariser Abkommen zum Klimawandel \n\u25ba Abkommen zur Einrichtung des Gemeinsamen Fonds f\u00fcr Rohstoffe \n\u25ba Internationale Studiengruppen zu Blei und Zink, Nickel und Kupfer \n\u25ba Sechstes Internationales Zinnabkommen \n\u25ba Bilaterale Ressourcenabkommen zwischen der Bundesrepublik Deutschland und Kasachstan, der \nMongolei und Peru. \nDiese Vertr\u00e4ge unterscheiden sich erheblich in Gegenstand und Regelungstechnik. Insbesondere in \nBezug auf Ressourceneffizienz unterscheiden sie sich z.B. darin, welchen Teil der Wertsch\u00f6pfungskette \nsie betreffen, ob sie bestimmte Ressourcen betreffen und wie sie sich auf Ressourceneffizienz \nauswirken.  \nBeispielsweise regelt das Tiefseebodenregime im Rahmen des UNCLOS alle mineralischen Ressourcen \nin einem bestimmten geographischen Gebiet direkt am Anfang der Wertsch\u00f6pfungskette. Sein Ziel ist \nes, die Einnahmem\u00f6glichkeiten zu verteilen, und es gibt keine Anreize f\u00fcr eine effizientere Nutzung \nder Ressource nach dem Abbau. Es gibt auch kaum Anzeichen daf\u00fcr, dass das Regime darauf abzielt, \ndie gef\u00f6rderten Mengen zu begrenzen, um die Vorr\u00e4te auf Dauer zu erhalten. Das strenge und \ndetaillierte Management der F\u00f6rderung, einschlie\u00dflich der Umweltvorschriften, k\u00f6nnte jedoch einen \nAnreiz f\u00fcr eine effizientere Nutzung dieser Ressourcen bieten. \nDas Basler \u00dcbereinkommen und das Londoner Protokoll wirken sich auf alle Ressourcen aus, indem \nsie das Ende der Wertsch\u00f6pfungskette regulieren, d.h. indem sie wirtschaftliche Anreize sowie \nVerpflichtungen schaffen, weniger Abfall zu erzeugen und mehr zu recyceln. Die wichtigste \nRegelungstechnik ist in beiden F\u00e4llen das Verbot bestimmter (billiger) Entsorgungswege, kombiniert \nmit allgemeinen Verpflichtungen und einem verfahrenstechnischen Ansatz im Basler \u00dcbereinkommen. \nDie Frage, ob das Basler \u00dcbereinkommen die Wiederaufarbeitung behindert, wird zeigen, ob es in der \nLage ist, auf ver\u00e4nderte Umst\u00e4nde zu reagieren. \nDas Minamata \u00dcbereinkommen \u00fcber Quecksilber regelt unmittelbar eine spezifische Ressource - \nQuecksilber - entlang der gesamten Wertsch\u00f6pfungskette. Sein Ziel ist es nicht, Quecksilber effizienter \nzu nutzen, sondern die Produktion und Verwendung von Quecksilber ganz einzustellen. Es bietet FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n33 jedoch ein Instrumentarium verschiedener Regelungstechniken f\u00fcr die Verwendung von weniger \nQuecksilber w\u00e4hrend der Ausstiegsphase und f\u00fcr das Verbot. \nDie drei bilateralen Ressourcenabkommen Deutschlands befassen sich ausdr\u00fccklich mit der \nRessourceneffizienz, auch wenn es nur wenige und abstrakte Verpflichtungen gibt. Es ist das \nHerkunftsland, das die Ressourceneffizienz verbessern soll, nicht das Land, das den Zugang zu mehr \nRessourcen anstrebt. Der klare normative Schwerpunkt der Abkommen liegt auf der Erleichterung des \nZugangs zu Ressourcen, w\u00e4hrend die Ressourceneffizienz im Vergleich dazu ein minimales Gewicht \nhat.  \nDas Montrealer Protokoll und die Stockholmer Konvention regeln spezifische Substanzen, die keine \nabiotischen Ressourcen sind. Sie bieten nur dann einen Anreiz zur Ressourceneffizienz, wenn die \nSubstitution des regulierten Stoffes nicht die gleiche Menge an Ressourcen verbraucht. Die \nRegelungstechniken sind interessant, weil sie \u00e4hnlich wie das Basler \u00dcbereinkommen \nHandelsbeschr\u00e4nkungen enthalten, die auch Nichtvertragsstaaten betreffen. Sie sind au\u00dferdem darauf \nausgelegt, flexibel und vergleichsweise schnell auf neue Herausforderungen zu reagieren. \nDas Pariser Abkommen regelt Aktivit\u00e4ten im Zusammenhang mit dem Klimawandel, insbesondere mit \nTreibhausgasemissionen und in gewissem Umfang auch mit Senken, mit dem Ziel einer kollektiven \nglobalen Temperaturbegrenzung. Es regelt keine spezifischen Aktivit\u00e4ten, Substanzen oder \nRessourcen, aber es betrifft potenziell alle Ressourcen, die zum Klimawandel beitragen. Nach dem \nderzeitigen wissenschaftlichen Stand k\u00f6nnen die Ziele des Pariser Abkommens nur erreicht werden, \nwenn die Nutzung fossiler Brennstoffe mittelfristig drastisch reduziert und bis etwa 2050 schrittweise \neingestellt oder vollst\u00e4ndig ausgeglichen wird. Das Pariser Abkommen enth\u00e4lt jedoch vor allem \nVerfahrenspflichten, die den Parteien einen gro\u00dfen Ermessensspielraum lassen, welche individuellen \nMa\u00dfnahmen sie zur Erreichung der kollektiven Ziele ergreifen wollen. Die potenziellen \nSubstitutionseffekte des \u00dcbergangs zu einer kohlenstoffarmen Wirtschaft sind zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt \nnur schwer absch\u00e4tzbar.  \nDie Internationalen Metallstudiengruppen befassen sich speziell mit vier abiotischen Ressourcen \nweltweit: Blei, Zink, Nickel und Kupfer. Ihr Regelungsansatz besteht darin, Entscheidungstr\u00e4ger durch \ndie Bereitstellung von Informationen \u00fcber Angebot und Nachfrage und andere Marktentwicklungen zu \nbeeinflussen. Sie erw\u00e4hnen Ressourceneffizienz, aber es ist nicht klar, inwieweit dies die \nRessourceneffizienz tats\u00e4chlich f\u00f6rdert oder erm\u00f6glicht. \nDas Mandat des Common Fund for Commodities umfasst alle abiotischen Ressourcen, die als \nhandelbare Rohstoffe gelten. Seine Regelungstechnik besteht heute haupts\u00e4chlich in der Finanzierung \nvon Projekten zur Entwicklung von Rohstoffen. Dazu geh\u00f6ren auch Projekte, die Ressourceneffizienz \nf\u00f6rdern. Der CFC nimmt derzeit anscheinend Abstand von abiotischen Ressourcen. \nDas Internationale Zinnabkommen kann noch eine Lehre sein, auch wenn es nach der Insolvenz des \nInternationalen Zinnrates beendet wurde. Es befasste sich ausschlie\u00dflich mit Zinn und hatte einen \nhohen Einfluss auf die Ressourceneffizienz, da sein Mandat darin bestand, die Preisstabilit\u00e4t durch \nMarktinterventionen wie den Kauf und Verkauf von Zinn auf dem Markt und obligatorische Unter- und \nH\u00f6chstpreise zu gew\u00e4hrleisten. Der Internationale Zinnrat bediente sich auch finanzieller \nInstrumente, insbesondere der Kreditaufnahme, um seine Aktivit\u00e4ten zu finanzieren. Eine Lehre ist, \ndass solche Instrumente, wenn sie \u00fcberhaupt zum Einsatz kommen sollen, eindeutig mandatiert und \nkontrolliert werden sollten, um die finanziellen Risiken zu vermeiden, die schlie\u00dflich zum Scheitern \ndes Zinnabkommens f\u00fchrten. \nKeiner der bewerteten Vertr\u00e4ge geht explizit auf Ressourceneffizienz ein, mit Ausnahme der \nbilateralen Ressourcenvertr\u00e4ge Deutschlands mit Kasachstan, der Mongolei und Peru. Interessant ist, \ndass diese Abkommen darauf abzielen, die Ressourceneffizienz im Herkunftsland zu verbessern, \nanstatt Deutschland als das Land anzusprechen, das seinen Zugang zu Ressourcen verbessern m\u00f6chte. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n34 Die wenigen anderen F\u00e4lle, in denen Effizienz erw\u00e4hnt wird, beziehen sich z.B. auf die effiziente \nGewinnung, nicht aber auf Effizienz im Sinne eines sparsamen Umgangs mit der Ressource.  \nDavon abgesehen haben die Vertr\u00e4ge Auswirkungen auf verschiedene Aspekte der \nRessourceneffizienz: Eine Frage ist, ob Ressourceneffizienz darauf abzielt, die Ressource so lange wie \nm\u00f6glich zu nutzen - anstatt gar nicht. Aus dieser Perspektive w\u00e4re ein Verbot der Ressourcennutzung \nzwar ressourcenschonend, aber nicht ressourceneffizient im engeren Sinne, da die Ressource \nm\u00f6glicherweise \u00fcberhaupt nicht genutzt wird. Das Auslaufen und Verbot von Quecksilber im Rahmen \ndes Minamata-\u00dcbereinkommens ist ein Beispiel daf\u00fcr, ebenso wie der (nicht explizite, aber \nnotwendige) Ausstieg aus fossilen Brennstoffen im Rahmen des Pariser Abkommens. Ein m\u00f6gliches \nnormatives oder faktisches Verbot kann einen starken Anreiz bieten, die Ressourcen bis zum \nInkrafttreten des Verbots effizienter zu nutzen, aber dieser Effekt ist nicht zwingend. \nEin anderer Aspekt ist die Frage, ob das Ziel darin besteht, Effizienz f\u00fcr eine bestimmte Ressource \noder f\u00fcr eine bestimmte T\u00e4tigkeit zu verbessern, d.h. ihren gesamten Ressourcen-Fu\u00dfabdruck zu \nverringern. Auch hier ist das Minamata-\u00dcbereinkommen ein Beispiel f\u00fcr die Behandlung einer \nbestimmten Ressource. Im Gegensatz dazu zielt die Tiefseebodenregelung darauf ab, einen \nverschwenderischen Abbau f\u00fcr (mineralischen) Ressourcen zu vermeiden, und das Basler \n\u00dcbereinkommen enth\u00e4lt eine nicht n\u00e4her spezifizierte allgemeine Verpflichtung zur Minimierung \njeglicher Art von Abfall. \nVielleicht mit Ausnahme der direkten Marktintervention im Zinnabkommensmodell gibt es keinen \nbestimmten Regelungsansatz, der f\u00fcr Ressourceneffizienz als irrelevant erscheint oder von vornherein \nau\u00dfer Acht gelassen werden sollte. Die bestehenden Ans\u00e4tze betreffen je nachdem sowohl den Anfang \nals auch das Ende der Wertsch\u00f6pfungskette, eine bestimmte Ressource oder alle Ressourcen in einem \nGebiet, einige verwenden spezifische Ma\u00dfnahmen wie Handelsbeschr\u00e4nkungen oder Lizenzsysteme, \nw\u00e4hrend andere ein Ziel vorgeben und einem verfahrenstechnischen Ansatz folgen. Einige der \nVertr\u00e4ge wie das Minamata-\u00dcbereinkommen und das Pariser Abkommen sind relativ neu, und ihre \nAuswirkungen bleiben abzuwarten. Die Vielfalt der Ans\u00e4tze bedeutet, dass politische Optionen zur \nSt\u00e4rkung der Ressourceneffizienz nicht abstrakt, sondern im Zusammenhang des jeweiligen \nAbkommens zu bewerten sind.  \nObwohl die Vertragsverpflichtungen potenziell mehr Auswirkungen auf die Ressourceneffizienz \nhaben, zeigen sie im Gro\u00dfen und Ganzen ein Bild, das dem Gewohnheitsrecht und den sich noch \nherausbildenden Grunds\u00e4tzen \u00e4hnelt: Das Umweltv\u00f6lkerrecht befasst sich haupts\u00e4chlich mit \nT\u00e4tigkeiten mit direkten physischen Auswirkungen auf die Umwelt. Vielleicht mit Ausnahme von \nAbfall ber\u00fchrt es kaum Umweltfolgen, die durch ineffiziente Ressourcennutzung verursacht werden. \nWo dies doch der Fall ist, sind die bestehenden Regeln haupts\u00e4chlich darauf ausgerichtet, die \nVerf\u00fcgbarkeit von Ressourcen sicherzustellen oder Einnahmen zu erzielen. \nInternationale politische Prozesse und rechtlich unverbindliche Mechanismen \nIn den letzten Jahren sind eine Reihe internationaler politischer Prozesse und rechtlich nicht \nbindender Mechanismen (\"Instrumente\") zur F\u00f6rderung von Ressourceneffizienz entstanden. Das \nAgenda-Setting f\u00fcr RE ist deutlich vorangekommen.  \nDie Steuerungsmechanismen dieser Instrumente sind meist hochrangige politische Erkl\u00e4rungen mit \nstrategischen Priorit\u00e4ten und Leitlinien - d.h. unverbindliche Empfehlungen und gemeinsame \nHandlungsrahmen. In einigen F\u00e4llen werden diese mit einer kleinen Komponente zum Aufbau von \nKapazit\u00e4ten oder \"Umsetzungsmitteln\" f\u00fcr Entwicklungsl\u00e4nder kombiniert. Verschiedene Instrumente \nenthalten auch Elemente der Wissensverbreitung durch den Austausch bew\u00e4hrter Praktiken zwischen \nL\u00e4ndern, Lernforen oder Pilotprojekte. Das Internationale Ressourcen-Panel bietet eine Grundlage f\u00fcr \nneue wissenschaftlicher Erkenntnisse, z.B. Bewertungen von Politikoptionen im Hinblick auf ihre \nAuswirkungen auf die Ressourceneffizienz, und deren Einbringung in die politische Diskussion. Es ist \nein wertvoller Mechanismus, um ein gemeinsames Verst\u00e4ndnis von Fragen zu RE, ihren FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n35 Hintergr\u00fcnden und m\u00f6glichen L\u00f6sungen zu f\u00f6rdern. Ein relativ neuer Governance-Mechanismus ist \n\"Governance durch Ziele\", wie es von den SDGs verk\u00f6rpert wird. Dieser Ansatz l\u00e4sst den L\u00e4ndern \nSpielraum, die Erreichung (quantifizierter) Ziele zu operationalisieren und die Zielerreichung zu \n\u00fcberwachen, wobei dies in der Regel nicht mit Sanktionen kombiniert wird, wenn Ziele verfehlt \nwerden. Ein interessanter Governance-Mechanismus sind die Nachhaltigkeitsstandards der Weltbank \nund der IFC f\u00fcr staatliche Kreditnehmer und Kunden aus dem Privatsektor. Diese Standards sind in \ndem Ma\u00dfe verbindlich, wie sie Teil der Kredit- und Unterst\u00fctzungsbedingungen werden, auch wenn \nder Aufbau von Kapazit\u00e4ten (aller Parteien), die \u00dcberwachung und die Durchsetzung nach wie vor \nHerausforderungen darstellen. \nIn den meisten F\u00e4llen richten sich die Instrumente an alle UN-Mitgliedsstaaten, wobei der \nSchwerpunkt implizit auf Entwicklungs- und Schwellenl\u00e4ndern liegt, da die OECD-L\u00e4nder etwas weiter \nin Richtung einer Politik der Ressourceneffizienz vorangeschritten sind. Eine Ausnahme bilden die \nSGDs, da sie sich explizit auch an Industriel\u00e4nder richten, um deren Anstrengungen zu beschleunigen. \nAuch die OECD, die G7/8 und die G20 haben sich verpflichtet, die Ressourceneffizienz weiter zu \nf\u00f6rdern. \nDie meisten der Instrumente beziehen sich auf die gesamte Wertsch\u00f6pfungskette, d.h. sie spezifizieren \nkeine bestimmten Segmente der Wertsch\u00f6pfungskette (oder bestimmte Sektoren), in denen \nRessourceneffizienz verbessert werden soll. Einige wenige Instrumente konzentrieren sich allerdings \nauf die Gewinnung, andere auf Abfall und die 3R. Die intermedi\u00e4ren Segmente der \nWertsch\u00f6pfungskette werden selten explizit angesprochen.  \nEs lassen sich mindestens drei verschiedene Wirkungspfade unterscheiden: Einige Instrumente \nfinanzieren direkt Projekte zur Steigerung der Ressourceneffizienz; andere finanzieren \nressourcenverbrauchende Projekte, verlangen dabei jedoch eine gewisse Ber\u00fccksichtigung von \nRessourceneffizienz; die meisten Instrumente beeinflussen die Ressourceneffizienz indirekter durch \ndie Definition von Ressourceneffizienzzielen (SDGs, 10YFP, UNEP GEI, OECD Green Growth Strategy \nusw.) oder durch die Anregung (und teilweise Finanzierung der Entwicklung) spezifischer Strategien \nzur Steigerung der Ressourceneffizienz (Kobe 3R-Aktionsplan). \nDie Bewertung der Wirksamkeit der Instrumente ist schwierig, wenn es darum geht, nachzuweisen, \ndass sie die Regierungen dazu veranlasst haben, ihre Politik neu auszurichten, anzupassen oder zu \n\u00e4ndern. Es gibt nur wenige eingehende Evaluierungen und \u00dcberpr\u00fcfungen der (teilweise noch neuen) \nInstrumente, mit Ausnahme u.a. der UNEP Green Economy Initiative und des 3R-Aktionsplans der G8 \nvon Kobe. Aufgrund offensichtlicher methodischer Schwierigkeiten l\u00e4sst sich in keiner der \nvorliegenden Evaluationen nachweisen, dass internationale Initiativen den Ressourcenverbrauch auf \nL\u00e4nderebene ver\u00e4ndern. Auch die vorliegende Studie kann diese Analyse nicht leisten. Auf einer \nallgemeineren Ebene hat es allerdings den Anschein, dass es zwar eine Vielzahl von Politiken, Foren \nund Plattformen gibt, einige von ihnen jedoch nur eine kurze Lebensdauer und wenig \nFolgema\u00dfnahmen haben. Die Kreditkonditionalit\u00e4ten der Weltbankgruppe sind relativ starke \nInstrumente, da sie f\u00fcr Kreditnehmer und Kunden verbindlich sind. Sie betreffen jedoch nur \nEntwicklungsl\u00e4nder und entsprechende Akteure, was auch die Frage der Doppelmoral aufwirft. Auch \nist unklar, inwieweit sich gerade die f\u00fcr Ressourceneffizienz relevanten Konditionalit\u00e4ten tats\u00e4chlich \nauf die Projektkonzeption und -durchf\u00fchrung auswirken. Bei der Verwendung von \nWirkungsindikatoren wie der Spezifit\u00e4t der Instrumente in Bezug auf ihr Engagement, ihr politisches \nGewicht und ihre institutionelle Ausgestaltung und Substrukturen sind die meisten Instrumente \nrelativ unspezifisch, haben nur eine m\u00e4\u00dfige politische Schlagkraft, verf\u00fcgen oft \u00fcber unbedeutende \ninternationale Budgets und keine systematischen \u00dcberpr\u00fcfungsmechanismen. Dies gilt f\u00fcr jene \nInstrumente, die Teil von UN-Programmen sind und f\u00fcr Strategiedokumente multilateraler \nGruppierungen (OECD, G20, G8/7). UN-Initiativen, die von der Generalversammlung angenommen \noder gebilligt wurden, haben tendenziell eine breitere Legitimationsbasis, aber ihre \n\u00dcberpr\u00fcfungsmechanismen sind unterschiedlich streng. Die SDGs scheinen gegenw\u00e4rtig das FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n36 Instrument mit den besten Voraussetzungen zu sein, um Ver\u00e4nderungen in der politischen Praxis \nherbeizuf\u00fchren. \nDie vorliegenden Analysen sind jedoch ern\u00fcchternd: Trotz politischer Bem\u00fchungen und \nwirtschaftlicher Innovationen der Vergangenheit, die Ressourceneffizienz f\u00f6rdern, \u00fcberwiegen \nRebound-Effekte und generisches Wirtschaftswachstum insgesamt die Effizienzgewinne. Dies deutet \ndarauf hin, dass ein neues Kapitel diskutiert werden sollte: das der absoluten Reduktionen des \nRessourcenverbrauchs (Ressourcensuffizienz). Hier hat der Agenda-Setting-Prozess auf \ninternationaler Ebene noch kaum begonnen. \nNichtstaatliche Ans\u00e4tze  \nDie Relevanz nichtstaatlicher Regierungsans\u00e4tze f\u00fcr Ressourceneffizienz ist sehr unterschiedlich. \nW\u00e4hrend einige nur indirekte Auswirkungen haben, wirken sich andere direkt auf die \nRessourcennutzung aus. Berichtsstandards wie die GRI oder die KPIs f\u00fcr Environmental, Social and \nGovernance k\u00f6nnten indirekte Auswirkungen haben, indem sie die Ressourcennutzung von \nUnternehmen transparent machen. Das Gleiche l\u00e4sst sich f\u00fcr Lice-cycle assessments auf Produktebene \nsagen. Andere Standards verwenden Ziele, um eine direkte Wirkung zu erzielen. So wird z.B. die \nAnforderung unter EMAS, spezifische Ziele f\u00fcr den Ressourcenverbrauch festzulegen, Unternehmen \ndabei unterst\u00fctzen, den Ressourcenverbrauch bei der Anwendung des Managementsystems zu \nreduzieren. Eine weitere Initiative, die spezifische Ziele hinsichtlich der Ressourceneffizienz vorsieht, \nist die Zero Waste International Alliance. Sowohl Umweltzeichen vom Typ I als auch die GRS haben \ndirekte Auswirkungen, indem sie bestimmte Aspekte der Ressourceneffizienz f\u00fcr bestimmte Produkte \nzertifizieren. \nWas den institutionellen Rahmen anbelangt, so basieren die meisten Initiativen auf einem Multi-\nStakeholder-Netzwerk und schlie\u00dfen Akteure aus der Wirtschaft, der Zivilgesellschaft oder anderen \nInstitutionen wie Normsetzungsagenturen ein. Der Grad des Einflusses der Gruppen ist jedoch sehr \nunterschiedlich, wobei die Unternehmen in vielen F\u00e4llen der einflussreichste Stakeholder sind. In \neinigen F\u00e4llen spielen auch staatliche Akteure eine relevante Rolle bei der Unterst\u00fctzung der \nGr\u00fcndung sowie der Verbreitung der jeweiligen Initiative. \nDie Adressaten der meisten analysierten Initiativen sind Unternehmen. Die Instrumente beziehen sich \nentweder auf ihre Prozesse und -management oder auf ihre Produkte und Dienstleistungen. Eine \nAusnahme bildet das ZWIA, da es sich auch an Kommunen und die Zivilgesellschaft richtet. \nAls Steuerungsmechanismus wenden alle Initiativen Informationsinstrumente an. Zus\u00e4tzlich werden \nvon einigen auch Instrumente des Capacity Building oder der Kooperation eingesetzt. Nahezu alle \nInitiativen haben \u00dcberpr\u00fcfungsprozesse f\u00fcr ihre Standards eingerichtet. Im Falle der GRI oder des \ndeutschen Umweltzeichens \"Blauer Engel\" handelt es sich dabei um stark formalisierte und \nstandardisierte Mechanismen mit klar definierten Zeitrahmen und spezifischen Institutionen, die mit \nder Durchf\u00fchrung der \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung beauftragt sind. In den meisten anderen F\u00e4llen sind die \n\u00dcberpr\u00fcfungsprozesse eher informell. \nDer Grad der Diffusion unterscheidet sich stark zwischen den Standards und Initiativen. Einigen \nInitiativen, wie der GRI, ist es gelungen, sich zu weltweit angewandten Standards zu entwickeln, die \neinen Ma\u00dfstab setzen, auch wenn sie freiwilligen Charakter haben. Andere, wie die GRS oder GeSI, sind \nin ihrer geografischen oder sektoralen Anwendung und damit in ihren Auswirkungen begrenzt. \n\u00dcbergreifende Bewertung  \nDie Bestandsaufnahme ergibt ein gemischtes Bild : Die j\u00fcngsten nicht rechtsverbindlichen Ans\u00e4tze \nzeigen, dass Ressourceneffizienz auf die internationale politische Agenda gesetzt wurde. Die SDGs und \ndie G20 sind unterschiedliche Prozesse, aber sowohl auf hoher Ebene als auch mit politischem Gewicht \nund Legitimit\u00e4t. Obwohl beide Prozesse in der Vergangenheit in einigen F\u00e4llen Probleme damit hatten, \ndie politische Dynamik aufrechtzuerhalten und konkrete Ergebnisse zu erzielen, befinden sie sich im FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n37 Hinblick auf die Ressourceneffizienz in einem relativ fr\u00fchen Stadium und k\u00f6nnten noch politisches \nPotenzial haben.  \nDennoch gibt es praktisch keine verbindlichen Standards f\u00fcr Ressourceneffizienz. Das V\u00f6lkerrecht und \ndie sich herausbildenden Prinzipien und Konzepte befassen sich in den meisten F\u00e4llen nicht direkt mit \nRessourceneffizienz in Bezug auf die pro Produktionseinheit eingesetzten Ressourcen. Es gibt einige \nallgemeine Hinweise auf Effizienz in bilateralen Ressourcenvertr\u00e4gen und im Meeresbodenregime, \naber bisher konzentrierten sich diese darauf, die Gewinnung zu erleichtern und die Ressourcen \nzuzuteilen. \nEin Grund daf\u00fcr k\u00f6nnte sein, dass es den Staaten bisher leichter fiel, sich auf Umweltverpflichtungen \nzu einigen, die traditionelle Umweltauswirkungen betreffen. Es gibt auch konzeptionelle \nSchwierigkeiten , bestehende Normen und Konzepte auf Umweltauswirkungen anzuwenden, die \ndurch Ineffizienz verursacht werden. Der Zusammenhang zwischen Ressourcenineffizienz und \nUmweltauswirkungen ist weniger direkt als bei \"normalen\" Umweltauswirkungen und schwierig zu \nbestimmen. Ein weiterer Aspekt k\u00f6nnte sein, dass Ressourceneffizienz Umweltbelange in die Prozess- \nund Produktnormen und die Wettbewerbsf\u00e4higkeit einflie\u00dfen l\u00e4sst - ein Thema, das im \ninternationalen Handelsrecht behandelt wird. Das WTO-System, auf das wir nicht speziell eingehen, \nhat Regeln f\u00fcr Prozess- und Produktstandards, die aber keine Ressourceneffizienz erfordern, sondern \nstattdessen festlegen, in welchem Umfang Staaten solche Standards setzen d\u00fcrfen. Die Staaten \nk\u00f6nnten zur\u00fcckhaltend sein, verbindliche Regeln in diesem Bereich in Betracht zu ziehen, um \nProbleme mit diesen Handelsregeln zu vermeiden. Ein weiteres Hindernis k\u00f6nnte darin bestehen, dass \nRessourceneffizienzstandards, sofern sie nicht recht abstrakt bleiben, technische Anforderungen mit \nsich bringen w\u00fcrden, die sehr spezifisch f\u00fcr einzelne Produktionsprozesse sind und daher schwierig \nzu verhandeln und auf dem neuesten Stand zu halten w\u00e4ren.  \nVerbindliches internationales Recht setzt nur indirekt gewisse Anreize zur Verbesserung der \nRessourceneffizienz. Die wichtigsten Ankn\u00fcpfungspunkte in verbindlichen Instrumenten sind Aspekte \ndes Ressourcenschutzes und Vertr\u00e4ge \u00fcber Abf\u00e4lle. Sowohl die Ressourcenerhaltung als auch die \nWiedergewinnung sind inh\u00e4rente Bestandteile der Kreislaufwirtschaft von Abf\u00e4llen. \nRegelungsans\u00e4tze, die direkte Marktinterventionen vorsahen, wie etwa das Zinnabkommen, wurden \naufgegeben. Indirekte Verkn\u00fcpfungen des V\u00f6lkergewohnheitsrechts zu Ressourceneffizienz und neu \nentstehende oder vorgeschlagene \u00fcbergreifende Grunds\u00e4tze sind schwer zu beurteilen, weil ihr \nrechtlicher Status, ihr normativer Inhalt oder beides oft unklar oder abstrakt ist.  \nIn politischen Prozessen und unverbindlichen Mechanismen  sind Empfehlungen der h\u00e4ufigste \nAnsatz, oft in Form von politischen Erkl\u00e4rungen auf hoher Ebene mit strategischen Priorit\u00e4ten und \nLeitlinien, die oft von gemeinsamen Aktionsrahmen begleitet werden. Dar\u00fcber hinaus gibt es mehrere \neinschl\u00e4gige Programme internationaler Organisationen, das International Resource Panel als \nSchnittstelle zwischen Wissenschaft und Politik, und Kreditvergabestandards der Weltbankgruppe, die \nRessourceneffizienz beinhalten. Viele der Instrumente sind relativ unspezifisch, haben nur einen \nm\u00e4\u00dfigen politischen Output sowie unbedeutende institutionelle Einbettung und internationale \nBudgets. Eine Ausnahme sind die SDGs, da sie Ressourceneffizienzziele und abstrakte Ziele in \nVerbindung mit einem politischen \u00dcberwachungsmechanismus festlegen. Zumindest derzeit haben sie \nauch politisches Gewicht und Dynamik. Der G20-Dialog k\u00f6nnte auch politisches Buy-in generieren.  \nNicht-staatliche Governance-Ans\u00e4tze  umfassen haupts\u00e4chlich die Berichterstattung und andere \nInformations- und Managementinstrumente in Bezug auf Produkte und Produktionsprozesse. Ihre \nLenkungswirkung beruht haupts\u00e4chlich auf informellen Marktanreizen. \nProduktzertifizierungssysteme k\u00f6nnen Kriterien beinhalten, die direkt mit der Ressourceneffizienz \nverbunden sind, wie Langlebigkeit oder Reparierbarkeit.  \nAus institutioneller Sicht haben einige Institutionen das Potenzial, Ressourceneffizienz direkt oder \nindirekt zu behandeln. Die regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Tagung der Konferenz der Vertragsparteien mehrerer FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n38 multilateraler Umweltabkommen k\u00f6nnte Ressourceneffizienz auf ihre Tagesordnung setzen. Die \nInternationale Meeresbodenbeh\u00f6rde sieht ein striktes Abbau-Management von mineralischen \nRessourcen im Tiefseeboden vor, das Anreize f\u00fcr eine effizientere Ressourcennutzung bieten kann. Die \nUmwelt- und Sozialstandards der Weltbank und die Leistungsstandards der IFC beinhalten \nRessourceneffizienz in allgemeiner Form, mit einer Reihe von Vorbehalten wie technische und \nfinanzielle Machbarkeit. Diese Standards stellen einen Sonderfall dar, da sie zwischen der \nfinanzierenden Institution und den Empf\u00e4ngern verbindlich gemacht werden. \nObwohl auf den ersten Blick internationale, nicht bindende und nichtstaatliche Ans\u00e4tze spezifischer \nsind als verbindliche, handelt es sich dabei meist um Berichterstattungs- und Managementinstrumente \nmit unterschiedlichem Grad an Spezifizit\u00e4t hinsichtlich der Ressourcennutzung. Selbst in diesem \nBereich befassen sich nur wenige nichtstaatliche Standards speziell mit Ressourceneffizienz im Sinne \neiner tats\u00e4chlichen Quantifizierung einer zul\u00e4ssigen Materialmenge pro Output. \nEs gibt keine klare Verbindung oder erkennbare bewusste Arbeitsteilung zwischen verbindlichen und \nnicht verbindlichen oder anderen Ans\u00e4tzen. Anscheinend haben bisher weder unverbindliche \npolitische Initiativen noch andere nichtstaatliche und nichtstaatliche Ans\u00e4tze zur Ressourceneffizienz \ndie Entwicklung verbindlicher Verpflichtungen vorangetrieben. Dies schlie\u00dft jedoch nicht von \nvornherein aus, bestehende unverbindliche Ans\u00e4tze zu nutzen, um entweder politischen Willen in \ndieser Hinsicht aufzubauen, Machbarkeit zu zeigen oder als Modell zu dienen. \n \nPolitikoptionen zur St\u00e4rkung der Ressourceneffizienz in internationaler Governance  \n \nV\u00f6lkerrecht \nAusgehend von der Bewertung des bestehenden V\u00f6lkerrechts schlagen wir mehrere Optionen vor, um \nRessourceneffizienz st\u00e4rker in rechtsverbindlichen Verpflichtungen auf internationaler Ebene zu \nverankern.  \n\u25ba Ein Abkommen zur Ressourceneffizienz ? Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt empfehlen wir nicht, einen \neigenst\u00e4ndigen v\u00f6lkerrechtlichen Vertrag zu RE anzustreben, auch wenn es sich lediglich um einen \nallgemeinen Rahmenvertrag handelt. Der politische Aufwand, der zum gegenw\u00e4rtigen Zeitpunkt \nerforderlich w\u00e4re, um Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr v\u00f6lkerrechtliche Verpflichtungen in Bezug auf RE zu \nschaffen, erscheint betr\u00e4chtlich. Obwohl Ressourceneffizienz ein weithin akzeptiertes Ziel ist, auch \nin den SGDs, ist es ein bedeutender Schritt von politischer Unterst\u00fctzung zu einem \nrechtsverbindlichen Instrument. \nMittel- bis langfristig: Eine M\u00f6glichkeit besteht darin, auf die Schaffung der politischen \nVoraussetzungen f\u00fcr die v\u00f6lkerrechtliche Verankerung von RE hinzuarbeiten. Die Diskussion im \nRahmen internationaler Foren wie der G7-Allianz f\u00fcr Ressourceneffizienz, des G20-Dialogs \u00fcber \nRessourceneffizienz, der OECD usw. k\u00f6nnte nach und nach dazu gebracht werden, den \ngegenseitigen Nutzen eines internationalen RE-Vertrags, z.B. in Form eines allgemeinen \nRahmenvertrags, zu pr\u00fcfen. Neben einem eigenst\u00e4ndigen Vertrag gibt es auch die Option eines \nneuen Instruments im Rahmen eines bestehenden Vertrags (z.B. ein \"Protokoll\").  \nM\u00f6glicherweise langfristig: Unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung, dass verbindliche Regeln kein Selbstzweck \nsind, k\u00f6nnte die Idee eines allgemeinen, nicht \u00fcberreglementierenden Vertrags bestehende \ninternationale politische Initiativen b\u00fcndeln. Ein verbindliches Abkommen bedeutet idealerweise \nein hohes Ma\u00df an langfristigem Engagement sowohl auf internationaler als auch auf nationaler \nEbene. Im Hinblick auf die politische Durchf\u00fchrbarkeit ist anzumerken, dass ein Abkommen \nunterschiedliche Fragen auch unterschiedlich behandeln kann, etwa mehr oder weniger \npr\u00e4skriptiv und pr\u00e4zise, und den Parteien einen gewissen Spielraum lassen kann, um politischen FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n39 R\u00fcckhalt und Umsetzung im Laufe der Zeit zu f\u00f6rdern. Da RE ein breites Spektrum an Ressourcen \nund unterschiedlichen Ans\u00e4tzen umfasst, k\u00f6nnte es sinnvoll sein, f\u00fcr den Anfang eine \nRahmenstruktur zu erw\u00e4gen, die sp\u00e4tere \u00c4nderungen f\u00fcr bestimmte Ressourcen oder Themen \nvorsieht, z.B. in Anh\u00e4ngen oder Protokollen. Selbst wenn die rechtlichen Verpflichtungen als solche \nzun\u00e4chst eher Rahmencharakter h\u00e4tten, k\u00f6nnte ein Abkommen RE als Sachgebiet verankern und \nein st\u00e4ndiges Forum schaffen, das sich schrittweise mit ihm befasst. Das Abkommen k\u00f6nnte \nMandate f\u00fcr die weitere Arbeit und st\u00e4ndige Institutionen wie die \u00fcbliche \nVertragsstaatenkonferenz (COP) festlegen, die regelm\u00e4\u00dfig Beschl\u00fcsse zur Anleitung der \nUmsetzung durch die Vertragsparteien fasst. Um langfristig vorbereitet zu sein, stellen wir in \nAnhang 2 als Denkansto\u00df einen Umriss von m\u00f6glichen Vertragsbestimmungen vor. \nEinfluss auf RE: Ein Vertrag w\u00fcrde sich an Staaten (und die EU) wenden, die ihre Verpflichtungen \nin ihrer jeweiligen nationalen Gerichtsbarkeit umsetzen m\u00fcssten. Je nach dem spezifischen Inhalt \ndes Vertrags w\u00fcrde er \u00fcbergreifend sein, mit allgemeinen Verpflichtungen, die im Laufe der Zeit in \nAnh\u00e4ngen f\u00fcr bestimmte Sektoren, Ressourcen usw. ausgearbeitet werden k\u00f6nnten. \n\u25ba Ein Abkommen zu Plastik als Testfall . Anstelle eines Vertrags \u00fcber Ressourceneffizienz k\u00f6nnte \nein neuer Vertrag \u00fcber ein enger gefasstes Thema wie Plastik als Testfall und Modell f\u00fcr eine \neventuelle Verankerung von RE dienen.  \nBeispielsweise k\u00f6nnte ein Vertrag \u00fcber Kunststoffabf\u00e4lle auf der politischen Aufmerksamkeit f\u00fcr \ndieses Thema aufbauen und L\u00fccken in der bestehenden internationalen Governance schlie\u00dfen. Er \nk\u00f6nnte es erm\u00f6glichen, eine breitere Perspektive als Abfall und das Basler \u00dcbereinkommen \neinzunehmen und den gesamten Lebenszyklus von Plastik und Themen wie erweiterte \nHerstellerverantwortung aufzugreifen, die f\u00fcr Ressourceneffizienz allgemein wichtig sind. Es \nk\u00f6nnte eine Gelegenheit sein, internationale Governance zu einem spezifischen Thema zu \nerproben, f\u00fcr das es bereits eine breite politische Unterst\u00fctzung gibt. Zum gegenw\u00e4rtigen \nZeitpunkt ist jedoch nicht klar, ob diese politische Aufmerksamkeit in die Bereitschaft \u00fcberf\u00fchrt \nwerden k\u00f6nnte, verbindliche Pflichten einzugehen. \n\u25ba Das Verursacherprinzip und das bestehende Gewohnheitsrecht im Sinne der \nRessourceneffizienz interpretieren . Langfristig k\u00f6nnte Deutschland darauf hinwirken, \nGewohnheitsrecht zu schaffen oder so zu interpretieren, dass es Aspekte der Ressourceneffizienz \nerfasst. Beispielsweise k\u00f6nnte Deutschland eine erweiterte rechtliche Auslegung des weitgehend \netablierten Verursacherprinzips entwickeln und unterst\u00fctzen, nach der ineffiziente \nRessourcennutzung als \"umweltverschmutzend\" qualifiziert w\u00fcrde und Akteure, die Ressourcen \nineffizient nutzen, als \"Verursacher\" betrachtet w\u00fcrden, welche die durch die Ineffizienz \nverursachten Kosten tragen sollten. Es k\u00f6nnte auch erwogen werden, ob die Logik hinter \nKonzepten wie \"safe operating space\" und \"planetarische Grenzen\" in die Weiterentwicklung \nanderer bestehender Rechtsprinzipien und -regeln auf internationaler Ebene einflie\u00dfen kann.  \nEinfluss auf RE: \u00dcbergreifende allgemeine Verpflichtung der Staaten. \n\u25ba Pariser Abkommen zum Klimawandel : Mittel- bis langfristig Ressourceneffizienz einbeziehen. \nDeutschland k\u00f6nnte unter dem Pariser Abkommen RE als Thema ansprechen und f\u00f6rdern. Die \nlaufenden Klimaverhandlungen bieten daf\u00fcr eine Reihe von Optionen, z.B. von einmaligen \nVeranstaltungen bis hin zu regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Tagesordnungspunkten, und von einer Plattform f\u00fcr den \nInformationsaustausch bis hin zur Verankerung normativer Texte in den Beschl\u00fcssen der COP. In \nBezug auf spezifische Fragen umfassen die Optionen unter anderem die Einbeziehung von RE in \nNDCs oder in Berichtsformaten. \nEinfluss auf RE: Potenziell alle mit dem Klimawandel zusammenh\u00e4ngenden Themen, abh\u00e4ngig von \nden Priorit\u00e4ten und M\u00f6glichkeiten, die Deutschland im Klimaregime verfolgt. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n40  \nPolitikprozesse, Organisationen und nichtverbindliche Mechanismen \nWir identifizieren die folgenden Optionen:  \n\u25ba G20-Dialog : Ressourceneffizienz auf der Tagesordnung behalten und zu Empfehlungen und \nMa\u00dfnahmen weiterentwickeln. Dies k\u00f6nnte mittlere politische Anstrengungen erfordern, und es \nk\u00f6nnte f\u00fcr einige Mitglieder schwierig sein, diese Entwicklung mitzutragen.  \nKurzfristig, mittelfristig: G20-Dialog \u00fcber RE aktiv weiter verfolgen und sicherstellen, dass er \nfortgesetzt wird und dass RE auf der G20-Agenda bleibt.  \nKurzfristig, mittelfristig: Pr\u00fcfen, inwieweit die bestehende Arbeit im Rahmen der G7-Allianz f\u00fcr \nRessourceneffizienz in die G20 einflie\u00dfen und mit ihr koordiniert werden kann.  \nMittelfristig: Den G20-Dialog \u00fcber RE auf konkretere Arbeiten und Ergebnisse ausrichten, z.B. \ndurch die Festlegung von Zielen, Definitionen oder Ma\u00dfnahmen. \nEinfluss auf RE: Festlegung politischer Ziele, St\u00e4rkung der Forschung und Verbesserung des \nWissensstands, F\u00f6rderung der Ressourceneffizienz in Produktion und Konsum.  \n\u25ba G7: Fortsetzung der G7-Allianz f\u00fcr Ressourceneffizienz und Abstimmung mit dem G20-Dialog. \nMittelfristig: Deutschland sollte die Fortschritte bei der Bologna-Roadmap im Rahmen der G7 \n\u00fcberpr\u00fcfen und sie auf konkretere Pl\u00e4ne und Ma\u00dfnahmen in Bezug auf RE ausrichten. \nMittelfristig: Deutschland sollte M\u00f6glichkeiten zur Koordinierung des G20-Dialogs mit der G7-\nAllianz f\u00fcr Ressourceneffizienz verfolgen. \nEinfluss auf RE: Definition politischer Ziele, St\u00e4rkung der Forschung und Verbesserung des \nWissensstands, F\u00f6rderung der Ressourceneffizienz in Produktion und Konsum, Verbesserung der \nPolitikkoh\u00e4renz. \n\u25ba Follow-up IRP : Definition und Einbringen eines Mandats f\u00fcr die weitere Arbeit. \nKurz- und mittelfristig: Deutschland sollte die Legitimit\u00e4t der IRP als wissenschaftliches \nUnterst\u00fctzungsgremium unterst\u00fctzen und erh\u00f6hen.

FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n44 1 Introduction \n1.1 Background \nResource protection and resource efficiency are an ecological, economic and social necessity. Many \nresources are limited and under pressure from the rising world population, production methods, \nconsumer behaviour and the high per capita resource consumption. Using more and more resources \nwill exceed the limits of the earth\u2019s ecological carrying capacity in the foreseeable future. This \ndevelopment requires appropriate and effective measures. At the same time, a consistent resource \nefficiency policy and reduction of resource consumption can reduce the socio-economic and ecological \nimpacts of the extraction and utilization of raw materials, as well as the generation of waste. Resource \nefficiency is now on the international agenda, for example at the Rio + 20 Conference 2012 and the G8 \nand G7 group of states. Moreover, the G20 group of states decided at their meeting in Hamburg \n(Germany) in July 2017 to launch a G20 Resource Efficiency Dialogue in order to \u201cexchange good \npractices and national experiences to improve the efficiency and sustainability of natural resource use \nacross the entire life cycle, and to promote sustainable consumption and production patterns\u201d.3 The \n2015 sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations also aim at progressively improving, \nthrough 2030, global resource efficiency and at decoupling economic growth from environmental \ndegradation and resource consumption. However, at present there are no salient international treaties \nor institutions that channel and focus the political debate, particularly with regard to abiotic raw \nmaterials. In its current `Resource Efficiency Programme III\u00b4, the German Federal Government \ncommits to the goal of anchoring resource efficiency more strongly in international treaties, processes \nand institutions, and to examine options for action. In the long term, the Federal Government intends \nto pave the way for an international treaty on protecting abiotic natural resources and increasing \nresource efficiency.4 \n1.2 Objectives  \nThe research project\u2019s objective is to provide a legal and political science perspective to the Federal \nGovernment\u2019s stated intention to anchor the protection of resources more strongly at the international \nlevel. It analyses how public international law and other international governance mechanisms could \nbe used more effectively to increase resource efficiency and reduce resource consumption along the \nvalue chain.  \nThe study looks at abiotic raw materials (metals respectively ores, other mineral raw materials, fossil \nraw materials) and their utilisation, processing or other use. The study aims at elaborating policy \noptions and recommendations to the Federal Government on how international resource efficiency \ngovernance and international law could be shaped towards increased resource efficiency and less \nresource consumption. \nResource efficiency may be defined as the relation of a certain use/result to the deployment of the \nnatural resources necessary to achieve this use/result.5 Ultimately, it can be an important step \ntowards the wider objective of consuming less resources. The study therefore addresses resource \nefficiency as one strategy for the relative or absolute reduction of resource consumption.6 \n \n3 G20 Leader\u00b4s Declaration, Shaping an interconnected world, Hamburg, 7/8 July 2017, at 12 and annex thereto, available at \nhttps://www.g20.org/gipfeldokumente/G20-leaders-declaration.pdf.

This comprises in particular \nmetals, sand, gravel, potassium salts, quartz sand, and fossil raw materials.7 \n1.3 Approach and Methodology \n1.3.1 General approach and methodology \nThe study has three main parts: \n\u25ba Stocktake and assessment of existing international law and of non-legal and certain non-\ngovernmental instruments and processes related to resource efficiency of abiotic raw materials \n\u25ba Assessment of governance proposals in academic literature \n\u25ba Specific policy options and recommendations. \nFor the stocktake and assessment of existing international treaty law, we apply the following approach \nand set of assessment criteria to each instrument: \n\u25ba Summary \n\u25ba Results of the analysis in a nutshell, with a focus on the relevance of the treaty for resource \nefficiency \n\u25ba Overview \n\u25ba Form and legal status \n\u25ba Objectives \n\u25ba Territorial scope \n\u25ba Resources covered \n\u25ba Are abiotic resources covered? \n\u25ba Steps of the value chain covered \n\u25ba Type of steering mechanisms \n\u25ba Regulatory, planning, information tools etc. \n\u25ba Content \n\u25ba Relevant obligations for parties \n\u25ba Description and analysis of the main obligations of the treaty in general \n\u25ba Do these obligations address or otherwise have effects on resource efficiency? \n\u25ba Institutions, review and decision-making \n\u25ba Institutions \n\u25ba Evaluation and review \n\u25ba Reporting \n\u25ba Compliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures \n\u25ba Stakeholder and public involvement \n\u25ba Assessment \n\u25ba Coherence with other international treaties and policies \n\u25ba Relationship to other treaties addressing similar issues etc. \n\u25ba Political weight of the instruments \n\u25ba Number of parties, absence of major players etc. \n\u25ba Effectiveness \n\u25ba How does the treaty work in practice? Is it enforced? \n\u25ba How effective are the provisions relevant for resource efficiency? \n\u25ba Political opportunities and good practice examples \n\u25ba Are there political windows of opportunity to address resource efficiency (e.g. in \ncurrent COP discussions)? \n \n7 See UBA (2012), Glossar zum Ressourcenschutz, at 27. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n46 \u25ba Are there elements in the treaty which can be considered \u201cgood practice\u201d in the sense \nthat they might be relevant for the development of policy options and \nrecommendations (mainly because of their effects on resource efficiency, but also if \nthere are particularly innovative in general) \nFor ease of reference, references to \u201cstates\u201d in this study also include the EU unless otherwise stated.8 \nIn addition to the summary, a table at the beginning of each treaty gives an overview over the main \nresults: \nTable #: ### Convention (in force since ###) \nKey aspects  Summary  \nForm and legal status  \nObjectives  \n Parties  \nTerritorial scope  \nResources covered  \nStage of the value chain   \nSteering mechanism  \nPolitical weight  \nRelevance for RE  \nSource: Ecologic Institute \nThe criteria covered by the table correspond to the criteria in the text, except for the parties which are \nmentioned separately from the form and legal status, and the criterion relevance for resource \nefficiency (RE), which highlights the issue of whether the treaty in question is relevant for resource \nefficiency or resource conservation. In addition to text description, both aspects of the criterion \n\u201crelevance\u201d are assessed by the following qualitative scale: \n+++ high \n++ medium \n+ low \n0 no relevance \nIt has to be noted that \u201crelevance for RE\u201d does not only address whether a particular treaty furthers \nresource efficiency or resource conservation in some way. It also covers whether a particular treaty \nimpedes resource efficiency or resource conservation. \nThis approach and set of criteria is also used for the stocktaking and assessment of non-legal and \ncertain non-governmental instruments and processes related to resource efficiency of abiotic raw \nmaterials, albeit with modifications where necessary. \n \n8 Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, cf. Articles 1, 3(2) and 47 Treaty of European Union (TEU), 216  \nTreaty on the Functioning of the Union (TFEU). According to Article 1 TEU, the EU replaced and succeeded the European \nCommunity (EC), which had entered into treaties prior to the Treaty of Lisbon. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n47 For the stocktaking and assessment of principles of international law we use a simplified approach \ncontaining the following criteria: \n\u25ba Development and content \n\u25ba Status \n\u25ba Applicability to abiotic resources and resource efficiency \n\u25ba Assessment \n\u25ba Summary \n1.3.2 Selection of instruments for the stocktake \nBased on the project\u2019s scope and available resources, the project pre-selected a number of treaties, \nprinciples, concepts and non-binding instruments for analysis. The treaties and principles of \ninternational law to be analysed were chosen based on a presumptive screening of their potential \nrelevance for resource efficiency or reduction of resource consumption. They also represent different \ngovernance approaches: For example, the UNCLOS\u00b4provisions on the deep seabed are considered to be \n\u201cthe most developed international governance regime or regulatory framework for mineral resources \nactivities\u201d.9The London Protocol addresses waste by prohibiting dumping at sea. Some instruments \ndirectly address relevant resources, e.g. the Common Fund for Commodities, the Tin Agreement, the \nInternational Study Groups and bilateral resource agreements. The Minamata Convention regulates \none particular resource, including a specific provision on artisanal and small-scale mining. Some \ntreaties address cross-cutting issues but have a potentially high indirect impact on resource \nefficiency/consumption reduction. This is notably the case for the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, \nsince its objective to keep the increase in global temperature well below 2\u00b0C will arguably require a \nlarge-scale reduction of fossil fuel consumption. Treaties such as the Stockholm Convention and the \nMontreal Protocol regulate substances and productions processes which could indirectly impact \nresource efficiency. The Montreal Protocol is interesting also because it created an influential model \nfor environmental treaties and directly addressed production processes. Some treaties were not \nselected because they were considered more relevant for a parallel research project for the Federal \nEnvironment Agency on the international governance of the extraction of raw materials.10 This is \nnotably the case for the WTO and bilateral investment agreements.  \nIn addition to binding instruments and obligations, a set of non-legal and non-governmental \ninstruments and processes aimed at enhancing the resource efficiency of abiotic raw materials were \nscreened and assessed against the following criteria: \n\u25ba Steering mechanism: The selection of instruments and processes should cover approaches \nusing different steering mechanisms. Among others, the selected approaches should \ninclude the setting of goals or standards (i.e., go beyond the international exchange of best \npractice or provision of learning fora); \n\u25ba Content: There should be an explicit focus on instruments addressing the efficiency of \n(abiotic) resources, ideally covering different segments of society and the economy  \u2013 e.g., \nresource efficiency in the public sector (procurement, construction etc.), in cities, in \ndifferent industries, in different segments of the value chain and related to different \n(abiotic) resources; \n\u25ba Implementation and potential impact: The selected instruments should ideally be \nimplemented sufficiently long to be able to find data on their effectiveness; they should \n \n9 Dalupan (2004), at 10. \n10 Bodle (2020) et al., International Governance for Environmentally Sound Supply of Raw Materials \u2013 Policy Options and \nRecommendations, UBA Text 31/2020.

We developed a standardised approach focussing on few overarching criteria: \nFor the existing proposals: \n\u25ba Description of the proposal \n\u25ba Assessment (including considerations such as the level of detail of the proposal, the \npotential effectiveness and political feasibility, the time frame, level of political effort and \ncosts needed for the realisation etc.)  \n\u25ba Levers for resource efficiency, based on the German Environment Ministry\u2019s Resource \nEfficiency Programme - ProgRess II.11 \nFor our own suggested options and recommendations: \n\u25ba Presentation of the recommendations in a box \n\u25ba Description of the recommendation (including considerations such as the added value and \npotential impacts of the recommendation, the time frame and level of political effort \nneeded for the realisation of the recommendation, its political feasibility etc.)  \n\u25ba Levers for resource efficiency according to ProgRess II. \n \n11 See the list of levers for resource efficiency in Section 4.1 Annex 1. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n49 2 Stocktake and analysis of barriers \nThis section takes stock of selected instruments of existing international law as well as of non-binding \nand certain non-governmental instruments and processes related to resource efficiency of abiotic raw \nmaterials. It provides the analytical basis for the recommendations in Section 3.2.  \nThe stocktake is based on a broad understanding of international governance which includes binding \nas well as non-binding steering mechanisms. This includes primarily the three traditional sources of \ninternational law according to article 38 of the the ICJ statute: treaties, customary law and general \nprinciples. of law. In addition, other elements of the international legal framework are not legally \nbinding but nonetheless influence or provide guidance to the conduct of states. We include non-\nbinding political steering mechanisms as well as global mechanisms that do not originate from state \nauthority but have been been picked up by public regulation or have similar steering effects. We \nanalyse and assess whether and how these mechanisms contribute to increasing resource efficiency \nand decreasing resource consumption at the international level, and where there could room and \npolitical opportunites for improvement. This includes the whole value chain, except environmental \nand social standards at the extraction stage, which are addressed in a parallel research project. \n \n2.1 The existing legal framework: Treaty law and customary law relevant to \nresource efficiency \nThe first part of the stocktake includes binding international law. Based on the traditional sources \nlisted in Article 38 of the Statue of the International Court of Justice, this includes treaties, customary \nlaw, and general principles of law.  \nThe analysis also includes aspects that are specific to international law. International law is created \ndifferently from national law and has different enforcement mechanisms. Rules are agreed between \npeers and treaties apply only to those States that are Party to them. In contrast, customary law usually \napplies to all states regardless of whether they are a Party to, and bound by, a particular treaty.12 In \naddition, there is a range of non-binding mechanisms that may in practice have stronger political force \nthan binding rules and sometimes be more strictly complied with. For instance, treaty regimes with \npermanent institutions frequently adopt decisions which are usually not binding in the strict legal \nsense but are in practice treated and complied with by the parties as the agreed rules for \nimplementating the treaty. Assessing this field of such therefore also includes political aspects and \npractical experience.  \n \n2.1.1 Customary law and general principles of law \n2.1.1.1 Relevance in general and use of terms \nIn addition to treaties, customary law is s source of international law binding upon states. It derives \nfrom \u201cevidence of a general practice accepted as law\" (Art. 38 ICJ Statute). In order to establish a norm \nof customary law, it has to be shown that there is sufficient state practice adhering to that rule, and \nthat states accept it as legally binding. The third main source of international law according to the ICJ \nstatute are \u201cgeneral principles of law recognised by civilized nations\u201d, which generally speaking means \nnorms that are so widely accepted in the world\u2019s national legal systems that they also bind states in \ninternational law. An assessment of these sources involves several problems that have to be taken into \naccount:  \n \n12 Except for so-called \u201cpersistent objectors\u201d. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n50 First, there is no single or authorative list of customary law - perhaps with the exception of ICJ \njudgments. Second, what constitutes sufficient state practice and how acceptance as law becomes \nmanifest is itself subject to debate. Third, it can take a long period of time, sometimes years or decades, \nfor a concept or proposed norm to evolve into customary law. Fourth, a norm may be enshrined in \ntreaties whilst at the same time evolve into or exist as customary law. In some cases, decisions by the \nICJ have ruled that certain norms are customary law. But in many cases the legal status of many \nproposed rules or concepts is not clear and subject to debate. States, stakeholders or academics may \nargue that a norm is already customary law, while others may argue that the existing state practice is \nnot sufficient or that there is no conclusive evidence that states, even if they adhere to it in practice, \naccept to be legally bound .  \nAnother important issue relates to terminology and the content of norms, in particular those of \ncustomary law. Some concepts and norms are labeled or invoked as \u201cprinciples\u201d, e.g. the \n\u201cprecautionary principle\u201d. First, this terminology is easy to confuse with, but different from, the \n\u201cgeneral principles of law recognised by civilized nations\u201d, i.e. the third main source of international \nlaw. Second, in legal theory, some describe the concept of \u201cprinciples\u201d as a category of norms which is \ndistinct from \u201crules\u201d. According to this abstract distinction, a \u201crule\u201d is either complied with or not, \nwhereas a \u201cprinciple\u201d can be complied with to different degrees.13 Others use three categories: \nconcepts , principles and rules, in orer to denote different degrees of abstraction.14 However, neither \nterminology nor international practice in this regard are uniform or agreed.15 International documents \nand statements do not usually make it clear whether they attach a distinct legal meaning to the term \n\u201cprinciple\u201d. Treaty provisions that are labeled as \u201cprinciples\u201d show that the term is relevant in practice \nbut provide no indication as to whether their legal nature is supposed to be different from other \nprovisions.16 The ICJ has used the term \u201c principle of prevention\u201d to describe \u201ca customary rule\u201d, and \nstates have referred to the prohibition of the use of force, which clearly qualifies as a binary \u201crule\u201d, as a \n\u201cprinciple\u201d.17 This shows that international legal practice does not necessarily follow the terminology \nor categorical distinction proposed in legal theory. In addition, there is no universal legal \nunderstanding of what a \u201cprinciple\u201d is across different legal orders.18 Third, the group of identifiable \ninternational environmental law principles is legally ambiguous and inconsistent.19 \nFor the purpose of this study, we use the terms \u201cprinciple\u201d and \u201cconcept\u201d for ease of reference and \nwithout prejudice to the legal status, content, or consequence of the concept in question. We \ndistinguish two aspects regardless of their denomination: (1) The concept\u2019s legal status: Is it \ncustomary law according to the established criteria set out above? This question applies regardless of \nwhether a concept is labeled a \u201cprinciple\u201d. The status of several concepts that are discussed in \ninternational environmental law is unclear or disputed. Some may already have the legal status of \nbinding customary law, others might be emerging customary rules or mere proposals. (2) What is the \nactual or proposed legal content and consequence of the concept? Is it clear what states are supposed \n \n13 Czarnecki (2008) at 116 fn. 490.

Customary rules and general concepts \nremain relevant to understanding the underpinnings and the limitations of the international law on \nnatural resources.21 But it is important to not read a desired legal status or meaning into a concept \nwhen there is insufficient state practice to support it.  \n \n2.1.1.2 Permanent sovereignty over natural resources \nDevelopment and Content \nThe principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources developed after 1945, mainly as \nresponse of newly independent developing states to the problem of foreign ownership of their mineral \nresources.22 It is expressed and elaborated in several resolutions of the UN General Assembly23, \nnotably resolution 180324, the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic \nOrder25 and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States26. According to the last resolution, \n\u201cEvery state has and shall freely exercise full permanent sovereignty including possession, use and \ndisposal, over all its natural resources\u201d (Art. 2). It determines that sovereignty over territory includes \nthe exclusive right to decide whether and how to access and exploit its natural resources. Other states, \ne.g. such with no resources of their own, have no right to access them. The principle of permanent \nsovereignty over natural resources is to be distinguished from other norms which may restrict this \nsovereignty, such as the principle of common heritage of mankind and the principle of common \nconcern of humankind.27 \nThe principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources has influenced international \nnegotiations28 and has been referred to in international environmental agreements and other \ninstruments, for example in the Preamble of the Basel Convention29 or in the Biodiversity \nConvention30, and in Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration31 and Principle 2 of the Rio \nDeclaration.32 However, the principle has been not only confirmed but also qualified by these treaties \nand other rules of customary international law concerning conservation of natural resources and \nenvironmental protection. Resolution 1803 already states that the right \u201cmust be exercised in the \ninterest of their national development and the well-being of the people of the state concerned\u201c. \n \n20 Cf.

Resource efficiency is not directly addressed, but \ncould become relevant indirectly (see below under assessment). \nAssessment \nThe principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources originated over the issue of \u201cwho\u201d has \nthe right to access natural resources. Its function is to preclude claims by other states, including those \nwithout the resource in question, for access to that resource. The sovereign right also includes the \nright not to exploit resources. With regard to \u201chow\u201d states may exploit, the principle includes use and \ndisposal. It could therefore prima facie  be a barrier to resource efficiency, as it does not seem to \nrequire efficiency or preclude a state from using its own resources inefficiently. This appears to be in \nline with the right of peoples to freely dispose of their natural resources for their own ends, as \nenshrined in the two main global human rights instruments.37  \nYet the principle is not absolute. Its exercise was qualified as early as in its first formulation. In \naddition, the right has to be exercised in accordance with other international obligations. For instance, \ninternational economic law can address ownership and export of that resource and therefore influence \ninternational supply, which is one of the incentives for efficiency. Other requirements could be posed \nby international environmental law. Although some aspects of it, for instance those related to \nsustainability, could direct states towards using resources more efficiently, but so far none has \nemerged as a clear requirement for efficiency. \nSummary \nThe principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources is the starting point for the rights and \nduties of states over natural resources within their own territory. It covers abiotic resources, but does \nnot directly address resource efficiency. Its wording appears to be a barrier to resource efficiency, \n \n33 See the analysis of particular instruments, infra; Birnie et al (2009) at 192; see also Sands (2003) at 237. \n34 Birnie et al (2009) at 192.

However, the court held that the principle did not apply to the specific situation in which an occupying \npower loots, plunders and exploits natural resources in the occupied territory, ibid. According to Armstrong (2015) at 131, \n\u201cthe normative justification for that doctrine is far from clear\u201d.

FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n53 because it can be read as including the right to use one\u2019s own resources inefficiently. It also means that \nother states have no right to access the resources in the first place, unless such access is granted e.g. by \ninternational economic law. However, a state\u00b4s sovereignty over its resources is not absolute and \nsubject to other obligations, which include established environmental norms and would also include \nobligations to use resources efficiently should such an obligation exist or emerge.  \n \n2.1.1.3 Equitable utilisation of shared natural resources \nThere are several concepts addressing international interest in the protection of areas that are not \nexclusively under the national jurisdiction of one state. For instance, the term \u201ccommon goods\u201d may be \nused as an overarching general term for such concepts. However, there is no single concept of common \ngoods that is commonly accepted as a separate legal term or concept.38 In practice, a variety of terms \nare used. In this and the subsequent sections, four concepts will be briefly described, namely the \nprinciples of \u201cequitable utilisation of shared resources\u201c, \u201ccommon areas\u201d, \u201ccommon heritage of \nmankind\u201d, and \u201ccommon concern of humankind\u201d. \nDevelopment and content \nThe principle of shared natural resources applies to resources which do neither fall within the \nexclusive control of one state nor belong to areas beyond national jurisdiction. This intermediate \ncategory stands for \u201ca limited form of community interest, usually involving a small group of states in \ngeographical contiguity, which exercise shared rights over the resources in question\u201d.39 International \nwatercourses are the oldest and by far the most important examples of shared natural resources.40 \nOther important examples include migratory species and mineral deposits (for the latter see below).41 \nBeyond its application to specific areas, there have been attempts to generalise the principle of \nequitable utilisation of shared natural resources. Based on earlier UN General Assembly resolutions on \nthe subject42, the Governing Council of UNEP adopted in 1978 \u201cDraft Principles of Conduct in the Field \nof the Environment for the Guidance of States in the Conservation and Harmonious Utilization of \nNatural Resources Shared by Two or More States\u201d.43 According to Principle 1 (Duty to Co-operate) \n\u201cit is necessary for States to cooperate in the field of the environment concerning the \nconservation and harmonious utilization of natural resources shared by two or more States. \nAccordingly, it is necessary that consistent with the concept of equitable utilization of shared \nnatural resources, States cooperate with a view to controlling, preventing, reducing or \neliminating adverse environmental effects which may result from the utilization of such \nresources. Such co-operation is to take place on an equal footing and taking into account the \nsovereignty, rights, and interests of the states concerned.\u201d \nThe subsequent principles are variations and developments of the principle of equitable utilisation of \nshared natural resources, albeit with a focus on environmental aspects.44 \n \n38 See Durner (2001), at 18 and at 17 footnote 2, for the variety of terms used in practice. \n39 Birnie et al (2009) at 192. \n40 Durner (2001) at 75. \n41 See Durner (2001) at 75 et seq.; Birnie et al (2009) at 192, with further examples. \n42 See UN Doc. A/RES/3129/XXVIII and especially Art. 3 of the \u201cCharter of Economic Rights and Duties of States\u201d, 12 \nDecember 1974, UN Doc. A/RES/3281/XXIX: \u201cIn the exploitation of natural resources shared by two or more countries, \neach state must cooperate on the basis of a system of information and prior consultations in order to achieve optimum use \nof such resources without causing damage to the legitimate interests of others.\u201d \n43 ILM 17 (1978), 1091. \n44 Durner (2001) at 114-115. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n54 According to Durner45, the principle of equitable utilisation of shared natural resources has also been \nincorporated in a general way into the 1994 Convention against Desertification.46 According to Art. 11 \nUNCCD, subregional action programmes \u201cshall establish [...] mechanisms for the management of \nshared natural resources\u201d, and priority areas for such programmes shall focus on \u201cjoint programmes \nfor the sustainable management of transboundary natural resources through bilateral and multilateral \nmechanisms\u201d. \nAs shown by these examples, the principle of equitable utilisation of shared natural resources aims at \nensuring a balance of interests between the parties concerned.47 As with other general norms and \nprinciples, the content that can be regarded as widely accepted is rather vague. First, it limits the \nprinciple of permanent sovereignty over natural resources because other states also have the right to \nequitably use the shared resource.48 Second, it is basically procedural, the most important component \nbeing the obligation to cooperate.49 More specific procedural duties can only be discerned for certain \nareas, notably for international watercourses50, but not be deduced generally.51 Together, the material \nright of all states that share the resource, and the procedural component arguably limit any one state\u2019s \nright to simply insist on its own position.52 In practice, the principle has often been made operative \nthrough bilateral treaties.53  \nStatus \nAs recognised by the International Court of Justice in the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project case54, \nequitable utilisation is recognised as the main customary law rule governing the use and allocation of \ninternational water resources.55 Beyond this area, however, it is unclear to what extent the principle \nreflects customary law. According to a large part of the literature, the UNEP principles represent \ncustomary international law.56 However, although they can be said to reflect in many ways \ncontemporary international law and the practice of a significant number of states, the principles have \nbeen controversial from the beginning and should not be considered as settled law supported by all \nstates.57 Thus, the principle of equitable utilisation of shared natural resources reflects customary law \nonly for some areas covered by state practice, notably international watercourses, but also liquid and \ngaseous minerals (see below).58 \n \n45 Durner (2001) at 112. \n46 Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly \nin Africa, 14 October 1994, entered into force on 26 December 1996 (UNCCD), United Nations Treaty Series, vol. 1954, at 3.  \n47 Birnie et al (2009) at 194; Durner (2001) at 120. \n48 See Durner (2001) at 117-118 with further references. \n49 Durner (2001) at 120. \n50 According to the arbitration award in the Lac Lanoux  arbitration, they include the duties of prior information, appropriate \nconsideration of the interests of the other side(s), and of negotiations in good faith, see Durner (2001) at 130-131 with \nfurther references.

While it may reflect customary law applicable to transboundary mineral deposits, \nit is exclusively concerned with the division of the resources or the profits resulting from exploitation \nbetween the parties concerned. An obligation to share the resources or their profits can therefore \nimpede (absolute) resource efficiency because it presumes that exploitation is in the interest of all \nstates concerned. On the other hand, having to share the resource or the profits may lead to increased \n(relative) efficiency on the part of each state.  \nSummary \nThe principle of equitable utilisation of shared natural resources applies to resources which do neither \nfall within the exclusive control of one state nor belong to areas beyond national jurisdiction. In \nlimiting the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources, it aims at ensuring a balance of \ninterests between the parties concerned. While the contours of the principles are still rather vague, it \nis settled that it is basically procedural, the most important component being the obligation to \ncooperate. Beyond its relevance for international watercourses, it is unclear to what extent the \n \n59 See Birnie et al (2009) 193 with references.

FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n56 principle reflects customary law. State practice on transboundary mineral deposits shows that the \nprinciple is exclusively concerned with the division of the resources or the profits resulting from \nexploitation between the parties concerned. This division may further resource efficiency in order to \nmximise the individual share, but the common interest in exploitation runs counter to the general \nconservation aspect over time. \n \n2.1.1.4 Common areas (common property, res communis) \nDevelopment and Content \nThe concepts of \u201ccommon areas\u201d,68 \u201ccommon property\u201d69 and \u201cres communis\u201d70 are used \nsynonymously. They refer to areas beyond national jurisdiction such as the high seas, outer space, and \npossibly Antarctica.71 The concept was first used in international law to determine the status of the \nhigh seas.72 Its two basic components are free access to a common resource and impossibility of \nappropriation.73 They are codified for example by Art. 87 and 89 of the UN Convention on the Law of \nthe Sea (UNCLOS)74, according to which \u201c[t]he high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-\nlocked.\u201d [...] \u201cNo state may validly purport any part of the high seas to its sovereignty.\u201d Comparable to \nthe principle of permanent sovereignty over national resources, free access to a common resource \nincludes a priori the right to abuse of the common areas, for example by using it for waste dumping or \nby excessive fishing, especially by dominant states.75 However, the free access component has been \nrestricted more and more by international law, especially treaty law. 76 In particular, it has to be \nexercised with reasonable regards to the interests of other states77, and correlates with duties to \nensure the protection of the environment78, as codified by UNCLOS, the Treaty on Outer Space or other \nagreements such as the London Protocol on waste dumping.79 The latter duty of environmental \nprotection, an extension of the no-harm principle to common areas, has also been expressed by Art. 21 \nof the Stockholm Declaration80 and, above all, recognised by the International Court of Justice as \nreflecting customary international law.81 Concerning its implementation, there is a tendency in theory \n \n68 Used by Dupuy and Vi \u00f1uales (2015) at 82. \n69 Used by Birnie et al (2009) at 194. \n70 Used by Shaw (2008) at 492 and mentioned by Dupuy and Vi \u00f1uales (2015) at 82. \n71 Birnie et al (2009) at 194-195; Dupuy and Vi \u00f1uales (2015) at 82-83.

As a starting \npoint, it excludes claims of sovereignty, which enable free exploitation of resources and thus rather \nimpedes resource efficiency. However, in those areas that are legally regarded as \u201ccommon\u201d, the \noriginal starting point has been restricted particularly by duties of environmental protection and \nresource conservation. In addition, obligations regarding sharing of resources may apply. However, \nthere is little evidence that such restrictions are intrinsic to the concept of common areas as such. For \ninstance, according to Art. 117 UNCLOS, \u201cStates have the duty to take \u2026 such measures for their \nrespective nationals as may be necessary for the conservation of the living resources of the high seas.\u201d \nIn the Icelandic Fisheries Cases the International Court of Justice found that the state concerned had \nobligations of equitable exploitation and conservation of the fishery resources, and a duty to negotiate \nin order to reach a solution taking account of those obligations.89 However, specific instruments on \nresource conservation are restricted to the living resources of the sea and linked to the well-known \nproblem of overfishing.90 Moreover, the concept of conservation, in addition of being general, \u201cremains \nclosely related to supplying human needs, albeit on a sustainable basis\u201d, which makes it difficult to \nimplement.91 \n \n82 Durner (2001) at 171 et seq. with further references. \n83 See e.g. Art. 88 and 141 UNCLOS and Durner (2001) at 176-178. \n84 See the references cited above and Durner (2001) at 179-180. \n85 Durner (2001) at 180. \n86 See Durner (2001) at 180; generally Birnie et al (2009) at 196-197. \n87 Birnie et al (2009) 195-196. \n88 However, according to the treaty regime established by Art. 7 of the 1991 Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on the Protection \nof the Environment, \u201cany activity relating to mineral resources, other than scientific research, shall be prohibited.\u201d \n89 Cf.

FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n58 Summary \nThe legal concept of common areas refers to areas beyond national jurisdiction such as the high seas, \nthe outer space, and possibly Antarctica. The legal concept of of common areas is recognised as \ncustomary law but it is difficult to determine the particular customary  legal rights and obligations \nbecause the status of the areas in question is also determined by treaties. Its two basic components are \nfree access to the common resources and that the area and its resources are not subject to \nappropriation by any state. This includes the abiotic resources of outer space and possibly also the \nmineral resources of Antarctica. However, the right to free access has to be exercised with reasonable \nregards to the interests of other states, and correlates with (separate) duties to ensure the protection \nof the environment. It does not explicitly or directly address resource efficiency. As a starting point, it \naims at exploiting resources and thus impedes the conservation aspect of resource efficiency over \ntime. Similar to the equitable utilisation of shared resources, the interest of other states could to some \nextent restrict inefficient use, for instance if one state were to use up a resource completely. More \nspecific duties and obligations in this regard are not intrinsic to this concept but could arise from other \nsources. However, existing specific instruments on resource conservation are restricted to living \nresources.  \n \n2.1.1.5 Common heritage of mankind \nThe concept of common heritage of mankind was introduced in the context of early discussions on the \nexploitation of the resources of the deep sea-bed beyond national jurisdiction.92 Art. 136 and 137 \nUNCLOS state that the seabed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national \njurisdiction, as well as its resources, to be \u201ccommon heritage of mankind\u201d, vested in mankind as a \nwhole, on whose behalf an International Sea-bed Authority shall act. The concept of common heritage \nof mankind builds on the status of common areas, notably the duty of protection of the area subject to \nthe common heritage regime93 and the prohibition of use for military purposes (exclusive use for \npeaceful purposes), but also the right of exploration.94 It also develops the concept of common areas \nfurther95 by placing the exploitation of the resources under common management and even an \ninternational authority.96 In addition, the joint management is intended for the benefit of all states and \npeoples97, including those who do not have the technical and financial means to exploit the \nresources.98 This benefit implies an equitable sharing of the rewards resulting from exploitation \nactivities99, but does not forbid mining activities by states.100 The joint benefit aspects are also \nincorporated in the 1979 Moon Treaty101, whose practical effect and legal weight is very limited \nbecause the states most active in the exploitation of outer space have not ratified it and the \n \n92 In 1967, Malta proposed the concept to the UN General Assembly as a basis for exploiting the resources of the deep sea-\nbed, see Birnie et al (2009) at 197; see also Macdonald (1995), Noyes (2012), all with references. \n93 See Art. 145 compared to Art. 192 UNCLOS. \n94 See Durner (2001) at 225-229, especially 228-229. \n95 Durner (2001) at 139-140, 228-229. \n96 Birnie et al (2009) at 198 with reference to the competence of the International Seabed Authority according to Art. 145 \nUNCLOS. \n97 See Art. 140 UNCLOS: \u201cActivities in the Area shall [\u2026] be carries out for the benefit of mankind as a whole [\u2026], and taking \ninto particular consideration the interests and needs of developing States and peoples who have not attained full \nindependence or other self-governing status recognized by the United Nations [\u2026]\u201d. \n98 Dupuy and Vi \u00f1uales (2015) at 84; Birnie et al (2009) at 197-198. \n99 Durner (2001) at 219. \n100 See Art. 137 para. 3 UNCLOS and Durner (2001) at 222-224. \n101 Cf.

However, as of yet no attempt has been made in practice to implement this \nelement.107 \nStatus \nAs the conceptual basis for UNCLOS including the 1994 Implementing Agreement108 and the Moon \nTreaty, the common heritage of mankind is an established legal concept of international law.109 \nConcerning the deep sea-bed, it may additionally reflect customary law. However, this is controversial. \nAccording to one view, it is \u201cstill of doubtful legal status\u201d.110 According to another view, the \ncontroversies related to Part XI of UNCLOS which prevented UNCLOS\u00b4 entry into force for over a \ndecade, including the organisation of the International Seabed Authority, do not question the opinio \niuris of states on the basic elements of the common heritage concept.111 There is no evidence regarding \nstate practice or opinio iuris that the legal status of common heritage of mankind applies to other \nareas.  \nApplicability to abiotic resources and resource efficiency \nWhile the principle of common heritage of mankind applies to the deep sea-bed and to a limited extent \nto the moon112, it relates only to non-living, i.e. abiotic resources.113 It has thus been described as \u201ca \nspecialized regime applied to certain mineral resources\u201d.114 \nResource efficiency is not directly addressed, but could become relevant indirectly (see below under \nassessment). \n \n102 Dupuy and Vi \u00f1uales (2015) at 84. \n103 Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, 16 November 1972 (World Heritage \nConvention) entered into force 17 December 1975 United Nations Treaty Series, vol. 1037, at 151.

As a starting point, its main element is the \ncommon management of the area concerned,115 and it is directed at exploiting the area\u2019s resources116 \nand sharing the benefits, which impedes resource efficiency. However, similar to the principle of \ncommon areas and the equitable utilisation of shared resources, free exploitation is restricted at least \nto some extent by the interest of other states, which could to some extent restrict inefficient use, for \ninstance if one state were to use up a resource completely. More specific duties and obligations in this \nregard are not intrinsic to this concept, but they are part of the provisions common the common \nheritage regimes of the deep seabed and the moon and woul in any event arise from by the general \nduty of environmental protection for the relevant areas.117 Accordingly, there may be a link, at least to \nsome extent, between this duty and resource conservation, subject to the reflections made above in \nthe context of the principle of common areas. However, so far there are but few indications that that \ncommon management has a conservation component. In academic literature it has been observed that \nthe central weakness of the common heritage concept is that \u201cit is motivated in large parts by state\u00b4s \ndesire for access to resources rather than by genuine community interest in their protection\u201d.118 In the \ncase of the deep seabed, common heritage resources are subject to regulation by an international \nauthority, which might lead to requirements concerning resource efficiency or conservation. \nSummary \nThe principle of common heritage of mankind places the exploitation of certain resources under \ncommon management, intended for the benefit of all states and peoples. It applies to the deep sea-bed \nand the moon and relates only to abiotic resources. The principle of common heritage of mankind does \nnot explicitly or directly address resource efficiency. As a starting point, the common management \naims at exploiting resources and sharing the benefits, which impedes resource efficiency. So far there \nare but few indications that that the concept of common heritage on its own , i.e. without additional \nexplicit provisions, includes further duties and obligations relating to the environment or resource \nefficiency. However, there may be a link, at least to some extent, between the general duty to protect \nthe environment and resource conservation. Taken together, management for the benefit for all and \nenvironmental protection could become the basis for a conservation component that fosters efficiency. \nIn addition, the responsibility of an international authority for the common management might lead to \nrequirements concerning resource efficiency or conservation. Concerning the deep sea-bed, the status \nas common heritage may reflect customary law. \n \n2.1.1.6 Common concern of humankind \nDevelopment and Content \nThe concept of common concern of humankind emerged in the 1990s.119 In contrast to the principles \nanalysed before (permanent sovereignty on natural resources, equitable utilisation of shared natural \nresources, common areas, and common heritage of mankind), it does not regulate the distribution of \n \n115 Matz-L\u00fcck (2010) calls the concept of common heritage of mankind a \u201cmanagement tool\u201c. \n116 With regard to criticism of a potential eco-imperialism see Scholtz (2008). \n117 See Beyerlin and Maraun (2011), at 141. \n118 Brunn\u00e9e (2006) at 563. \n119 See Dupuy and Vi \u00f1uales (2015) at 85 and Durner (2001) at 239 with examples of earlier ideas at 234 et seq. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n61 resources, but aims at environmental protection.120 Basically, the principle of common concern of \nhumankind expresses the common interest of all states in certain forms of ecological protection.121 In \ncontrast to older concepts such as the 1972 Stockholm Declaration that distinguished between \nresponsibilities for areas within and beyond national jurisdiction, the concept of common concern, in \nthe context of the Rio Declaration, designates those issues which involve global responsibilities.122 It \n\u201cremoves the topic from states\u00b4 exclusive domestic jurisdictions and makes it a legitimate matter for \ninternational regulations\u201d.123 Therefore, \u201cthe right and duty of the international community to act in \nmatters of common concern still must be balanced with respect for sovereignty\u201d.124 The main \nexamples of this principle are the 1992 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)125, which has \nrecently been supplemented by the 2015 Paris Agreement, and the 1992 Biodiversity Convention \n(CBD).126 The preamble to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement \u201cacknowledge\u201d that climate change is \na common concern of humankind. The preamble of the CBD includes the following elements related to \nthe principle: \n\u201cAffirming  that the conservation of biological diversity is a common concern of humankind, \nReaffirming  that States have sovereign rights over their own biological resources, \nReaffirming  also that States are responsible for conserving their biological diversity and for \nusing their biological resources in a sustainable manner, [\u2026]\u201d. \nHowever, the exact meaning and the implications of the principle are unclear and debated.127 \nAccording to the most widespread view in literature, the responsibilities related to resources of \ncommon concern, especially duties to protect such resources within the boundaries of national \njurisdiction, have erga omnes effect, i.e. are directed towards the international community as a whole, \nand can be enforced by any other state.128 This is in line with the development of international law \nsince the Rio Declaration that international environmental law is no longer a system merely governing \ntransboundary relations among neighbouring states, but increasingly a system addressing global \nproblems via international and national measures alike.129 However, the implications of this view are \nnot yet settled.130 According to Shaw, the concept of common concern of mankind is weaker and more \nambiguous than the concept common heritage of mankind.131 \nStatus \nConcerning climate change and biological diversity, the principle of common concern of humankind \nmay reflect customary law, which would however be relevant mainly for those states that are not \n \n120 See Durner (2001) at 234; Hey (2016), at 62 et seq. \n121 Birnie et al (2009) at 198. \n122 Birnie et al (2009) at 128. \n123 Kiss and Shelton (2007), at 14. \n124 Kiss and Shelton (2007), at 14. \n125 Preamble to the CBD and UNFCCC; see also the preamble to the 2015 Paris Agreement (Acknowledging that climate \nchange is a common concern of humankind\u201d) cf. also paragraph 1 of UNGA resolution 43/53 of 6 December 1988: \n\u201cRecognizes that climate change is a common concern of mankind, since climate is an essential condition which sustains life \non earth.\u201d \n126 Preamble of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), 5 June 1992, in force 29 December 1993, United Nations, Treaty \nSeries, vol. 1760, 79. \n127 See Durner (2001) at 253 et seq., mentioning eight different views in the literature, and Birnie et al (2009) at 129. \n128 See Durner (2001) at 241, 254, and 260 et seq. referring to the fundamental publication by Kirgis (1990), at 525 et seq. \nSee also Birnie et al (2009) at 130 (\u201cmay have an erga omnes  character\u201d); Kiss and Shelton (2007) at 15: \u201cmay be viewed as \nobligations erga omnes .\u201c An obligations erga omnes see the Barcelona traction case of the ICJ, ICJ Reports 1970, at 4, 32. \n129 See Birnie et al (2009) at 129; Dupuy and Vi \u00f1uales (2015) at 86. \n130 See Durner (2001) at 263 et seq.; Birnie et al (2009) at 129; Beyerlin and Marauhn (2011), at 286 et seq. \n131 Shaw (2008) at 534. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n62 party to the climate regime or the CBD.132 Beyond these fields, no relevant state practice has evolved \nyet. \nApplicability to abiotic resources and resource efficiency \nAs mentioned before, the principle of common concern of humankind is applicable to climate change \nand biological diversity. While the latter addresses living resources, the former relates to \nanthropogenic GHG emissions and is thus relevant to the use of abiotic fossil resources such as coal, oil \nand gas. Moreover, although not explicitly mentioned in the Montreal Protocol, the principle of \ncommon concern may also apply to the ozone layer and the corresponding duties of the Protocol133, \nwhich does however not have a direct impact on the use of abiotic resources.134 Further initiatives to \nextend the principle to the environment as a whole135 are not backed by a corresponding practice.136 \nGenerally, the mere existence of an objective interest of all states is not sufficient. 137 \nThus, the principle of common concern is only indirectly applicable to abiotic resources in the context \nof climate change. As it is specifically mentioned by the treaty provisions of the 2015 Paris Agreement \n(see above), we refer to the subsequent analysis of the Paris Agreement for links to resource efficiency. \nAssessment \nThe principle of common concern of humankind is another principle of international law that restricts \nthe principle of permanent sovereignty over national resources, in this case within the confines of \nglobal responsibility.138 However, so far it has been applied only to climate change and biodiversity \nand appears relevant only in relation to the former. However, the principle is particularly suitable for \nmore general application and may become an important tool for tackling global environmental \nproblems.139 Such a development would, however, require a deeper scientific understanding of the \nprinciple and consensus on its scope of application and its implications.140 \nSummary \nThe principle of common concern of humankind is a more recent concept that differs from other \nprinciples relating to natural resources in that it does not regulate the distribution of resources, but \nexpresses the common interest of all states in certain forms of ecological protection. Its main examples \nare the 1992 Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as specified by the 2015 Paris Agreement, and \nthe Convention on 1992 Biodiversity Convention (CBD). The exact meaning and legal implications of \nthe principle are not settled. According to the most widespread view, the responsibilities related to \nresources of common concern have erga omnes  effect, i.e. are directed towards the international \ncommunity as a whole, and can be enforced by any other state. The principle restricts the principle of \npermanent sovereignty over national resources within the confines of global responsibility. At this \nstage it appears relevant for resource efficiency only in the context of climate change. But it might \n \n132 Durner (2001) at 235. \n133 See Durner (2001) at 274; Birnie et al (2009) at 128. \n134 For more details see the analysis of the Montreal Protocol above. \n135 See notably the proposal by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) of an International Covenant on \nEnvironment and Development, referred to by Durner (2001) at 250-252 with further references. \n136 Durner (2001) at 274-275. \n137 Durner (2001) at 274-275. \n138 See Birnie et al (2009) at 130. \n139 Durner (2001) at 275. \n140 Ibid. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n63 provide political opportunities more generally e.g. if states regarded the conservation of resources \nover time as a common concern. \n \n2.1.1.7 Prevention of transboundary environmental harm \nDevelopment and Content \nAs stated by the ICJ in 2015, a state has the obligation \u201cto use all the means at its disposal in order to \navoid activities which take place in its territory, or in any area under its jurisdiction, causing \nsignificant damage to the environment of another State\u201d.141 \nThe obligation has originally evolved from the Trail Smelter case (1938)142, concerning air pollution, \nand the Corfu Channel Case (1949)143 and has since developed into customary law. The ICJ has \nconfirmed the existence of this general rule in the advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use \nof Nuclear Weapons144, the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros  case145 and the Pulp Mills  case146 and the Costa Rica\u2013\nNicaragua cases.147 The obligation is also expressed in international documents such as the Stockholm \nDeclaration and the Rio Declaration, and reflected in international treaties, such as UNCLOS or CBD.148 \nIt has been called \u201cthe primary or cardinal rule of customary international environmental law\u201d, giving \nrise to many other rules of international environmental law.149 \nWhile the general rule is now well established, there are small but important differences in how it was \nformulated over time. The differences have legal implications for which areas are protected and for \nwhich activities or omissions a state may be responsible. In that sense the precise scope and content of \nthe obligation is not entirely clear:  \nThe wording of principle 2 of the 1992 Rio Declaration principle 2 juxtaposed the obligation to prevent \ntransboundary harm with the right to exploit national natural resources: \u201cStates have, in accordance \nwith the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to \nexploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and developmental policies, and the \nresponsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the \nenvironment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction \u201d.150 The obligation thus \nlimits or counterbalances the sovereignty and the freedom to exploit natural resources. The wording \n\u201cresponsibility to ensure\u201d indicates an obligation of result and is much stronger than the ICJ\u2019s wording \n \n141 Certain Activities carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v.

Another difference to the ICJ wording is that the Rio Declaration not only includes damage to \nother states, but also to areas beyond national jurisdiction. \nThe International Law Commission (ILC) also addressed this obligation, but its Draft Articles on \nTransboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities of 2001151 give it a slightly wider scope: They apply \nwhen (1) the activity in question was not prohibited by international law; (2) it was carried out under \nthe jurisdiction of the state of origin; (3) it involves a risk of causing significant transboundary harm; \nand (4) the harm has been caused by the physical consequences of the activity.152 According to the \nDraft Articles, the obligation is \u201cto take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary \nharm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof\u201d .153 The ILC thus combines measures to prevent \nsignificant transboundary harm with measures to at least minimize the risk thereof. Similar to recent \nICJ judgments, the ILC defines \u201ctransboundary harm\u201d as harm \u201ccaused in the territory of or in other \nplaces under the jurisdiction or control of a State\u201d,154 thus excluding harm to areas beyond national \ncontrol. The ILC also requires \u201csignificant\u201d harm .155  \nAs to the precise content of the obligation, ICJ and ITLOS have clarified that the duty to prevent is an \nobligation of due diligence and therefore an obligation of conduct rather than of result.156 While are \nuncertainties regarding what due diligence would require, the concept of due diligence is well \nestablished and leaves flexibility for each specific case. The ILC Draft Articles and case law provide \nsome examples: due diligence could require states to employ the best available techniques, regulate \nthe activity in question, conduct an environmental impact assessment157, or to cooperate, if there is a \nrisk of transboundary harm.158 The obligation not to cause transboundary harm is not intended for \nbalancing interests of concerned states (i.e. in equitable sharing resources) \u2212 the threshold of \nsignificant harm underlines an absolute obligation.159 \nStatus \nThe obligation not to cause transboundary environmental harm has been recognised by the ICJ as \ncustomary international law.160 \n \n151 Intenational Law Commission (2001), Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities \nwith Commentaries, Yearbook of the International Law Commission  Vol. II, Part Two, 148.

Resource efficiency is not directly \naddressed, but could become relevant indirectly (see below under assessment). \nAssessment \nThe duty to prevent transboundary environmental harm generally limits the freedom of states, but it \ndoes not explicitly or directly cover resource efficiency. However, it could oblige a state to use less of a \nresource or to use the resource more efficiently, if the excessive use of the resource resulted in \nsignificant harm to another state. In this sense the obligation limits the sovereign right of states to \nexploit their resources.162 It is not certain whether and to what extent the obligation would also apply \nin a similar way to resources beyond national jurisdiction or resources with a legal status as a \n\u201ccommon\u201d good (see above). \nScenarios where inefficient use of the resource causes environmental transboundary damage might be \nconceivable in cases of excessive use of a particular resource. However, there is not much practice or \ncase law, particularly in this respect. A breach would require causation, i.e. that the particular use of \nthe resource by the particular state caused significant environmental transboundary harm. In addition, \na breach would also require that the state did not exercise due diligence. Which diligence is \u201cdue\u201d in a \nspecific case would be difficult to ascertain in advance, even more so in cases where the harm was not \ncaused by a specific activity but rather by inefficent or excessive use of a resource over time. It should \nalso be noted that other obligations under international may apply specificially to the activity in \nquestion. They might define or indicate which diligence is required of states, or they might even apply \nas lex specialis and prevail over the obligation to prevent transboundary harm. For instance, if the \nresource in question is a shared resource, due diligence might have to take into account whether an \nexcessive use of it by one state restricts the other states\u2019 right to equitably use that resource. In the \ncase of the climate regime, the absence of specific obligations regarding by how much each indidivdual \nstate has to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, or by which particular measures, could stand in the \nway of potential arguments that e.g. an inefficient use of fossil fuels was a failure to exercise due \ndiligence. On other hand, what would be considered a reasonable standard of due diligence may \nchange with time.163 This openness could therefore provide political opportunities for establishing \nstandards with regard to resource efficiency.  \nSummary \nThe obligation to prevent significant transboundary environmental harm is the core principle of \ninternational environmental law, and serves as a counterpart to the principle of permanent \nsovereignty over natural resources. It covers abiotic resources, but does not directly address resource \nefficiency. Indirectly, the principle could oblige a state to use less of a resource or to use the resource \nmore efficiently, if the excessive use of the resource implied a risk of significant harm to another state. \nIt is not certain whether and to what extent the obligation would also apply in a similar way to \nresources beyond national jurisdiction or resources with a legal status as a \u201ccommon\u201d good. The \n \n161 The ICJ stated in the Nicaragua cases  (para 104): \u201cAlthough the Court\u2019s statement in the Pulp Mills case refers to industrial \nactivities, the underlying principle applies generally to proposed activities which may have a significant adverse impact in a \ntransboundary context. Thus, to fulfil its obligation to exercise due diligence in preventing significant transboundary \nenvironmental harm, a State must, before embarking on an activity having the potential adversely to affect the environment \nof another State, ascertain if there is a risk of significant transboundary harm, which would trigger the requirement to carry \nout an environmental impact assessment.\u201d \n162 Hey (2016) at 59. \n163 ILC Draft Articles Prevention , Art. 3 comm. 11. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n66 principle is important because it is the starting point for a number of other obligations under \ninternational environmental law. The openness of the due diligence standard could provide political \nopportunities with regard to resource efficiency. \n \n2.1.1.8 Sustainable Development \nDevelopment and Content \nThe concept of \u201csustainable development\u201d, in its most commonly used definition, describes \n\u201cdevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future \ngenerations to meet their own needs\u201d.164 Although concepts such as the sustainable use of resources, \nor preservation for the benefit of future generations, date further back, the term \u201csustainable \ndevelopment\u201d gained international recognition through the 1987 Brundtland Commission\u2019s report \n\u201cOur Common Future\u201d.  \nThe concept\u2019s influence on international law became evident in the 1992 Rio Conference and the \nmultilateral environmental agreements adopted at that summit, most prominently the CBD165 and the \nUNFCCC166. Since then, in has been firmly established in political discourse, and is included in a large \nnumber of international agreements. Most do so in the preamble167, as part of the objective168, or citing \nsustainable development as a principle169. A large number of non-binding international instruments \nalso refer to the concept, including the 1992 Rio Declaration, Copenhagen Declaration on Social \nDevelopment, Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development, or the 2005 World Summit \nOutcome. \nToday, sustainable development has been said to be the \u201coverarching framework for improving quality \nof life throughout the world\u201d170. It is important, however, to distinguish the concept as a political \nprogramme from a potential legal principle, as well as the question of legal status from normative \ncontent. With regard to content, there are at least three \u201cinterdependent and mutually reinforcing \npillars\u201d of sustainable development: economic development, social development, and environmental \nprotection.171 Combined with the notion of \u201csustainability\u201d, four elements are commonly cited as part \nof the concept of sustainable development, each of them being potentially relevant for promoting \nresource efficiency:172 \n1. Inter-generational equity: see the section in this report on \u201cinter-generational equity\u201d. \n2. Exploitation of natural resources in a sustainable way: This element has found most \nprominent application in the area of marine living resources, but is also reflected in \nmany other multilateral environmental agreements and increasingly also international \neconomic law.173 Nevertheless, the legal nature of this specific notion is not clear, and \neven where treaties cite the concept, they often do not impose concrete obligations to \nimplement the concept. While there is some evidence that the concept of sustainable \nuse of natural resources in common areas has acquired the status of customary law, it \n \n164 World Commission on Environment and Development (1987): Our Common Future .

Intra-generational equity: In broad terms, this element captures the idea that the \nbenefits of development and responsibilities should be fairly distributed within one \ngeneration. There is no commonly agreed definition of \u201cintra-generational equity\u201d or \nhow it should be translated into action but scholars often make the link to the principle \nof common but differentiated responsibility (see separate Section), the eradication of \npoverty as a priority, \u201cthe right to development\u201d175, or the equitable use of shared \nnatural resources.176 \n4. Integration of environmental, social and economic considerations: This is probably the \nmost commonly accepted element of sustainable development. It reflects the \nunderstanding that environmental protection is an integral part of the development \nprocess. It is reflected in many MEAs and has also been endorsed by the ICJ in the \nGabcikovo-Nagymaros judgment.177 \nThere is considerable disagreement on what these individual elements imply178, and how they could \nbe translated into concrete obligations. As one scholar noticed, \u201cone could ask whether the concept [of \nsustainable development] is so vague as to be meaningless\u201d179. Depending on interpretation, the \nelements might even contradict each other. ICJ Judge Weeramantry thus considered sustainable \ndevelopment to be a \u201cprinciple of reconciliation\u201d180, namely between the law of environment and the \nlaw of development. \nStatus \nDespite of, or perhaps because of, it ubiquitous prominence in environmental and development \ndiscourse and processes, the legal status of the principle of sustainable development is still under \ndebate. Some see it merely as a global policy goal or concept with no normative character; others \ndescribe sustainable development as soft law.181 At the other end of the spectrum is what ICJ Judge \nWeeramantry stated in separate opinion: \u201cI consider [sustainable development] to be more than a \nmere concept, but as a principle with normative value [...]\u201d.182 According to this view, sustainable \ndevelopment is a principle of customary international law.183 Sustainable development has also been \ndescribed as a \u201cmetaprinciple\u201d, a rule for judicial reasoning, namely to take a holistic approach to \ndispute resolution, rather than a norm of conduct.184 \nThe ICJ first referred to sustainable development in the Gacikovo-Nagymaros Case but was cautious \nnot to explicitly positioning itself with respect to its legal character. The ICJ noted that \u201cnew norms and \nstandards have been developed [...]\u201d and that there was a \u201cneed to reconcile economic development \n \n174 Birnie et al.

While the ICJ did recommend to use the concept, the ICJ did not state that sustainable \ndevelopment was a principle or rule of customary international law.  \nApplicability to abiotic resources and resource efficiency \nThe concept of sustainable development is applicable to all resources. The element of sustainable use \nmight suggest that at least non-renewable resources should not be exploited at all, simply because \ntheir extraction is not sustainable. Other elements of the concept of sustainable development highlight \nthe right to development, which might include the extraction of resources. Sustainable development \ntherefore does not per se require states to preserve resources, but to balance environmental and \ndevelopment interests, and to consider the needs of future generations when exploiting the resources. \nOn this basis am argument could be made that if states decide to exploit resources, one aspect of \nsustainable development implies making efficient use of them in order to conserve them for present \nand future use. However, the concept does not establish clear normative guidance to deduce from it \nclear obligations on resource efficiency. It may serve as an a general counterweight to the sovereign \nright to exploit natural resources and as an argument that there is a limit to this right, even though the \nlimit remains abstract and is not specified in concrete terms.  \nAssessment \nThe concept of sustainable development provides ground to argue that states may exploit their \nresources but need to use them efficiently. However, it does not provide clear normative guidance in \nthis respect. First, it is contested whether sustainable development is already part of customary \ninternational law. Second, the precise content of the concept is subject to debate. While there seems to \nbe agreement that the concept aims to balance environmental concerns against development, the \nconcept does not provide guidance on which of these objectives should prevail. \nWhether and to what extent the concept of sustainable development has a specific normative legal \ncontent is still under debate. There is no consensus, for example, as to whether the concept would \nprohibit certain activities. However, it is of high political relevance.186  \nSummary \nWhile \u201csustainable development\u201d has been cited in nearly every international document concerning \nenvironment or development in the last decades, there is no agreement, in particular in state practice, \nwhether it qualifies as a principle of customary international law or as to its specific legal content. In \ntheory, the concept appears to be highly relevant to the efficient use of abiotic resources because it \nasks states to consider environmental protection when pursuing development policies. But the \nconcept and its individual elements remain so vague that it does not provide specific normative \nguidance to states. Its main relevance for resource efficiency is to serve as a counterweight to the \nsovereign right to exploit natural resources and as an argument that there is a limit to this right, \nalthough the limit remains abstract and is not specified in concrete terms.  \n \n \n185 Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project  (Hungary v.

According to Dupuy and Vi\u00f1uales, the principle of inter-\ngenerational equity \u201caims to distribute the quality and availability of natural resources and the \nnecessary efforts for their conservation between the present and future generations\u201d.187 \nThe concept is referred to in substance in early international environmental and wildlife treaties, for \nexample in the 1946 International Whaling Convention which recognizes \u201cthe interests of the nations \nof the world in safeguarding whale stocks for future generations\u201d188, and in the 1972 World Heritage \nConvention.189 More recent treaties incorporating the principle include amongst others the 1992 \nBiodiversity Convention190 and explicitly the 2015 Paris Agreement191. Moreover, the principle is \nexpressed in Principle 1 of the Stockholm Declaration, and Principle 3 of the Rio Declaration according \nto which \u201c[t]he right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and \nenvironmental needs of present and future generations\u201d.192 Today, the principle of inter-generational \nequity is usually considered as one of the elements of the principle of sustainable development.193  \nThe basic concept that environmental goods should be preserved for future use is not new. It has long \nbeen applied, for instance, in German forest management and enshrined in forest law.194 Yet theories \nof distributional justice continue to provide the underpinning for defining what intergenerational \nequity could mean in normative and legal terms.195 Conceptual issues include whether and how a state \nshould pursue distributional justice, whether this also applies to inter-generationally across time, and \nwhether this applies internationally across states. For instance, most theories of distributional justice \nare based on the assumption that there is a central institution that has the power to distribute. This \ncannot simply be applied to international law, which is a horizontal legal order of sovereign states \nwithout a central authority.196 In terms of pursuing justice across time, problems include lack of \nknowledge, the lack of opportunity to cooperate with future generations and the asymmetric influence \nbetween the current and the future generations.197 At the national level, some countries have taken \nstep to address and implement intergenerational equity. For instance, Israel and France have set up \ninstitutions representing future generations.198 In Germany, the Sustainability Council includes \ngenerational equity in its policy recommendations199 and the German Government includes indicators \n \n187 Dupuy and Vi \u00f1uales (2015) at 77. \n188 See the Preamble to International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, 2 December 1946, in force 10 October 1948, \nUnited Nations Treaty Series , vol. 161, p. 72. \n189 See Art. 4 of Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (World Heritage \nConvention), 16 November 1972, in force 17 December 1975, United Nations Treaty Series , vol. 1037, p. 151. \n190 Preamble of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), 5 June 1992, in force 29 December 1993, United Nations, Treaty \nSeries, vol. 1760, 79. \n191 Preamble of the Paris Agreement, 12 December 2015, in force 4 November 2016, C.N.92.2016.TREATIES-XXVII.7.d, \navailable at https://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/2016/02/20160215%2006-03%20PM/Ch_XXVII-7-d.pdf.  \n192 \u201cRio Declaration on Environment and Development\u201d, Rio de Janeiro, 13 June 1992, UN Doc.

In contrast, international practice does not \nsupport the third element.204 However, recognising the first two elements in abstract does not solve \nthe problem of finding the right balance between the present and future generations in the \ndistribution of resources.205 \nStatus \nAs with its content, the legal status of a potential \u201cprinciple\u201d of inter-generational equity is \nuncertain.206 Some argue that future generations have been endowed with justiciable rights in \ninternational law.207 Such a right has already been granted under national laws by the Philippines \nSupreme Court.208 At the international level, focusing on legal rights and potential standing of future \ngenerations is difficult because principle 3 of the Rio-Declaration is not binding and because future \ngenerations would have to be represented somehow.209 The issue is linked to the more general, and \nequally unclear status of the principle of sustainable development in international law.210 In particular, \nwhile the ICJ referred in the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project case  to \u201cpresent and future generations\u201d in \nthe context of the awareness of risks of interventions in nature, it referred to sustainable development \nonly as a concept and not as a principle with normative force.211 Accordingly, Sands doubts that the \nconcern for future generations has practical legal consequences.212 This is in line with the practice of \ninternational courts where so far cases involving present generations have only been linked to \nactivities of the past.213  \n \n200 Bundesregierung (2017). \n201 Pogge (1998).

Notwithstanding the uncertainties as to its exact content, the principle \nof inter-generational equity may therefore guide present generations to use resources responsibly, \nwhich would also mean efficiently in view of the interests of future generations. \nSummary \nThe principle of inter-generational equity is based on the idea that the environment and resources \nhave to be protected also for the benefit of future generations. Nowadays it is usually considered as \none of the elements of the principle of sustainable development. Both its legal status and content are \nuncertain. The principle of inter-generational equity does not explicitly or directly address resource \nefficiency. However, it is important conceptually insofar as resource efficiency can contribute to \nconservation of resources for future generations. In guiding present generations to use resources \nresponsibly, the principle could therefore also include efficiency as one element of taking into account \nthe interests of future generations. Despite the conceptual relevance, concrete political opportunities \nfor anchoring resource efficiency appear to be small. The principle could perhaps be used in \ninterpreting norms and concepts that focus on allocation aspects and to add the notion of conservation \nover time. \n \n2.1.1.10 Polluter pays principle \nDevelopment and Content \nThe polluter pays principle embodies the concept that the \u201ccosts of the pollution should be born by the \nperson responsible for causing the pollution\u201d.215 It brings together the notion of the \u201ctragedy of the \ncommons\u201d and a view in economic theory that environmental harm is caused because the costs \nassociated with using and polluting the environment were \u201cexternal\u201d to the polluter and should be \ninternalised. It is, however, open for debate in which cases the principle should be applied, which costs \nshould be covered or who would be the person responsible.216 The principle is closely related to the \nobligation not to cause transboundary harm and to liability, and provides the basis for later discussion \non economic policy instruments.217 \nThe polluter pays principle was first explicitly mentioned in an international document in the OECD \nCouncil Recommendation on Guiding Principles concerning the International Economic Aspects of \nEnvironmental Policies (1972). The OECD recommended that the costs of goods and services should \n \n214 See Dupuy and Vi \u00f1uales (2015) 77, cited in the text above. \n215 Sands (2003) at 279. \n216 Sands (2003) at 280. \n217 Sands (2003) at 159. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n72 cover the costs of environmental protection measures, while not necessarily the costs of \nenvironmental damage.218 \nThe strongest support for the principle can be observed in Europe, where the (then) European \nCommunity adopted the principle in its 1st environmental action programme of 1973. In 1975, the EC \nCouncil recommended to the EC and Member States to apply the principle and to give it a broader \nscope than the OECD: the polluter should pay for the costs of eliminating pollution.219 The EEC treaty \nof 1986 explicitly provided that environmental action should be based on the polluter-pays principle. \n220 \nAt global level, the principle was adopted as Principle 16 of the Rio Declaration which states that \nenvironmental costs should be internalised, \u201ctaking into account that the polluter should, in principle, \nbear the costs of pollution\u201d. The soft wording of Principle 16, including many caveats, reflects the \nuneasiness some states felt with regard to the concept generally, and particularly with regard to \napplying it beyond the domestic level, i.e. between states. 221  \nSeveral international treaties such as the Helsinki Convention on Transboundary Watercourses, the \n1991 Alps Convention, the 1992 Baltic Sea Convention, 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, or the 1985 \nASEAN Convention, make reference to the polluter-pays principle but mostly without further defining \nits specific implications or application.222 \nOpen questions include (1) which costs would be covered, i.e. whether decontamination, clean-up and \nreinstatement would be included; and (2) which exceptions applied. 223 With respect to the latter, it has \nbeen argued that \u201ca great deal of flexibility will be inevitable\u201d in applying and implementing the \nprinciple. While strict liability would be the closest translation of the principle, in practice its \napplication would need to reflect the differences in risks and the economic feasibility, especially with \nregard to high risk technologies.224 \nStatus \nAs with other principles, the question of legal status is distinct from the question of specific content. It \nis doubtful whether the principle has required the status of a principle of customary international law, \nespecially with respect to its application at the inter-state level. 225 But it might have become regional \ncustomary law in the EU, UNECE and OECD countries.226 \nIn this case, there is a range of views on its legal status and nature. Some argue that the polluter pays \nconcept was a clear normative rule instead of a mere principle that guides interpretation.227 Others \nhold that the principle, at least as reflected in Rio Principle 16, \u201csimply lacks the normative character \nof a rule of law\u201d, and that no general pattern of state practice is discernible.228  \n \n218 Sands (2003) at 281. \n219 Council Recommendation 75/436/EURATOM, ECSC, EEC of 3 March 1975, Annex para 2. \n220 For the recent development see Sadeleer (2015). \n221 Sands (2003) at 281. \n222 See the list in Beyerlin and Marauhn (2011) at 57 and 58. \n223 Sands (2003) at 285. \n224 Birnie et al.

There is no indication that the principle is \nsupposed to be applied only to \u201cpollution\u201d in the narrow sense, i.e. where substances are introduced \ninto the environment, which would exclude \u201cover-use\u201d of resources.229 However, there are several \ndefinitions of the principle and there is no coherent state practice regarding its specific application. \nFor instance, since exceptions or limitations apply to most areas of legal liability, this could also be an \nissue for applying the polluter pays principle. Resource efficiency is not directly addressed, but could \nbecome relevant indirectly (see below under assessment). \nAssessment \nThe polluter pays principle essentially aims at providing economic disincentives to causing \nenvironmental harm. The principle is mainly directed at how states should address the costs for \nenvironmental pollution and polluting private parties - i.e. by internalising external environmental \ncosts. However, it does not explicitly or directly cover resource efficiency. There are basically two \nways in which the principle could have an impact on resource efficiency: \nFirst, internalising external costs of environmental harm along the value chain could provide an \nincentive to increase reource efficiency. It is likely that currently the cost of resource extraction and \npotentially also their use do not fully internalise environmental costs. In cases where applying the \npolluter pays principle would make extraction and potentially other parts of the value chain more \nexpensive, it might, although not necessarily, in turn result in less or more efficient extraction, \nprocessing and use in order to avoid costs. For instance, if the polluter pays principle led a state to \nincrease the costs associated with generating waste, private actors might choose to increase resource \nefficiency as one way to generate less waste and thus avoid cost increases. \nSecond, the polluter principle could be directly applied to inefficiency as such. Inefficiency would be \ntreated as contributing to environmental harm, an inefficient user would be treated like a \u201cpolluter\u201d, \nand the environmental costs caused by the inefficency would be internalised. However, this would \nrequire careful consideration of at least the following issues: (i) which environmental harm should be \nattributed to inefficiency, e.g. how to define whose, and which, inefficiency causes how much increase \nin demand for resources, and which incremental costs are caused by this increase? (ii) How to avoid \nthat multiple \u201cpolluters\u201d have to internalise costs for the same environmental harm? These questions \ncannot be resolved by reference to the polluter pays principle alone. For instance, when a mine \nincreases production and thus the environmental costs, several actors other than the operator of the \nmine could be held to be inefficient \u201cpolluters\u201d that cause the incremental costs - e.g. manufacturers \ndown the value chain or consumers whose inefficient lifestyle increases demand for these goods. Who \nis the polluter is thus a normative question that is not determined by the polluter pays principle on its \nown.230 It is therefore difficult to define cases in which inefficiency \u201ccauses\u201d environmental harm in the \nlegal sense. In theory, the principle could apply perhaps in cases of excessive use of the resource. \nThere is such a broader interpretation of the principle, which argues that it \u201calready includes recovery \nof both environmental and resource costs.\u201d231 Mainly in respect of the EC Water Framework Directive, \nthis view argues that the principle does not require damage and that \u2018the use of natural resources\u2019 \nmight also be covered by the term \u2018pollution\u2019.232 This interpretation of the principle would need to take \ninto account that it blurs the conceptual distinction between paying for damage caused to the \n \n229 Cf.

There is no indication that this broad interpretation has so far gained \ntraction in international environmental law. \nSummary \nThe polluter pays principle expresses the economic approach of internalising external costs and is \nmainly directed at how states should address private parties. Having to bear (i.e. internalise) the costs \nof pollution is intended to be a disincentive to pollute. It is doubtful whether the principle has the \nstatus of customary international law. However, it is recognized on a regional level in the EU, UNECE \nand OECD countries. With regard to content, while the principle would generally cover abiotic \nresources, who is the polluter is a normative question that is not determined by the polluter pays \nprinciple on its own. Using the principle to address inefficiency, either directly or by analogy, would \nmean that inefficiency would be treated as contributing to environmental harm, an inefficient user \nwould be treated like a \u201cpolluter\u201d, and the environmental costs caused by the inefficency would be \ninternalised. There is no indication that this broad interpretation has so far gained traction in \ninternational environmental law. \n \n2.1.1.11 Precautionary principle \nDevelopment and Content \nWhile there is no uniform formulation or usage for the precautionary principle, the general idea is that \nlack of scientific certainty about actual or potential environmental impacts should not prevent states \nfrom taking approprite measures.233 Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration states: \u201cIn order to protect the \nenvironment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their \ncapabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty \nshall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental \ndegradation.\u201d  \nThe precautionary principle is enshrined in several treaties and non-binding instruments. In the \nLondon Protocol, Article 3.1 requires the application of the precautionary approach. In the \nBiodiversity Convention, the precautionary approach has been introduced recognizing that \u201cwhere \nthere is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity, lack of full scientific certainty \nshould not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat\u201d. In article \n3(3) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the precautionary \napproach is generally considered as intending to prevent states from postponing mitigation measures \nby referring to scientific uncertainty about climate change. The UNFCCC is of general relevance \nbecause it incorporates the precautionary principle in the operative part of a treaty text with near \nuniversal participation, including the US. \nThe precautionary principle has been called \u201cnotoriously difficult to define\u201d, with no generally \naccepted definition.234 Even an internationally agreed and long-established wording such as in the Rio \nDeclaration raises questions of interpretation and application. For instance, would it be a self-standing \nobligation or merely influence the interpretation of other obligations? Would it imply an obligation to \ntake action or merely serve as a (legal) justification for such measures in the absence of scientific \ncertainty?235 Would it justify \"precautionary\" measures that trade off one environmental risk against \n \n233 Dupuy and Vi \u00f1uales (2015) at 61. \n234 Scotford (2017) at 81. \n235 Cf. the overview of views in Dupuy and Vi \u00f1uales (2015) at 61-62. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n75 another?236 To some extent these questions are inherent in a concept of \u201cprinciples\u201d in which it is their \nnature to be neither precise in content nor to provide clear legal consequences. \nThere is also a more fundamental critique of limiting the precautionary principle to cases of scientific \nuncertainty. Some scholars in particular in the German legal context argue that the precautionary \napproach also addresses also related to resources. According to this view, the precautionary approach \nconceptually includes an unspecified but absolute limit to resource use - a requirement to maintain a \n\u201cfree space\u201c - for the sake of future generations.237 This notion could also be regarded as one element \nof sustainable development, to which this view adds the economic aspect of the distribution of \nresources.238 However, this view does not seem to have gained traction in legal practice in Germany or \nEU law239, which also explicitly enshrines the precautionary principle. Given the growing recognition \nof the need for addressing the scarcity of resources, it could be worth revisiting such a resource-\nrelated understanding of the precautionary approach. \nThe precautionary principle has also been invoked in relation to the burden of proof. For instance, it \nhas been argued that when a proposed  activity has the potential for irreversible and catastrophic harm, \nthe burden of proof to show that it is safe to implement should be placed on those proposing the action \nto show that it is safe, instead of requiring those opposing the activity to show that it is not safe.240 \nHowever, the practical implications of shifting the burden of proof based on the precautionary \nprinciple would need to be further elaborated. The precautionary principle could also be invoked to \nease or even shift the burden of proof after environmental impacts have occurred. For instance, a state \nwould have to rebut a legal assumption that its activity caused the alleged environmental harm.241 \nSectoral applications of the precautionary principle under specific regimes may adopt such or similar \nlegal implications.242 However, there are not sufficient state practice and precedents to suggest that \ninternational law generally requires a state to prove that activities within its jurisdiction or control are \nenvironmentally safe.243 In the Pulp mills on the river Uruguay case, the ICJ accepted that a \nprecautionary approach (it did not use the term \u201cprinciple\u201d) \u201cmay be relevant\u201d in the interpretation \nand application of the treaty in question. However, the court also stated that \u201cit does not follow that it \noperates as a reversal of the burden of proof\u201d.244 The wording of the court is not clear as to whether \nthis applies to the specific case or generally excludes a reversal.245 \nRickels et al. argue that the precautionary principle can serve to balance conflicting objectives: In this \nview, because the precautionary principle(s) in different instruments can be satisfied to different \ndegrees, they therefore allow for determining which degree of environmental damage can be accepted \nin order to advance for instance the comprehensive goal of climate protection.246 This view appears to \n \n236 For the UNFCCC, the specific wording of the precautionary principle could be read as supporting an argument in favour of \nactivities that pose risks to the environment, provided that these activities are intended to mitigate the causes and effects of \nclimate See analysis in Bodle et al (2012) at 119-120; Bodle (2013) at 458-459. \n237 L\u00fcbbe-Wolff NVwZ 1998, 777 (779 f.); Appel NVwZ 2001, 395 (397); Erbguth and Schlacke, Umweltrecht (2016) at 51; \nalso Nettesheim in Grabitz, Hilf and Nettesheim, EUV/AEUV, Art. 191 para 94; Epiney in Landmann/Rohmer, EUV/AEUV \nArt. 191 para 10. \n238 Nettesheim in Grabitz/Hilf/Nettesheim, EUV/AEUV, Art. 191 para 94. \n239 Nettesheim in Grabitz/Hilf/Nettesheim, EUV/AEUV, Art. 191 para 94; Epiney in Landmann/Rohmer, EUV/AEUV Art. 191 \npara 10, Verschuuren (2003) at 115. \n240 Bodansky (2011) 15. \n241 Bodle et al (2012) at 115-116. \n242 See for instance ITLOS case No.17, \u201dResponsibilities and obligations of States sponsoring persons and entities with respect \nto activities in the Area (Request for Advisory Opinion submitted to the Seabed Disputes Chamber)\u201d, para 125-135, \nhttp://www.itlos.org; Jessen (2012) 77. \n243 Birnie et al (2009) 158.  \n244 ICJ, Pulp mills on the river Uruguay , para 164. \n245 Bodle (2012) at 115-116.  \n246 Rickels et al.

On the other \nhand, it has been argued that if the precautionary principle is applied in isolation, there is a risk of \nperpetuating the scientific uncertainty that gives rise to its application in the first place.248  \nIt should be noted that the precautionary principle is part of EU law and of many national legal orders, \nand but these instances do not necessarily have the same legal content and implications as the \nprecautionary approach in international law.249 \nStatus \nAs with other principles, the question of legal status is distinct from the question of specific content. \nThe legal status of the precautionary principle in customary international law is not yet clearly \nestablished, although it has been invoked several times in international cases.250 This is highlighted by \nthe fact that some, including the ICJ, avoid or reject the term precautionary \u201c principle\u201d and use the \nterm \u201capproach \u201d.251  \nApplicability to abiotic resources and resource efficiency \nThe principle does not specifically include or exclude resources. It potentially applies to all activities \ninvolving resources along the whole value chain.  \nAssessment \nConceptual legal uncertainties regarding the precautionary principle, as well as its openness regarding \ncontent, make it difficult to draw conclusions without imputing desired outcomes.252 The most \ncommonly invoked implication is that scientific uncertainty should not by itself be a reason to avoid \nrestricting potentially harmful activities. For resource efficiency, this could mean that measures should \nbe taken to address inefficient resource use even if there is scientific uncertainty about its specific \nimpacts. However, there does not seem to be scientific uncertainty about the link between inefficient \nresource use and demand for resources. Perhaps the principle could be used as an argument in cases \nwhere that link and the ensuing environmental degradation is disputed. But the precautionary \nprinciple is no substitute for balancing or prioritising different objectives. All the common ground it \ncan currently provide is to establish interpretative guidance and procedural safeguards for dealing \nwith scientific uncertainty. At least in the current state of international law, the precautionary \nprinciple does not provide a sufficient legal tool for making essentially political decisions about \nconflicting objectives and managing risks.253 \n \n247 Birnie et al.

FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n77 Against this background, the practical implications of the precautionary principle, as it stands, for \nresource efficiency seem small. However, there are views particularly in the German legal debate \narguing that the precautionary approach also contains a resource-related element and limits to \nresource use. While these views have not gained traction at the international level, it could be worth \nrevisiting that argument in view of the increasing recognition of limited resources and resource \nefficiency as a common and overarching objective. This could strengthen arguments based on the \nprecautionary principle to justify measures to address inefficiency, e.g. when interpreting norms that \naim at conserving resources or at reducing environmental impacts resulting from increased demand. \nSummary \nThere is no uniform formulation or usage for the precautionary principle and its legal status in \ncustomary international law has not yet been clearly established. All the common ground it can \ncurrently provide is to establish interpretative guidance and procedural safeguards for dealing with \nscientific uncertainty, which is of little relevance to resource efficiency. However, in that sense it might \nbe used as an argument to justify measures to address inefficiency, e.g. when interpreting norms that \naim at conserving resources or at reducing environmental impacts resulting from increased demand. \n \n2.1.1.12 Common but differentiated responsibility \nDevelopment and Content \nThe principle of common but differentiated responsibility (CBDR) captures the political proposition \nthat obligations in international environmental law should not necessarily apply equally to all states, \nbut that higher standards should apply to some states.254 It contains two elements: First, it expresses \nthe common obligation of states to protect the environment where the environmental resources is \nshared between two or more states, or of a common concern (e.g. the atmosphere, biodiversity, the \nozone layer).255 CBDR thus derives from the principle of cooperation.256 Second, the principle \nrecognises that states have different responsibilities with respect to environmental problems, \nresulting in differentiated legal obligations. The different responsibilities might result from different \nhistorical or current contributions to the problem, and different stages of development and \ncorresponding capacities or needs of states.257 There are different views on which of these factors the \nCBDR principle is based.258 \nWhile the idea of a common interest or of differential treatment has been present in international law \nfor some decades, the CBDR principle as such was first reflected in the 1992 UNFCCC,259 and Principle \n7 of the Rio Declaration. The wording of the principle slightly varies: Rio Declaration states the \ncommon but differentiated responsibilities, while the UNFCCC adds \u201cand respective capabilities\u201d. \nThese variations reflect the different weight put on historical responsibility, on the one hand, and \ncapacities or needs, on the other. More recent MEAs also highlighty the \u201ccircumstances\u201d of countries: \nthe 2013 Minamata Convention recalls in its preamble the Rio principle of CBDR while adding \n\u201cacknowledging States\u2019 respective circumstances and capabilities and the need for global action \u201c.260 \n \n254 Birnie et al.

Rajamani notes that the principle is rather \u201cdiscretionary or guiding\u201d than \nprescriptive, and also Birnie et al. highlight that the principle might not suffice as a basis for interstate \nclaims but as a \u201cframework principle\u201d.262 In the climate regime, the CBDR principle has undoubtedly \nshaped the development of the regime, e.g. when establishing quantified emission reduction \nobligations under the Kyoto Protocol only for developed countries263 or differentiated reporting and \nfinance obligations. In addition, many MEAs establish differentiated responsibilities, even where the \nprinciple is not explicitly spelled out.264 \nIt is particularly controversial whether CBDR does not only provide for higher standards for developed \ncountries but whether it does or should also generally entail an obligation by developed countries to \nprovide financial or technical assistance.265 \nStatus \nThe legal status of the principle of common but differentiated responsibility is controversial. Although \nthe CBDR principle is reflected in the operative part of international treaties, the wording often \nsuggests that the parties did consider the principle not as one of general customary law but only as \napplicable to the specific context of that treaty, e.g. the UNFCCC.266 The wording of the Rio Declaration \nis broader but not binding. On the other hand, the inclusion of differential treatment in a range of \nMEAs with nearly universal participation267 might also indicate that the CBDR principle \u201cis the bedrock \nof the burden sharing arrangements crafted in the new generation of environmental treaties\u201d.268 At \nleast where the principle is included in an MEA it can arguably serve as guidance for the interpretation \nand application of the respective treaty.269  \nApplicability to abiotic resources and resource efficiency \nGiven the uncertain legal nature of the CBDR principle, it would be difficult to argue that the principle \nwas applicable to all activities involving abiotic resources. In the context of the regimes that refer to \nthe principle, CBDR could become relevant to activities relating to resource efficiency in the use of \nabiotic resources.  \nAssessment \nThe principle of CBDR serves the political purpose of including developing countries in international \nenvironmental obligations. It enables parties to differentiate obligations according to factors such as \nhistorical contribution to the problem and capacity. It provides a basis for distributing efforts rather \n \ndifferentiated responsibilities, and acknowledging States\u2019 respective circumstances and capabilities and the need for global \naction\u201c. \n261 Brunn\u00e9e and Streck (2013).

However, state practice does not suggest that there \nis a legal requirement to differentiate. In addition, the grounds for and elements of differentiation vary \nacross issues and change over time, as recent treaties show. The application of the principle to \nresource efficiency could, for example, entail that developed countries increase the efficient use of \nfossil fuels at a higher pace than developing countries, or that they phase down the use of certain \nresources earlier. Such differentiated obligations would, however, usually require further negotiations \namong states rather than emanating from the principle per se.  \nSummary \nWhile historically the principle mainly served as a basis for differentiating between developed and \ndeveloping countries, state practice does not suggest that there is a legal requirement to differentiate. \nWith regard to establishing resource efficiency in international environmental governance, CBDR \ncould be useful in considerung differentiated standards and increase political buy-in in particular by \ndeveloping countries. However, the grounds for and elements of differentiation vary across issues and \nchange over time and resource efficiency might call for other or additional factors to be taken into \naccount.  \n \n2.1.1.13 State responsibility \nDevelopment and Content \nThe rules on state responsibility regulate whether there has been a breach of international law and the \nlegal consequences of that breach. They are secondary rules and general in nature, applying to all \ntypes of binding primary norms (e.g. obligation to prevent transboundary harm), acts and omissions, \nor areas of international law.270 \nIn 1928 the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) established in the Chorzow Factory case \nthe general principle that states have to make reparation for an illegal act, and that principle was later \naffirmed by the ICJ in the Gabcykovo Nagymaros case.271 States have to make reparations for injuries \ncaused by the breach of an international obligation \u2013 under certain conditions.272 According to the \nrules of state responsibility codified by the ILC, (1) the conduct in question must be attributable to the \nstate, (2) the conduct must constitute a breach of an international obligation of that state, and (3) no \ncircumstances may prevail that could preclude the wrongfulness (e.g. force majeure). The legal \ncosequence is that the state responsible is under a new obligation to cease the internationally \nwrongful act and make full reparation for injuries caused.273 The forms of reparation include \nrestitution, compensation and satisfaction, separately or in combination. The ICJ has referred to these \nelements in several occasions and they are widely undisputed.274  \n \n270 Fitzmaurice (2007) at 1016. \n271 Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project  (Hungary v. Slovakia), I.C.J.

The \nInternational Law Commission\u2019s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts \nof 2001 for the most part reflect customary law, although some details may not be universally \naccepted.275 \nApplicability to abiotic resources and resource efficiency \nThe rules on state responsibility are secondary rules applying to any breach of international law and \nare thus not limited to any specific subject area. They apply to any primary obligation that covers \nabiotic resources and addresses resource efficiency. For resource efficiency, the actions of private \nactors are particularly relevant. The conduct of private actors is not directly attributable but the state \nmight be responsible for not exercising due diligence in controlling the private actorunder its \njurisdiction.276  \nAssessment \nThe rules on state responsibility are important secondary rules and contribute to enforcing primary \nrules. Their effectiveness is, however, dependent on the quality of the primary rule, i.e. its specificity. \nIn international environmental law primary rules are often vaguely phrased which makes it difficult to \nestablish a breach with certainty and apply the rules of state responsibility. Furthermore, it is often a \nlegal challenge to establish the causual link between the harmful act and the damage.277 \nFor the specific case of international environmental law, the question of standing becomes particularly \nrelevant. According to the rules of state responsibility, it is the injured state that may invoke the \nresponsibility of another state.278 A breach of international environmental law, e.g. climate change law, \nmay have impacts on a wider group of states or the international community as a whole. In case of \ndamages to global environmental goods or goods of common concern it is not clearly established who \nwould enjoy standing for invoking the breach of such erga omnes obligations.279 \nRestitution will often not be a realistic remedy for breaches of environmental law, and there are high \nuncertainties surrounding the appropriate level of compensation costs, especially if damage reaches \nbeyond economic loss or damage to property.280 For instance, the depletion of natural resources has \nbeen addressed through compensation claims.281 \nState responsibility provides a basic legal framework to address breaches and may also serves as a \ndisincentive for breaches. Where there are no clearly established primary obligations relating to \nresource efficiency, the still open debate could be relevant whether states can be responsible for \ndamage caused by activities that are lawful but nevertheless hazardous.282 However, besides issues \nregarding no-fault liability, this would also raise questions of when inefficient use of a resource \namounts to risky conduct and when it \u201ccauses\u201d harm.  \n \n275 For instance, Ipsen in: Ipsen (2014) at 578 holds that the Draft Articles on the legal consequences are \u201cfor a good part\u201d \ncustomary law, albeit without stating which parts are not.  \n276 See Shaw (2008) at 789; see for the link to the due diligence concept Christiansen (2016) at 48. \n277 See for the details Kiss and Shelton (2007) at 20; Plakokefalos (2015). \n278 ILC, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UN Doc.

FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n81 Summary \nThe rules on state responsibility are secondary rules to enforce primary rules: they determine \nwhether there has been a breach of a primary rule of international law and what the consequences of \nthat breach are. Their effectiveness -and their potential impact on resource efficiency- thus depends \non the nature the primary rules which they intend to help enforce. Where there are no clearly \nestablished primary obligations relating to resource efficiency, it could be relevant to revisit the \ndebate on whether states can be responsible for damage caused by activities that are lawful but \nnevertheless hazardous. As in other concepts and obligations, this would also raise questions of when \ninefficient use of a resource amounts to risky conduct and when it \u201ccauses\u201d harm in the legal sense. \n \n2.1.2 Treaty law \n \n2.1.2.1 London Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes \nand other Matter  \nTable 1:  1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of \nWastes and other Matter, 1972 (in force since 24 March 2006) \nKey aspects  Summary  \nForm and legal status binding, in force \nObjectives Protecting the marine environment from all sources of pollution, especially \ndumping and incineration \n Parties 48 countries that have ratified, but not US and Russia \nTerritorial scope Global \nResources covered Material and substance of any kind, form or description \nStage of the value chain  waste disposal; production-processes and waste recovery, only indirectly \naddressed \nSteering mechanism Regulation (prohibition and permit system), information, cooperation  \nPolitical weight ++  \nwidespread ratification as well as coverage of world shipping tonnage (but \nnot US and Russia); international minimum standards for all states for the \nregulation of pollution of the marine environment by dumping. \nRelevance for RE +++  \nprohibition and restriction of waste dumping creates economic incentive for \nRE \nSummary \nThe 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and \nOther Matter, 1972 (London Protocol) targets pollution of the sea caused by dumping or incineration \nof wastes, including abiotic wastes, in order to protect the marine environment. As a rule, the Protocol \nprohibits waste dumping at sea unless one of the exceptions set out in the Protocol apply. For certain \nwastes, a permit for dumping may be issued under certain conditions, in particular certain measures \nto avoid dumping in favour of more environmentally friendly waste management options such as \nwaste prevention and recovery.  FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n82 In prohibiting the export and import of hazardous waste by default, and subjecting it to permit \nconditions for certain wastes, the London Protocol makes it more expensive to dispose of such wastes. \nThis creates an economic incentive to produce less waste and to recover more, which both leads to \nmore resource efficiency. This incentive is strengthened by the permit conditions which include \nmeasures to prevent waste generation and recovery. Thus, the main regulatory technique of the \nLondon Protocol is not a direct obligation to produce less waste and recover more but the creation of \neconomic incentives to do so.  \nAlthough the Protocol has not yet been ratified by the US, Russia and several developing states, its 48 \nparties cover almost 40% of the gross tonnage of the world\u2019s merchant fleet, and dumping at sea is no \nlonger perceived as legitimate. The Protocol is considered effective and thus creates effective \nincentives to improve resource efficiency. \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  The Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by \nDumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972283 (\u201cLondon Protocol\u201d) is an international treaty that was \nadopted in November 1996 and entered into force on 24 March 2006. The London Protocol \nsupplements the 1972 Dumping Convention284 and provides that it will supersede the latter for those \nparties that have ratified both agreements.285 So far, 48 states have ratified the Protocol, covering \nalmost 40% of the gross tonnage of the world\u2019s merchant fleet, compared to 87 parties to the London \nConvention covering 60%.286 Some important states such as the USA and Russia are party to the \nLondon Convention but not to the London Protocol.287  \nObjectives:  The objective of the Protocol is to protect and preserve the marine environment from all \nsources of pollution at sea288, particularly resulting from dumping or incineration at sea of wastes or \nother matter.289 \nTerritorial scope:  The Protocol covers dumping in all marine waters other than the internal waters290 of \nits parties, as well as the seabed and its subsoil, but does not include sub-seabed repositories accessed \nonly from land. It is open to all states. Indirectly, the Protocol affects non-parties, because it prohibits \nthe export of wastes for dumping or incineration.291 Also, the Meeting of Contracting Parties (MOP) \nmay offer advice and assistance to both, Contracting and non-Contracting Parties. The effect of the \nProtocol could thus extend beyond the jurisdiction of Parties. \n \n283 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972. \nLondon, 7 November 1996, 36 International Legal Materials  (1997), p. 7. \n284 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (adopted 29 December \n1972, entered into force 30 August 1975, 11 International Legal Materials (1972) 1358, for the status of ratification see \nfootnote 1 (87 states are currently Party of the 1972 Convention). \n285 Ibid, Art. 23. \n286 As of 21 April 2017, see Status of multilateral Conventions and instruments in respect of which the International Maritime \nOrganization or its Secretary-General performs depositary or other functions, www.imo.org.  \n287 IMO: \u201cParties to the London Convention and Protocol\u201d, available at \nhttp://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/LCLP/Documents/Parties%20to%20the%20London%20Convention%2\n0and%20Protocol%20March%202016.pdf.  \n288 London Protocol Article 1 (10): \u201cPollution\u201d means the introduction, directly or indirectly, by human activity, of wastes or \nother matter into the sea which results or is likely to result in such deleterious effects as harm to living resources and \nmarine ecosystems, hazards to human health, hindrance to marine activities, including fishing and other legitimate uses of \nthe sea, impairment of quality for use of sea water and reduction of amenities. \n289 See Ibid, Art. 2. \n290 Article 7 of the London Protocol addresses internal waters by requiring Parties to either apply the London Protocol or \nadopt other effective permitting and regulatory measures to control activities in internal waters that would qualify as \ndumping if conducted at sea.  \n291 Ibid, Article 6. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n83 Resources covered:  The Protocol covers dumping of \u201cwastes or other matter\u201d, including the dumping of \nredundant vessels, platforms and other structures, at sea. As it defines \u201cwastes or other matter\u201d as \nmaterial and substance of any kind, form or description all relevant materials are covered. Matter \nincidental to or derived from the normal operation of vessels is not covered. The Protocol allows the \ndumping of eight categories of wastes292, if a prior permit is issued by the relevant national authorities \n(Art. 4 in connection with Annex 1, so called \u201creverse list\u201d 293). These matters include inert, inorganic \nmaterial. In sum, the Protocol covers abiotic resources. \nSteps of the value chain covered:  The London Protocol focuses on waste disposal. However, the permit \nconditions for dumping in Annex 2 include the consideration of waste prevention and management. \nPermits must be refused if appropriate opportunities exist to re-use, recycle or treat the waste without \nundue risks to human health or the environment or disproportionate costs.294 \nType of steering mechanism: The London Protocol uses regulatory instruments (general prohibition of \ndumping and incineration at sea, permission for certain categories of wastes under specific \nconditions), information  tools such as reporting and information for other Contracting Parties, and \ncooperation mechanisms.  \nContent \nRelevant obligations for parties: The most relevant obligation is the requirement to generally prohibit \nthe dumping and incineration of wastes at sea, and to prohibit the export of wastes to other countries \nfor these purposes (Arts 4 to 6). Dumping is defined as: disposal, incineration, abandonment or \nstorage in the seabed or subsoil thereof. As an exception to the default rule, parties may allow \ndumping for the categories of waste and other matter listed in Annex 1, subject to a permit and \nconditions that are set out in Annex 2. By setting the prohibition as the default and the permissions as \nthe exception, the London Protocol reverses the regulatory technique of the London Convention, under \nwhich dumping is allowed unless prohibited by it.  \nIn addition, the Parties have to take effective measures, according to their scientific, technical, and \neconomic capabilities, to prevent, reduce and where practicable eliminate pollution caused by \ndumping. The London Protocol explicitly requires parties to apply a \u201cprecautionary approach\u201d to \nenvironmental protection from dumping of wastes or other matter. This is noteworthy not only \nbecause of the clear legal obligation, but also because it explicitly requires parties to take preventive \nmeasures.295 \nSome elements in the permit process direct parties and applicants towards prevention of waste in the \nfirst place and waste management. Parties have to pay, \u201c[p]articular attention [...] to opportunities to \navoid dumping in favour of environmentally preferable alternatives\u201d (Art. 4 (2). The permit conditions \nin Annex 2 contain a step by step procedure for the assessment of wastes in view of dumping \nalternatives and the potential effects of dumping. A permit may be issued only if all impact evaluations \nare completed and certain monitoring requirements determined. It has to be reviewed regularly, \ntaking into account the monitoring results. \n \n292 Dredged material; sewage sludge; fish waste or material resulting from industrial fish processing operations; vessels and \nplatforms or other man-made structure at sea; inert, inorganic material and organic material of natural origin; bulky items \nprimarily comprising iron, steel, concrete and similarly unharmful materials for which the concern is physical impact, and \nlimited to those circumstances where such wastes are generated at locations, such as small islands with isolated \ncommunities, having no practicable access to disposal options other than dumping; carbon dioxide streams from carbon \ndioxide capture processes for sequestration. \n293 IMO: \u201cConvention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter\u201d, available at \nhttp://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/LCLP/Pages/default.aspx.  \n294 Annex 2 para. 6 London Protocol. \n295 Article 3 (1) London Protocol. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n84 One step of the permit procedure is a \u201cwaste prevention audit\u201d as part of assessing alternatives to \ndumping. It includes an evaluation of certain waste reduction and prevention techniques.296 Moreover, \nconsideration has to be given to the following hierarchy of waste management options, which implies \nan order of increasing environmental impact: re-use; off-site recycling; destruction of hazardous \nconstituents; treatment to reduce or remove the hazardous constituents; and disposal on land, into air \nand in water. On an individual basis, the issuance or renewal of a permit can be linked to the \nimplementation of waste prevention strategies or depend on the absence of appropriate alternative \nwaste management opportunities, e.g. recycling. Thus, in order to prevent maritime pollution, the \nProtocol foresees mechanisms which have the potential to increase resource efficiency by preventing \nor recovering waste.  \nThe assessment of wastes considered for dumping also requires each party to develop a national \nAction List, providing a mechanism for screening and classifying candidate wastes and their \nconstituents. This mechanism is supposed to pay attention, in particular, to toxic, persistent and \nbioaccumulative substances (cadmium, mercury, lead, copper, zinc, petroleum hydrocarbons etc.) If a \ncertain upper level, as determined by the Action List, is reached, the waste must not be dumped. \nAccording to para 9 of Annex 2, the Action List \u201ccan also be used for further waste prevention \nconsiderations\u201d, and thus contribute to the efficient use of these resources. \nThe London Protocol also contains usual provisions on cooperation. Upon request and through \ncollaboration with the IMO, Parties shall support each other through advice on implementation of the \nProtocol and through information and assistance, relating inter alia  to environmentally sound \ntechnologies, disposal and treatment of waste, waste minimization, clean production processes and \ncorresponding know-how, or to other measures to prevent and reduce pollution caused by dumping \n(Art. 13). \nIn sum, by prohibiting the export and import of hazardous waste by default, and subjecting it to permit \nconditions for certain wastes, the London Protocol makes it more expensive to dispose of such wastes. \nThis creates an economic incentive to produce less waste and to recover more, which both leads to \nmore resource efficiency. This incentive is strengthened by the permit conditions which include \nmeasures to prevent waste generation and recovery. Thus, the main regulatory technique of the \nLondon Protocol is not a direct obligation to produce less waste and recover more but the creation of \neconomic incentives to do so.  \nThere have been three amendments to the London Protocol: The 2006 amendment added to Annex 1 \nthe storing of captured CO2 streams in sub-seabed formations. It entered into force in 2007. A follow-\nup amendment to article 6 in 2009 allows the export of CO2 streams for disposal under certain \nconditions. In 2013, amendments to the text and annexes included marine geoengineering in the \ngeneral prohibition and added a scientific assessment framework as a condition for permits. The 2009 \nand 2013 amendments are not in force as yet.297 \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : The Protocol has the usual institutional structure and establishes a Meeting of Contracting \nParties (MOP). The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is responsible for all Secretariat duties \nin relation to the Protocol. \nEvaluation and review: The MOP continually reviews the implementation of the Protocol and evaluates \nthe Protocol\u2019s effectiveness. To this end, it reviews reports of the Parties with the assistance of a \nsubsidiary body, the so called Compliance Group and the Scientific Group of the Protocol.  \n \n296 Product reformulation, clean production technologies, process modification, input substitution and one-site or closed-loop \nrecycling. \n297 Status of multilateral Conventions and instruments in respect of which the International Maritime Organization or its \nSecretary-General performs depositary or other functions, 21.04.2017, www.imo.org.  FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n85 Reporting: Parties are required to report on the administrative and legislative measures taken to \nimplement the provisions of the Protocol and their effectiveness on a regular basis. Moreover, the \nParties have to report recordings of the permits issued and (where practicable) of the dumping \nactually occurred, as well as information following from the monitoring of the sea, on an annual basis. \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: The Protocol itself does not \ncontain compliance mechanisms or procedures. Implementation and compliance is based on \nassistance and co-operation by the MOP. However, after its entry into force the MOP adopted a \ncompliance mechanism in 2007.298 The MOP retains the overall responsibility for compliance matters, \noffers advice and periodically reviews the effectiveness of the compliance procedures and \nmechanisms. In addition, a Compliance Group (CG) has been established.299 It reviews reports, \nassesses compliance issues referred to it and may provide advice and guidance to individual Parties. It \ncan also make recommendations to the MOP, for example on the facilitation of co-operation and \nassistance, or on the elaboration of compliance action plans. Neither the MOP nor the CG can take \nbinding measures.300 \nThe Protocol also contains a provision on dispute settlement, which suggests using either the \nprocedures listed in Art. 287 of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)301 or an \nArbitral Procedure as set forth in its Annex 3.  \nStakeholders and public involvement: The Protocol does not contain provisions relating to public \nparticipation or stakeholder involvement.  \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: A range of international treaties address \nmaritime pollution by dumping. The 1972 London Convention still applies to those parties that have \nnot (yet) ratified the Protocol, but will no longer be amended with regard to new issues.302 The \ndumping of items listed in the so called black list (Annex I) is prohibited, whilst the dumping of grey-\nlisted-materials (Annex II and III), is subject to a special permit.303 As mentioned above, the London \nProtocol reversed the regulatory technique of the Convention under which dumping is allowed unless \nprohibited. Since the entry into force of the London Protocol in 2006, the parties to the two treaties \nhave had joint meetings, which however created some problems.304 \nThe International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) covers pollution \nfrom operational or accidental causes.305 According to the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea \n(UNCLOS), states are required to adopt laws and regulations to prevent, reduce and control pollution \nof the marine environment by dumping, though they do not have to prohibit it.306 UNCLOS requires \n \n298 IMO: \u201cCompliance with the London Convention and Protocol\u201d available at \nhttp://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/LCLP/Compliance/Pages/default.aspx.  \n299 IMO: \u201cCompliance with the London Convention and Protocol\u201d available at \nhttp://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/LCLP/Compliance/Pages/default.aspx.  \n300 Compliance Procedures and Mechanisms pursuant to Art. 11 of the 1996 Protocol to the London Convention 1972, \navailable at \nhttp://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/LCLP/Compliance/Documents/Compliance%20Procedures.pdf.  \n301 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 10 December 1982, in force 16 November 1994, 21 International Legal \nMaterials  (1982), p. 1261.  \n302 According to a decision in 2005, see Hong and Lee (2015) at 49. \n303 IMO: \u201cConvention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter\u201d, available at \nhttp://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/LCLP/Pages/default.aspx.  \n304 See Hong and Lee (2015) at 49-50. \n305 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution by ships (MARPOL), 12 International Legal Materials  (1973), \n1319, as amended before its entry into force by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto, in force 2 October 1983. \n306 Birnie et al.

In sum, the London Protocol is quite strict but not a comprehensive \ncode for the regulation of dumping, and has to be read together with the provisions of other treaties \nand customary international law conferring jurisdiction related to dumping on coastal and flag \nstates.307 \nThe London Protocol however, is the only international treaty of global scope that prohibits all \ndumping unless explicitly permitted . It thereby significantly strengthens the reverse approach of the \n1972 Convention.308 The new approach under the London Protocol is a much stronger expression of \nthe precautionary principle than in most of the regional agreements concerning the pollution from \nland-based sources.309 In particular, the London Protocol not only explicitly requires the precautionary \napproach, but also sets an example of how to make it operational through specific procedural and \nscientific requirements. However, due to its smaller membership, it is debated whether the London \nProtocol has already replaced the 1972 Convention in setting the international minimum  standard for \nthe national regulation of pollution of the marine environment by dumping, as called by Art.210 (6) \nUNCLOS.310 According to IMO, both treaties provide these standards.311 Because of that and the \ndifferences between the London Convention and London Protocol in substance as well as practice312, it \nhas been argued that the former should be merged into the latter, as intended originally. 313 However, \nthe potential benefits do not seem to outweigh the legal and political uncertainty this would create, \nand there does not seem any political traction for this idea. \nPolitical weight of the instrument : The 1972 Convention and the London Protocol regulate dumping at \nsea on a global level.  Together they have achieved widespread, although not global, ratification as well \nas coverage of world shipping tonnage. In line with the system envisaged by UNCLOS, they set \ninternational minimum standards for all states for the regulation of pollution of the marine \nenvironment by dumping. Moreover, most of the existing regional arrangements for the control of \ndumping are fully consistent with the Protocol or closely based on the 1972 Convention or the \nProtocol.314  \nHowever, Russia, the US and several developing states have not yet ratified the Protocol. Nevertheless, \nthe US is actively participating in the MOP.315  \nThe practice under the London Protocol has shown that the instrument is capable of responding to \nnew developments. Parties adopted three amendments in a relatively short time since its entry into \nforce, regulating current issues such as CO2 sequestration and marine geoengineering. \nEffectiveness:  According to Birnie et al, \u201c[t]he 1972 Convention is generally regarded as one of the \nmore successful treaty of the 1970s\u201d.316 With the adoption of the Protocol, the Parties have developed \neven more stringent standards for dumping at sea.

Gaps remain based on the \nnumber of parties as well as the amount of shipping covered. High-sea enforcement by the flag state \nmay often be ineffective,319 although Article 10 (3) requires parties are to cooperate in this respect. \nEven before the Protocol, the efforts of contracting parties to the London Convention to find \nalternative methods to dumping at sea reduced this practice of waste disposal.320 The Protocol is thus \nconsidered effective and therefore creates effective incentives to improve resource efficiency. \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: \n\u25ba The regulation technique of the London Protocol, based on the dumping prohibition by \ndefault and the issuance of permits for certain wastes under certain conditions , provides \neconomic incentives for resource efficiency \n\u25ba The linking of permit issuance or renewal to waste reduction and prevention strategies and \nthe absence of appropriate alternative waste management opportunities such as recovery, \nfurthers resources efficiency \n\u25ba The mechanism of the national Action List, prohibiting waste dumping if a certain upper \nlevel is reached, is noteworthy as such, but may also be used for waste prevention and thus \npotentially furthers resource efficiency \n\u25ba The obligations of parties to exchange information and know-how on measures relating to \nwaste minimization and clean production processes also furthers resources efficiency \n\u25ba The 2013 amendment on marine geoengineering is noteworthy because it draws a legal \ndistinction between legitimate scientific research and other activities. This regulatory \ntechnique could be a reference for other areas where the line between research and \npotentially commercial activities is blurred.321 \n \n317 See also Birnie et al.

It divides the sea into different spatial zones (internal waters, territorial sea, continental \nshelf, exclusive economic zone, deep seabed, high seas) with different rights and duties of all states, \nincluding to abiotic marine resources. These resources are addressed at the first step of value chain \n(extraction). In areas under national jurisdiction or where states retain sovereign rights to exploit \nresources, there are neither requirements nor impediments for coastal states regarding resource \nefficiency.  FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n89 The deep seabed (the \u201cArea\u201d) and its resources are defined as \u201ccommon heritage of mankind\u201d and are \nnot subject to sovereign rights. The Implementing Agreement exclusively addresses the Area and is to \nbe applied together with UNCLOS\u2019 provisions as a single instrument. Exploration and exploitation of \nmineral resources in the Area are administered by an international institution, the International \nSeabed Authority that acts on behalf of mankind. Both the original UNCLOS regime as well as the \nmodified regime under the Implementing Agreement are clearly focused on exploiting mineral \nresource for the benefit of all. They thus rather impedes resource efficiency and conservation. This is \nhowever restricted in two ways: First, access to the resources and their extraction is strongly \nregulated and controlled by an independent institution. This creates significant transaction costs that \nreduce the speed of extraction and therefore the total amount of available mineral resources. This \nfactual effect creates an economic incentive to use these resources more efficiently. Secondly, \nextraction has to be resource efficient in the sense of producing little waste, and shall not harm the \nmarine environment.  \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)322 and the Agreement on \nthe Implementation of Part XI323 (Implementing Agreement) are two binding international treaties but \nform one single instrument (Art. 2 (1) of the Implementing Agreement). The UNCLOS is often referred \nto as the \u201cConstitution of the Seas\u201d324 due to its near-universal participation and wide coverage. \nAdditionally, a considerable amount of the provisions of the UNCLOS are considered to be customary \ninternational law.325 Notably, the UNCLOS, in principle, does not allow reservations.  \nDespite its title, the Implementing Agreement considerably amends Part XI of the UNCLOS326 and \nprevails in case of inconsistency between Part XI of the UNCLOS and the Agreement (Art. 2 (1) of the \nImplementing Agreement).  \nAny state acceding to the Implementing Agreement is automatically bound by the UNCLOS (Art. 4 (2) \nof the Implementing Agreement). Similarly, each state that accedes to the UNCLOS after the \nImplementing Agreement entered into force also accedes to the Implementing Agreement (Art. 4 (1) of \nthe Implementing Agreement). \nObjectives:  One objective of the UNCLOS is to settle issues arising from various human activities at sea \nby establishing a widely accepted instrument.327 Remarkably, the objectives of the UNCLOS explicitly \ninclude the \u201cequitable and efficient\u201d utilisation of the oceans\u2019 resources and the conservation of their \nliving resources.328 It also aims at applying and developing the principle of common heritage of \nmankind with regard to the area of the seabed (see below at territorial scope) beyond national \njurisdiction and its resources; this basically means that the exploration and exploitation of this area \nhas to be carried out for the benefit of mankind as whole.329 \nThe main objective of the Implementing Agreement was to facilitate universal participation in the \nUNCLOS330 by accommodating the interests of industrialised states that were hesitating to join \n \n322 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Montego Bay, 10 December 1982, in force since 16 November 1994, UN \nDoc.

The UNCLOS contains \nrules governing the world\u2019s oceans whereas the Implementing Agreement only applies to the \u201cArea\u201d, \nwhich is the \u201csea-bed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof\u201d beyond national jurisdiction (Art. 1 (1) \nUNCLOS). Even states that are not party to the UN can accede to the Convention (Art. 305 UNCLOS).334 \nResources covered:  The UNCLOS covers fossil fuels, minerals (especially the provisions governing the \ncontinental shelf), and any other abiotic resource that is transported via the sea. For the Area, Art. 133 \nUNCLOS provides the following definitions: \u201c(a) \u2018resources\u2019 means all solid, liquid or gaseous mineral \nresources in situ in the Area at or be-neath the sea-bed, including polymetallic nodules; (b) resources, \nwhen recovered from the Area, are referred to as \u2018minerals\u2019\u201d. \nManganese nodules occur in the deep seabed, i.e. beyond the outer continental shelf (max. of 350 nm, \nArt. 76 (5) UNCLOS). They are constituted of different metals: primarily manganese and iron but also \ncobalt, copper, nickel, and traces of platinum and tellurium.335 There also are cobalt crusts (cobalt, \nplatinum, and other metals) and sulphur-rich ores.336 These nodules and crusts are covered by Part XI \nof the UNCLOS and the Implementing Agreement. \nSteps of the value chain covered:  Part XI and the provisions on marine scientific research of the \nUNCLOS and the Implementing Agreement, as well as the general allocation of sovereign rights over \nresources, primarily affect mineral extraction. Other provisions of the UNCLOS, such as the freedom to \nlay pipelines and the freedom of navigation, impact transport and trade. Furthermore, the UNCLOS \ncontains provisions on dumping of waste (see for instance Art. 194 (3) of the UNCLOS), which are \ndeveloped further e.g. by the London Dumping Convention and Protocol. \nType of steering mechanism: The UNCLOS uses regulatory tools (the obligation to preserve and to \nprotect the environment; prohibition of dumping in another state\u2019s maritime zones etc.), information \ntools (obligation to inform other states about marine scientific research activities; promotion of the \nestablishment of national and regional marine scientific and technological centres, promotion of \ntransfer of marine technology), and reporting tools (obligation to publish reports to the competent \ninternational organisations in the environmental fields). The Implementing Agreement uses regulatory \ntools (a comprehensive licence regime for exploring/exploiting mineral resources in the Area) \ncombined with an institutional backbone.  \n \n331 Churchill & Lowe (1999) at 20. \n332 Churchill & Lowe (1999) at 238. \n333 Elferink (2013) at 7. \n334 United Nations (2012) at 3. \n335 World Ocean Review (2017): \u201cMarine Minerals\u201d, available at http://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-1/energy/marine-\nminerals/.  \n336 World Ocean Review (2017): \u201cMarine Minerals\u201d, available at http://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-1/energy/marine-\nminerals/2/.  FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n91 Content \nRelevant obligations for parties:  \nTerritorial sea, contiguous zone, EEZ:  In its territorial sea, contiguous zone, and exclusive economic \nzone, every coastal state has certain sovereign rights but is obliged to grant other states freedom of \ninnocent passage. This has an impact on the transportation of goods by ship. For instance, resource \nefficiency is increased when the availability of transportation by sea results in shorter ways and a \nreduction of the use of petrol - although reduced transportation costs might lead to more overall \ntransport. Similarly, coastal states have to respect the freedom to lay pipelines (Art. 58 (1), 79 (1), 112 \nof the UNCLOS), in areas other than the territorial sea (Art. 2(1) of the UNCLOS). \nIn addition to its full sovereignty in the territorial sea, the coastal state has sovereign rights over the \nresources in the continental shelf (Art. 77 of the UNCLOS) and the EEZ (exclusive economic zone) (Art. \n56 (1) (a) of the UNCLOS), including its mineral resources. As a result, other states are prohibited from \nexploring and exploiting resources in these zones, except when they have the permission of the coastal \nstate. When exercising their sovereign rights, the coastal states are obliged to do so without infringing \nother states\u2019 rights (for example, regarding navigation under Art. 78 (2) of the UNCLOS). Consequently, \nin these zones, the UNCLOS\u2019 influence on resource efficiency is limited, as specific rules on the \nconservation of resources address living resources only. Its main effect is to allocate the right to \nexploit the relevant resources to the coastal state, which avoids free exploitation by everyone.  \nThe Area:  No state has sovereign rights over resources in the Area, which for this purpose are defined \nas mineral resources and belong to mankind as a whole (Art. 137, 133 of the UNCLOS). All exploitation \nactivities have to be conducted for the benefit of mankind as a whole in accordance with the system \nestablished in Part XI of the UNCLOS and the Implementing Agreement (Art. 140 (1) of the UNCLOS). \nAccordingly, the purpose of this system is to exploit resources for the benefits of all. As a starting \npoint, it thus rather impedes resource efficiency or conservation. However, one of the general polices \nfor the Area, in Art. 150 (b) of the UNCLOS, requires an \u201cefficient conduct of activities in the Area\u201d. It \nreflects the preamble\u2019s objective of efficient (and equitable337) use of the oceans\u2019 resources, and is not \nmodified by the Implementing Agreement. Moreover, unnecessary waste has to be avoided \u201cin \naccordance with sound principles of conservation\u201d. Thus, the exploitation of mineral resources is \nrestricted to some extent by explicit requirements of resource efficiency and conservation. However, \nPart XI of the UNCLOS does not contain detailed provisions concerning resource efficiency. In contrast \nto the provisions in section 2 of Part VII, it does not include specific instruments on resource \nconservation, either.338 Part XI of the UNCLOS and the Implementing Agreement mainly address the \ndistribution of access to resources between states and the protection of land-based exporters of \nmineral resources.339  \nThe International Seabed Authority (ISA) is the body that organises and controls activities in the Area, \nparticularly with a view to administering its resources (Annex section 1.1 of the Implementing \nAgreement). It implements standards for activities in the Area, such as exploration.340 A party applying \nfor exploration has to present a Plan of Work, which \u201coptimises the recovery and extraction of the \n \n337 In international law, the concept of \u201cequity\u201c is used for various legal and political purposes, based on notions of \u201cfairness\u201c \nin the application of rules. It is often used to justify special rules of access such as those for land-locked states in Art. 69 \nUNCLOS. In particular in the development context, it is often used to differentiate between developed and developing \ncountries.  \n338 See Sanden (2012) at 38-39. \n339 Sanden (2012) at 38. \n340 Damian & Ginzky (2016) at 578. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n92 minerals\u201d.341 It also has to demonstrate that is has adequate technology, and has to pay an application \nfee for exploration that could discourage rash applicants. For cobalt crusts, for example, the \napplication fee is 500,000 dollars (Reg. 21.1 of the Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for \nCobalt-rich Ferromanganese Crusts in the Area342). Applicants are also required to submit areas \nsufficiently large for two mining operations. The second site is then reserved for subsequent \nexploration or exploitation by either a developing state or the Enterprise, the institution that is to \nconduct mining activities on behalf of ISA (\u201csite banking\u201d). The purpose is to provide other states with \na time-limited option to explore and exploit sites in the Area and benefit from the revenues.343 The ISA \nshall also adopt appropriate rules, regulations and procedures for \u201cthe protection and conservation of \nthe natural resources of the Area and the prevention of damage to the flora and fauna of the marine \nenvironment\u201d (Art. 145 (b) UNCLOS). While the distinction between natural resources and damage to \nflora and fauna points to a duty to protect and conserve the mineral resources themselves, the general \nintention of Art. 145 is to \u201censure effective protection for the marine environment from harmful effects \nwhich may arise from such activities.\u201d It is thus difficult to imagine that the very object of resource \nexploitation is addressed by this provision, safe for the obligation to avoid unnecessary waste \naccording to Art. 150 (b) UNCLOS.  \nThe recently published Draft Regulations include a provision on the \u201cAvoidance of unnecessary waste \nin respect of the Resources in the Area\u201d.344 It forbids inefficient mining practices or dissipation of \nresources and enables the Secretary-General to receive information to detect inefficient mining (Draft \nReg. 33 (2)). If inefficient mining occurs, the Authority can give the binding order to stop mining (Draft \nReg. 33 (5)) or to mine only at certain rates (Draft Reg. 33 (4)). \nThe provision on transfer of technology, as set out in the Implementing Agreement, mainly enables \ndeveloping countries to also exploit seabed resources and thus increase extraction. While in theory it \ncould also reduce inefficient extraction, this seems negligible because applicants have to demonstrate \nadequate technology anyway.  \nState responsibility:  According to Art. 139 of the UNCLOS, sponsoring states and international \norganisations bear legal responsibility to ensure that any national entity complies with Part XI of the \nUNCLOS. The rules differ from customary rules on state responsibility mainly in two respects: First, \nthere has to be damage: Responsibility depends on whether a breach of a direct obligation of the state \nor an obligation related to activities of a sponsored entity results in damage.345 According to the \nInternational Tribunal on the Law of Sea (ITLOS, see below), this is the case when the Area, its \nresources and marine environment are damaged.346 Secondly, the sponsoring states are also liable for \ndamage caused by sponsored (private) contractors.347 However, this latter liability is excluded by Art. \n139(2) if the state has taken all necessary and appropriate measures to secure effective compliance,348 \nwhich requires a \u201cdue diligence\u201d standard. In any event, liability requires a causal link between a \n \n341 Draft Regulation 8 (4) of the International Seabed Authority (2016): Developing a Regulatory Framework for Mineral \nExploitation in the Area, Jamaica, available at: \nhttps://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/EN/Regs/DraftExpl/Draft_ExplReg_SCT.pdf.  \n342 Decision of the Assembly of the International Seabed Authority relating to the Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration \nfor Cobalt-rich Ferromanganese Crusts in the Area, ISBA/18/A/11, 22 October 2012. \n343 See Annex III Art. 9 (4) of the UNCLOS, and Annex section 2 para 5 of the Implementing Agreement. \n344 Draft Regulations on Exploitation of Mineral Resources in the Area, Kingston, 8 August 2017,ISBA/23/\u00d6TC/CRP.3, \navailable at https://www.isa.org.jm/files/documents/EN/Regs/DraftExpl/ISBA23-LTC-CRP3-Rev.pdf. \n345 Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, Advisory Opinion, Responsibility and \nObligations of States Sponsoring Persons and Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area, 1 February 2011 at para. 177. \n346 Advisory Opinon at para. 179. \n347 Advisory Opinon at para. 184. \n348 Similarly, Annex III, Art. 4 (4) of the UNCLOS limits responsibility. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n93 state\u00b4s or international organisation\u00b4s failure to carry out its responsibilities under Part XI of the \nUNCLOS and the damage.  \nMarine scientific research (MSR):  Like other activities, MSR in the Area is subject to part XI of UNCLOS \n(Art. 256). In other zones, MSR requires the consent of the coastal state. The coastal state is bound to \ngive its consent unless, inter alia, MSR is directly linked to exploitation or exploration of natural \nresources. It has been argued that MSR is a precondition for the efficient exploitation of marine \nresources because it reveals sites in which mineral resources are available for exploitation, provides \ninformation on the probability of a high loss of material or resources due to a harsh environment, and \nbecause it helps to reduce adverse environmental effects that are likely to occur during mining \nactivities in the seabed.349 \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : The UNCLOS does not have the usual institutional structure of modern MEAs with \ninstitutionalised regular meetings of the parties and a permanent secretariat. However, the UN \nSecretary General convenes annual meetings of the parties under a general power in Art. 319 (2)(e) of \nthe UNCLOS. With regard to the Area, the Council of the International Seabed Authority controls \nimplementation of Part XI (Art. 162 (2) (a) of the UNCLOS). Moreover, the Convention establishes the \nInternational Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (Annex VI of the UNCLOS) for dispute settlement, and the \nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (Annex II of the UNCLOS) which decides on \napplications for the extension of the continental shelf beyond 200 nm.350 The Parties elect the \nmembers and decide on the budget of these two institutions. \nTo administer the Area (Part XI and the Implementing Agreement), UNCLOS established the \nInternational Seabed Authority (ISA). It has three principal organs (Assembly, Council, and \nSecretariat) and two subsidiary organs (the Legal and Technical Commission and the Finance \nCommission).351 It also establishes the Enterprise, the organ which is to conduct mining activities in \nthe Area for the ISA as its \u201cmining arm\u201d,352 as soon as commercial mining is feasible. The ISA is \nconsidered to be the \u201cinstitutional manifestation\u201d of the principle of the common heritage of \nmankind.353 Instead of following financial interests, the ISA acts on behalf of all mankind. Its \nindependency from state interests is supposed to ensure a rational exploration and exploitation that is \npotentially more efficient than exploration and exploitation led by state interests. Additionally, the ISA \nissued an evolving Mining Code that contains regulations regarding the prospecting and exploration of \npolymetallic nodules, sulphides, and cobalt-rich crusts.354  \nEvaluation and review: In the absence of specific provisions on institutions and review,355 the UN \nSecretary General reports to the annual Meeting of the Parties on the implementation of UNCLOS, \npursuant to a UN General Assembly decision.356  \nArt. 154 of the UNCLOS requires the Assembly to review the functioning of the regime of the Area \nevery five years.

A proposed amendment can also be adopted by written procedure if no party objects \nwithin 12 months. There is a special procedure for amendments regarding the Area, which require \napproval by the Council and the Assembly of the International Seabed Authority (Art. 314).

Disputes arising in relation to the Area can only be resolved by \nthe Seabed Disputes Chamber of the ITLS (Art. 186 et seq.)358.  \nStakeholder and public involvement: Not only states can apply for exploration licences. Research \ninstitutions and businesses can also apply for a licence on behalf of states. As described above, \nsponsoring states bear the responsibility to ensure that any national entity complies with Part XI of the \nUNCLOS.  \nPursuant to Art. 169 (1) of the UNCLOS, international organisations and NGOs can make arrangements \nwith the Secretary-General, which subsequently enable them to attend meetings of all bodies of the ISA \nas observers (Art. 169 (2) of the UNCLOS). Non-governmental organisations that active in the field of \nlaw of the sea can participate as observers at the Meetings of Parties (rule 18 of the Rules of Procedure \nfor Meetings of States Parties359). Due to these provisions, non-state actors can draw attention to \nresource efficiency.  \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: The UNCLOS was negotiated under the \numbrella of the UN, and thus, has a close relationship to other bodies of the UN, such as the General \nAssembly, which arranged the Third UNCTAD and decided upon the annual review of \nimplementation.360 It is also part of the UN Oceans & Law of the Sea,361 an inter-agency mechanism that \nfacilitates cooperation between the ISA and other UN organisations.362 \nWhile UNCLOS provides a detailed regime on some issues such as marine delineation, on other issues \nit provides a framework to be elaborated by other instruments. This is the case, for instance, regarding \nthe dumping of wastes, where the UNCLOS is the framework within which standards developed \nelsewhere may be prescribed and designed.363 Accordingly, together with the 1972 Convention on the \nPrevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and other Matters, the 1996 London Protocol \n \n357 Tanaka (2012) at 33. \n358 See ITLOS Chambers at https://www.itlos.org/the-tribunal/chambers/, and Jenisch (2013) at 846. \n359 Rules of Procedure for Meetings of States Parties of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UN Doc. \nSPLOS/2/Rev.4, 15th Meeting, New York, 16-24 June 2005. \n360 United Nations (2012) at 10. \n361 See http://www.un.org/depts/los/.  \n362 International Seabed Authority, UN-Oceans holds 16th Meeting in Kingston, Kingston, 10 April 2017. \n363 Churchill & Lowe (1999) at 69. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n95 sets the international minimum  standard for all states for the regulation of pollution of the marine \nenvironment by dumping, as called by Art.210 (6) of the 1982 UNCLOS.364 The 1995 UN Fish Stocks \nAgreement is another example. \nIf the UNCLOS and the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Law of the Sea collide, the UNCLOS prevails \n(Art. 311 (1) of the UNCLOS).  \nWith regard to trade issues, the ISA has to govern the Area in line with the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade (GATT). \nPolitical weight of the instrument: With its 168 parties in UNCLOS and 150 in the Implementing \nAgreement, a wide coverage of issues, and its dispute settlement system, the UNCLOS is highly \npolitically influential. Germany, China, the Russian Federation, and Canada are party to both treaties. \nIn 1998, after the Implementing Agreement entered into force, the European Union became party to \nthe UNCLOS, and therefore also consented to be bound by the Implementing Agreement. \nThe USA is neither party to the UNCLOS nor to the Implementing Agreement.365 However, several \narticles are considered to be customary international law,366 which applies to the USA unless it \npermanently objects to it. \nEffectiveness:  The UNCLOS covers the entirety of the world\u2019s oceans. Some of its provisions were \nalready or afterwards considered to be customary international law.367 This suggests a high degree of \neffectiveness. However, as the UNCLOS was negotiated over 30 years ago, it does not address new \ntopics.368 It also lacks detail in some areas. Consequently, the Convention is effective as general treaty \ncovering all of the oceans, but in order to increase effectiveness in some areas, additional treaties and \ninstruments are necessary.369 A positive example is the Mining Code by the ISA. With regard to mineral \nresources, the zoning approach allocates rights and prevents potential free exploitation (\u201cseaward \nrush\u201d370). On the other hand, the allocation means that resource efficiency up to the EEZ depends on \nthe coastal states.371 In the high seas there are no mineral resources, so that abiotic materials only play \na role as dumped waste which is mainly addressed by the London Dumping Convention and Protocol.  \nConcerning the Area, the administration of resources by Part XI of the Convention and the \nImplementing Agreement is highly effective. Although the ISA\u2019s own mining institution, the Enterprise, \ndoes not exist yet beyond its legal establishment, the administration by the ISA is successful. States, \nincluding Germany, currently apply for exploration licences at the ISA and are obliged to comply with \nthe regulations of the Mining Code concerning exploration. To improve compliance with these \nregulations, the ISA issues recommendations.372 Furthermore, the ISA may issue new regulations \nconcerning new topics, which increases the effectiveness of its administration activities. As a result, \nthe ISA can manage emerging issues, such as exploitation due to new technology, effectively. The \nrelatively strict regime governing the Area contributes to exploiting the mineral resources efficiently \nin the sense of avoiding unnecessary waste in the extraction process, as required by Art. 150 (b) of the \nUNCLOS. The reference in this provision to \u201csound principles of conservation\u201d is linked to this \nparticular aspect only and is not a general conservation obligation.  \n \n364 Birnie et al.

FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n96 In accordance with the principle of common benefit of mankind, Part XI of UNCLOS is not a \nconservation regime. Its purpose is not to preserve the resources, but to organise the generation and \ndistribution of revenue from their exploitation. It does not require to use the mineral resources \nefficiently. However, because the regime strictly regulates access to the resources, it creates significant \ntransaction costs that reduce the speed of extraction and therefore the total amount of available \nmineral resources. This factual effect creates an economic incentive to use these resources more \nefficiently. \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: \n\u25ba As the Mining Code evolves according to the prospected activities in the Area, parties have \nan ongoing opportunity to strengthen the respective regulations and recommendations \nissued by the ISA. One option could be to embed efficiency standards or the precautionary \nprinciple. As a current member of the Council, Germany could strive for such initiatives. \n\u25ba With regard to the Area, the UNCLOS and the Implementing Agreements include elements \nof good practice:  \n\u25ba The strict regulation of access to exploitation creates an economic incentive to use the \navailable resource efficiently \n\u25ba The control of access and exploitation by the independent ISA strengthens this incentive \n\u25ba Art. 150 (b) of the UNCLOS requires to avoid unnecessary waste in the extraction \n \n2.1.2.3 Minamata Convention \nTable 4:  Minamata Convention (adoption: 10 October 2013; in force 16 August 2017) \nKey aspects  Summary  \nForm and legal status Binding, in force \nObjectives Protecting human health and environment from mercury \n Parties 113, incl.

It provides a toolbox of regulatory techniques targeting mercury along the entire value \nchain from mining, over trade and manufacturing, to recycling and waste disposal. Indirectly, the \nConvention might also impact the use of other resources, such as gold and coal, but the extent is \ndifficult to estimate. The most important mercury emitters373 have supported and already ratified the \n \n373 China and the US have ratified, but not India.

FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n97 Convention, indicating that at least these important players will actually implement it. The \nConvention\u2019s approach to regulating trade in mercury means that even non-Parties will be affected. \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  The Minamata Convention374 is an international treaty that was adopted on 10 \nOctober 2013, after three years of negotiations.375 The Convention entered into force on 16 August \n2017. 113 countries and the EU have ratified it so far, including important players such as China and \nthe United States. 376 \nObjectives:  The objective of the Convention is \u201cto protect the human health and the environment from \nanthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds.\u201d (Article 1) The treaty \nthus does not aim to reduce the use of this resource due to scarcity considerations but due to \nenvironmental and health concerns. \nTerritorial scope:  The Convention is open to all states and regional economic integration organisations. \nOnce in force, it will bind all its parties and regulate mercury on their respective territories. Given that \nthe Convention also regulates trade in mercury with non-parties, its effects might reach even beyond: \nA party may only export mercury to another state, if the importing state \u2013 be it a party or not - adheres \nto the standards of the Minamata Convention, with respect to health and environmental protection \nand uses of mercury.377 Similarly, a party may only import mercury from a non-Party, if that state \ncertifies that the source is allowed under the Convention. The effect of the Convention could thus \nextend beyond the territory of Parties. \nResources covered:  The Minamata Convention targets emissions (into the air) and releases (into water \nand land) from mercury and mercury compounds. Burning of coal and artisanal and small-scale gold \nmining (ASGM) are the most important anthropogenic sources, but also production of metals, cement \nproduction and oil refining are sources. Mercury is also still used in a range of products such as \nbatteries, light bulbs or dental amalgam. 378 Indirectly , the Convention impacts gold mining (where \nmercury is used to separate gold from ore)379, and activities that cause mercury emissions, such as coal \npower, cement production and primary production of non-ferrous metals (e.g. lead; copper; zinc). It \ndoes, however, not touch the primary production of ferrous metals and oil and natural gas burning, \nwhich also cause mercury emissions.380 \nSteps of the value chain covered:  The Minamata Convention addresses each step of the lifecycle, from \nmercury mining, import and export, manufacturing that uses mercury or mercury compounds, to \nrecycling and waste disposal.381 \nType of steering mechanism: The Minamata Convention uses information tools  (reporting on mercury \nstocks, mercury emission inventories), planning tools (national action plan on ASGM, and on emissions \nand releases) and regulatory instruments, both production-related and product-related \n(export/import restrictions, mining phase-out, phase-out of mercury-added products and \nmanufacturing, use of BAT/BEP standards for sources of emissions/releases). \n \n374 Minamata Convention on Mercury.

FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n98 Content \nRelevant obligations for parties: The Convention regulates the entire lifecycle of mercury, and targets \nemissions/releases from both intentional uses and where they occur as an unintentional by-product. \nHowever, many provisions only establish soft obligations or provide for exemptions. Most relevant for \nreducing the use of mercury  are the restrictions on mining, on mercury-added products, and \nmanufacturing processes using mercury. New mercury mining is completely banned and already \nexisting mining activities will be prohibited 15 years after entry into force of the Convention at the \nlatest. The Convention also obliges Parties to phase-out manufacturing, import and export of mercury-\nadded products listed in Annex A (e.g. batteries with mercury content by 2020), and to phase-out \nmanufacturing using mercury or mercury compounds, listed in Annex B (e.g. chlor-alkali production). \nHowever, Parties can make use of exemptions for limited time periods. Less restrictive obligations \napply to ASGM activities: Parties are only required to \u201ctake steps to reduce, and where feasible \neliminate\u201d the use of mercury or mercury compounds in this sector, and to develop national action \nplans. The obligations on mining, products and manufacturing processes could potentially significantly \nreduce the use of mercury, although Parties can register exemptions to the different obligations. \nIn a more  indirect manner, the Convention\u2019s obligations on the control of trade, emissions, releases, \nwaste and contaminated sites may further reduce the global use of mercury. Export and import of \nmercury is only allowed with written consent and if the importing country \u2013 being a Party or not \u2013 \ncomplies with the Convention\u2019s obligations on storage and waste disposal. Parties are further \nrequested to control \u201cand where feasible, reduce\u201d emissions (e.g. from coal power plants) and releases. \nFor this purpose, they shall establish inventories, require the use of best available techniques (BAT) \nand best environmental practices (BEP) for new emission sources, and take measures to reduce \nemissions from existing sources.382 The COP will develop and regularly update guidance on BAT and \nBEP. \nMercury waste and contaminated sites are to be managed in accordance with guidance still to be \nadopted by the Conference of Parties.  \nThese obligations, although not directly targeting the amount of mercury used, make it more difficult \nand potentially costly for Parties \u2013 and companies \u2013 to supply themselves with mercury, and to dispose \nof mercury waste. This could make the use of mercury less attractive. \nNext to reducing the use of mercury, the Convention might also indirectly reduce the use of other \nresources, first and foremost gold and coal . The Convention\u2019s obligations on ASGM aim at reducing the \nuse of gold mining techniques that use mercury \u2013 currently accounting for around 12-15% of global \ngold production.383 The alternatives to mercury-based techniques are mostly not affordable to \nartisanal miners so that steps to eliminate the techniques might overall result in reduced gold mining. \nHowever, the Convention\u2019s obligations are quite soft in this respect, and banning mercury-based \ntechniques does not seem socially viable. The impact on the amount of extracted gold can thus \nexpected to be minor. \nThe obligations on emission control could indirectly affect the use of coal, which is the largest source \nof anthropogenic mercury emissions. The Convention does not ban the use of coal but requires the use \nof BAT/BEP standards in new coal power plants, and measures to reduce emissions from existing \nplants. Technologies are already available for capturing 95% of mercury emissions at coal power \nplants, but are usually more costly. 384 This might result in higher electricity production costs as \ncompared to other energy sources and could thus reduce overall the use of coal. However, such \neconomic considerations will not only depend on the stringency of the BAP/BET guidance but also on \n \n382 Eriksen and Perrez (2014), at 205. \n383 Artisanal Gold Council (2015), at 4.  \n384 Selin (2014), at 12. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n99 many other factors lying outside the scope of the Convention. It is thus difficult to predict the \nConvention\u2019s impact on the use of gold or coal. \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : The Minamata Convention has the usual institutional structure and follows the approach \nof modern MEAs and establishes a Conference of the Parties (COP) that is to review and evaluate the \ntreaty\u2019s implementation.  \nEvaluation and review: The Convention can be considered a \u201cliving treaty\u201d: the COP is obliged to \nregularly review Annexes A and B, guidance on best available techniques and best environmental \npractices. The COP also regularly evaluates the overall effectiveness of the Convention, starting six \nyears after its entry into force. For this purpose, the COP is set to establish a system to collect \ncomparable monitoring data on mercury and mercury compounds.  \nReporting: Parties are required to report on the implementation of the Convention. The reports have to \ninclude information on stocks of mercury and mercury compounds, on the phase-out of mining and \nimplementation of trade restrictions, on manufacturing facilities using mercury or mercury \ncompounds, and on whether ASGM is occurring on its territory. The reports also need to provide \ninventories of emissions and releases. The procedures for reporting, and specifically for the \nestablishment of inventories are still to be decided. The COP is set to review the reports, and to use \nthem as basis for the effectiveness evaluation. In addition to these reports, Parties may also develop \nimplementation plans, but this is not obligation. \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: An implementation and \ncompliance committee promotes implementation of, and compliance with all obligations under the \nConvention, covering both individual and systemic issues. It may make recommendations to the COP \nbut cannot take measures directly itself. The Convention also contains a provision on dispute \nsettlement, suggesting using either the ICJ or an arbitration or conciliation procedure, set out in detail \nin the Annex E. \nStakeholder and public involvement: The Minamata Convention sets emphasis on making publicly \navailable information on mercury, its health and environmental impacts, and alternatives. The treaty \nalso provides for the engagement of stakeholders. If Parties have notified ASGM activities, they are \nrequired to prepare national action plans that include strategies for the involvement of stakeholders. \nParties are also set to collaborate with NGOs and vulnerable population in providing education, \ntraining and public awareness on mercury. Finally, the COP will provide guidance on managing \ncontaminated sites, which \u201cmay include methods and guidance for...engaging the public\u201d.  \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: A range of international treaties regulate \nhazardous substances, including mercury. The 1998 Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed \nConsent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade385 promotes \ncooperation in trade of certain chemicals, including mercury compounds, by facilitating information \nexchange. The 1998 Heavy Metals Protocol, placed under the 1979 Convention on Long-Range \nTransboundary Air Pollution386 regulates mercury air emissions from industrial sources, combustion \n \n385 Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in \nInternational Trade, 10 September 1998, in force 24 February 2004, 38 International Legal Materials  (1999), 1. \n386 Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Heavy Metals, 24 June 1998, in force 29 \nDecember 2003, 2237 United Nations Treaties Series (2005), 4.

These treaties all address certain aspects of the lifecycle of different \nhazardous substances. This had resulted in somewhat of a piecemeal network of regulation of \nmercury. The Minamata Convention in turn takes a lifecycle approach. The consequence is that in \nsome aspects the Minamata Convention duplicates existing international regulation, e.g. on waste, \nchlor-alkali production and stationary sources of mercury air emissions.387 On other aspects, it \nstrengthens or complements existing law. Parties to the hazardous substances treaties (Basel, \nRotterdam, Stockholm) recognised the partial overlaps between these and initiated a Synergies \nprocess in 2008 to better coordinate the work of the COPs. In 2013, they signalled interest in also \ncooperating with the Minamata COP.388 The Convention itself refers in its article on waste to the Basel \nConvention and obliges the COP to cooperate closely with the latter.  \nPolitical weight of the instrument: The Minamata Convention fills a critical gap in the piecemeal \nregulation provided by other MEAs in providing a lifecycle approach to mercury. Support by the US, a \nmajor political player at the international level, for addressing the mercury problem was major \npolitical trigger for negotiations. 389 However, phase-out deadlines are long, many exemptions are \navailable, and not all relevant industrial processes and mercury containing products are covered.390 \nParticularly for the most challenging sources, namely ASGM and point sources of emissions (e.g. coal \npower), the Convention does not provide numerical targets but only soft action-oriented \nobligations.391 \u201cTaken together, treaty obligations, even if properly implemented in all major countries, \nmay at best only limit future projected increases in mercury emissions and releases rather than \nbringing them down from current levels.\u201d392  \nEffectiveness:  There is little data since the Convention has only recently in force.  \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: \n\u25ba At COP1, Parties will work on the guidance on, amongst others, reporting, effectiveness \nevaluation and compliance. \n\u25ba Parties can propose additional mercury-added products for listing in Annex A and \nmanufacturing processes in Annex B \n\u25ba The COP will assess trade in mercury compounds (no date), listing in Annex A (5 years \nafter EIF), listing in Annex B (5 years after EIF) \n\u25ba The COP will establish guidance for BAT/BEP on mercury emissions, on interim storage of \nmercury. \n\u25ba Parties are invited to exchange information on BAT/BEP, alternatives etc. \n \n387 Bassett (2016), at 25 f.  \n388 Omnibus decision on enhancing cooperation and coordination among the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions: \nAdopted by the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention as decision BC.Ex-2/1, by the Conference of the Parties to \nthe Rotterdam Convention as decision RC.Ex-2/1 and by the Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm Convention as \ndecision SC.Ex-2/1. \n389 Selin (2014), at 1. \n390 Selin (2014), at 16.  \n391 Bassett (2016), at 70. \n392 Selin (2014), at 16.

However, the Protocol has no direct \nimpact on the use of abiotic resources. \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer393 is an \ninternational treaty that was adopted on 16 September 1987 as a protocol to the Vienna Convention \nfor the Protection of the Ozone Layer. The Montreal Protocol entered into force on 1 January 1989. It \nenjoys universal support with 196 countries and the European Union being parties.394 \nObjectives:  The objective of the Protocol is to protect the ozone layer by controlling and eliminating \nozone-depleting substances (ODS), \u201ctaking into account technical and economic considerations and \nbearing in mind the developmental needs of developing countries\u201d (preamble).  \nTerritorial scope:  The Protocol is open to all states and regional economic integration organisations. It \nbinds all its parties on their respective territories. Given that the Protocol also regulates trade in ODS \nwith non-parties, its effects reach beyond: Parties are obliged to ban the import of ODS from, and the \nexport to, non-Parties, unless that non-Party demonstrates that it is in compliance with the provisions \nof the Protocol.395 These trade restrictions have been an effective tool for incentivising states to adhere \nto the Protocol\u2019s standards or to ratify the Protocol.396 \nResources covered:  The Montreal Protocol does not have a direct impact on the use of abiotic \nresources. ODS are used in a range of industries that extract or process abiotic resources (e.g. in mines \n \n393 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, Montreal, 16 September 1987, in force 1 January 1989, \n1552 UNTS 3. \n394 See UNTC, Status of Treaties, at https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVII-2-\na&chapter=27&clang=_en.  \n395 UNEP Ozone Secretariat (2016a). \n396 Sands (2003) at 352.

However, since many alternatives to ODS are \navailable, it is not likely that the Protocol impacts the amount of abiotic resources used. \nSteps of the value chain covered:  ODS are used along the entire value chain of abiotic resources. The \nProtocol thus covers each step. \nType of steering mechanism: The Montreal Protocol uses information tools  (reporting on ODS \nconsumption, production and trade), and regulatory instruments (export/import restrictions, phase-\nout of ODS consumption and production). \nContent \nRelevant obligations for parties: The Protocol establishes obligations on parties to limit, reduce or \nphase-out the consumption and production of different ODS. It provides specific timetables for \ngradually phasing out first the consumption and later on the production of relevant substances. The \nphase-out dates range between 1993 and 2020. The list of substances controlled under the Protocol \nhave been expanded and the timetables adjusted several times to reflect new scientific and \ntechnological developments.  \nDeveloping countries consuming less than annually 0.3kg of controlled substances per capita were \ngranted a grace period of 10 years beyond the regular phase-out dates. They are also entitled to \nreceive support under the Protocol\u2019s financial mechanism.  \nIn specific cases, production and consumption of certain ODS is exempt from the phase-out \nrequirements. Such exemptions are agreed by the MOP, for specific countries or uses, only on a \ntemporary basis.397 Reasons can include health, safety or that the use is critical for the functioning of \nsociety, and if there are no technically and economically feasible alternatives.398  \nParties are prohibited from importing controlled substances from non-parties or exporting to non-\nparties. Furthermore, parties are required to \u201cdiscourage the export to any State not party to this \nProtocol of technology for producing and for utilizing controlled substances\u201c (Article 4.5). To \nimplement these provisions, parties have to establish a licensing system for the import and export of \nODS. \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : Convention/protocol model, The Montreal Protocol establishes a Meeting of the Parties \n(MOP) that meets annually to review and evaluate the treaty\u2019s implementation. An Open-ended \nWorking Group meets in the time between MOP meetings and prepares decisions for consideration by \nthe MOP. An amendment of the Protocol in 1990 established a Multilateral Fund that provides \nfinancial and technical assistance to developing countries. Developed countries are required to \ncontribute to the Fund according to the UN scale of assessments. The creation of the Fund was key for \nbringing developing countries into the Protocol.399 \nEvaluation and review: The Protocol is a \u201cliving treaty\u201d: the MOP reviews the control measures every \nfour years, assisted by three assessment panels providing advice on scientific, environmental, and \ntechnological and economic developments. Based on these findings, the MOP has successively \nstrengthened the regime by including additional substances and tightening timetables.400 Such \nadjustment decisions may be taken by two-thirds overall majority if efforts to reach consensus have \n \n397 UNEP Ozone Secretariat (2016b). \n398 Decision IV/25, Essential Uses, UN Doc.

The procedure \ncan be triggered by the party concerned, another party or the Secretariat \u2013 which in practice is the \nmain channel.402 On the basis of implementation reports by the Secretariat, the Committee may seek \nadditional information and recommend measures to the MOP, such as providing assistance, issuing \ncautions or suspending rights under the Protocol, e.g. restricting trade with the non-complying \nparty.403 The Committee exchanges information with the Multilateral Fund, and in some instances has \nalso recommended to the MOP to cut funding to countries that consistently failed to provide baseline \ndata.404 The MOP has taken a large number of decisions regarding non-compliance over the years, \nmostly with respect to economies in transition or developing countries.  \nStakeholder and public involvement: A special feature of the Protocol\u2019s regime is the Technology and \nEconomic Assessment Panel that provides advice on alternative technologies, as a basis for MOP \ndecisions. The Panel is assisted by various committees that evaluate technical options for specific ODS \nsectors. Many members of these committees come from ODS industries or regulators that know the \npractical concerns of the relevant industries on the ground but that also have direct influence and \ncredibility to promote implementation.405 For example, a committee member from British Petroleum \nwas able to introduce ODS substitutes for fire fighting first in its own company and then convinced \nother oil and gas companies to follow, irrespective of endorsement by the MOP.406The involvement of \nstakeholders might thus have positive repercussions even beyond what is formally agreed by parties.  \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: The Montreal Protocol touches on many issues \ncovered by other international agreements, the most prominent being climate change. Since ODS are \nvery potent greenhouse gases, their gradual reduction is supporting the objectives of the UNFCCC and \nthe Paris Agreement. In fact, the Montreal Protocol has been said to have avoided greenhouse gas \nemissions by 5-6 times as much as the Kyoto Protocol.407 However, as a substitute for ODS, F-gases \u2013 \nmainly HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons) - were introduced which are greenhouse gases with a very high \nglobal warming potential. The increasing use of HFCs might outweigh the climate benefits of the \nMontreal Protocol. While HFCs are reported under the UNFCCC, the Montreal Protocol seemed to be \nthe more appropriate forum due to the direct link of HFC increase and ODS phase-out. In response, in \nOctober 2016, the parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted an amendment (Kigali Amendment408) \nincluding HFCs in the list of substances controlled under the Protocol. The amendment specifies that it \nis not intended to exempt HFCs from the mitigation obligations under the UNFCCC or the Kyoto \n \n401 Parson (1998) at 127. \n402 Brack (2003) at 217. \n403 Decision IV/5, as amended by Decision X/10, Review of the Non-Compliance Procedure, UN Doc.

The ban on trade with non-parties was said \nto discriminate between products stemming from parties and non-parties and thus to violate the \nGATT\u2019s most favoured nation rule. However, the states negotiating the Montreal protocol concluded \nthat the provisions would be covered by the exception under Article XX (b) GATT regarding \nenvironmental protection.411 To date, no country has brought a dispute before the WTO concerning the \nMontreal Protocol. \nPolitical weight of the instrument: During the negotiations of the Montreal Protocol many observers \nwere doubtful that countries would be able to agree on regulating ODS, given the scientific uncertainty \nback then and the complexity of the issue (ODS were used in thousands of different products).412 The \nstrong support by the United States, which had already passed domestic ozone regulations, and the \nefforts of the United Nations Environmental Programme certainly helped to build the necessary \nconsensus.413 The Montreal Protocol entered into force already two years after adoption and achieved \nuniversal participation as the first multilateral environmental agreement in history in 2009.  The mix of \nflexibilities granted to developing countries, financial and technical assistance together with the trade \nrestrictions have secured the high number of ratifications414 and established it as a role model.  \nEffectiveness:  The Montreal Protocol is often named as the most successful MEA. While the original \nversion of the Protocol was predicted to not stop the increase of ODS levels, the possibility to \nstrengthen measures with a two-thirds majority allowed to reduce ODS levels over time.415 The value \n \n409 \u201cThis Amendment is not intended to have the effect of excepting hydrofluorocarbons from the scope of the commitments \ncontained in Articles 4 and 12 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or in Articles 2, 5, 7 and 10 \nof its Kyoto Protocol.\u201c Decision XXVIII/1, Further Amendment of the Montreal Protocol, UN Doc.

This is about 40% \nof the decrease needed to return to 1980 benchmark levels.416 There is plenty of evidence that the \nintroduction of international regulation jump-started the search for ODS substitutes in industry, \nmaking such substitutes available in remarkably short time after the adoption of the Protocol.417 The \nclose involvement of industry and regulators in the assessment of technical options and \nimplementation review supported this development.418 However, the success of the Protocol has \npartly been undermined by a vibrant black market in ODS that surged in the 1990s, mainly as a result \nof the differing phase-out schedules among developed and developing countries.419 \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: \n\u25ba The adjustment procedure provides an innovative model for adapting an MEA to changing \npolitical, technological and economic realities.  \n\u25ba The focus on technological alternatives and the involvement of industries, via the \nTechnology and Economic Assessment Panel has helped to promote acceptance of ODS \nphase out.  \n\u25ba The flexibilities granted to developing countries has helped to build consensus around ODS \nphase out.  \n\u25ba The inclusion of trade restrictions has convinced non-parties to join the agreement.  \n\u25ba But despite its role model character, the MP\u2019s success has not been repeated so far \u2013 this \nneeds to be considered when addressing resource efficiency.  \n \n2.1.2.5 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants \nTable 6:  Stockholm Convention (adoption: 22 May 2001, entry into force: 17 May 2004) \nKey aspects  Summary  \nForm and legal status binding, in force \nObjectives Protect human health and the environment from persistent organic \npollutants \nParties 181 Parties (as of 21 June 2017), incl Germany \nTerritorial scope Global \nResources covered depends on whether link to POPs \nStage of the value chain  All stages \nSteering tool information, regulation, planning \nPolitical weight ++ \nRelevance for RE ++ \nSummary \nThe Stockholm Convention regulates the production, use, releases and trade in persistent organic \npollutants (POPs).

Relevant \nindustries might, however, decide to turn to alternative production methods that release less POPs, \nwithout reducing production levels. \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants420 is an \ninternational treaty that was adopted on 22 May 2001. The Convention entered into force shortly after \non 17 May 2004 when the minimum threshold of 50 ratifications was met. Today it has 181 parties.421 \nThe parties include all European Union member states; the United States have signed but not ratified \nit.  \nObjectives:  The objective of the Convention is to protect human health and the environment from \npersistent organic pollutants (POPs). \nTerritorial scope:  The Convention is open to all states and regional economic integration \norganisationsand binds all its parties on their respective territories. The Convention also regulates \ntrade in POPs with non-parties, its factual effects go further: A party may only export POPs to another \nstate, if the importing state \u2013 be it a party or not - adheres to the standards of the Convention with \nrespect to waste management or DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) use. The Stockholm \nConvention seeks to steer the conduct of non-parties by providing a disincentive for not adhering to its \nstandards.  \nResources covered:  POPs are produced for agricultural and industrial purposes, or are produced \nunintentionally through a broad range of industrial processes. While the largest source of \nunintentional releases in Africa, Latin America and the Pacific is open burning, in other regions the \nmetal industry and power generation are significant sources.422 For example, POPs occur in iron ore \nsintering, coke production, iron and steel production, copper, aluminium, lead, zing, brass, bronze, \nmagnesium production.423 Also the recycling of metal can emit POPs. \nSteps of the value chain covered:  The Stockholm Convention covers the entire life cycle of the \ncontrolled POPs, restricting not only their production and use but also addressing unintentional \nreleases, trade in POPs, and waste management.424 \nType of steering mechanism: The Stockholm Convention uses information tools  (reporting on \nproduction, import and export of POPs and on the implementation of the Convention), planning tools \n(national action plan on unintentional releases, implementation plans on the obligations) and \nregulatory instruments (elimination of substances, restriction of use and production, export/import \nrestrictions, use of BAT/BEP standards for unintentional releases). \nContent \nRelevant obligations for parties: The Convention requires parties to eliminate the production and use of \nsubstances listed in Annex A (currently 24 substances), and to restrict the production and use of those \n \n420 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, Stockholm, 22 May 2001, in force 17 May 2004, 2256 UNTS 119. \n421 As of 21 June 2017, see UNTC, Status of Treaties, available at \nhttps://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&mtdsg_no=XXVII-15&chapter=27&clang=_en.  \n422 UNEP (2017), at 91.  \n423 Toolkit for Identification and Quantification of Releases of Dioxins, Furans, and Other Unintentional POPs under Article 5 \nof the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, Source Group 2 Ferrous and Non-Ferrous Metal Production, \navailable at http://toolkit.pops.int/Publish/Main/II_021_Metals.html?panel=5#SpryAccordion1.  \n424 Dupuy and Vi\u00f1uales (2015), at 211. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n107 listed in Annex B (two substances).425 To reflect the different circumstances of countries, parties may \nregister specific exemptions for each of the substances with the Secretariat but such exemptions only \napply for a limited time period (usually 5 years, which the the COP may extend). \nParties are further obliged to also take measures to reduce unintentional releases of POPs listed in \nAnnex C (seven substances). To this end, parties have to develop and implement action plans, promote \nthe use of substitutes, best available techniques and best environmental practices. \nThe Convention requires parties to implement strategies for identifying stockpiles, products and \narticles containing POPs, and to manage these in a safe, efficient and environmentally sound manner. \nRecovery, recycling, reclamation, direct reuse or alternative uses of POPs are not allowed. \nExport of listed POPs is only allowed for the purpose of environmentally sound disposal, or to a party \nthat is allowed to use the respective POP. Export to a non-party is only permitted if the respective state \ncertifies that it complies with the Convention\u2019s obligations on management of POPs stockpiles or DDT \ncontrols. \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : The Stockholm Convention has the usual institutional structure and follows the approach \nof modern MEAs: it establishes a Conference of the Parties (COP) that is to review and evaluate the \ntreaty\u2019s implementation. The COP has not found agreement yet on the establishment of a compliance \ncommittee foreseen in the Convention. The GEF serves as the financial mechanism of the Convention. \nReporting: Parties have to report every two years on the quantities of production, import and export of \nsubstances listed in Annex A and B, and also on the implementation measures it has taken and their \neffectiveness. While most parties have submitted their initial plans, only around 20% have also \nprovided the required updates.426 \nEvaluation and review: The Convention is designed as a \u201cliving treaty\u201d: the COP may add or amend the \nannexes by majority vote, and parties are bound by these amendments unless they opt out within one \nyear. A POP review committee, involving chemical experts, examines the proposals from parties on \nlisting additional chemicals in the annexes, as a basis for such COP decisions.427 The committee is \ncurrently reviewing four additional chemicals, one of which is also used in metal working.428 The COP \nhas already twice amended Annex A and added six additional substances. \nThe Convention also requests the COP to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the Convention. The \nfirst such review was conducted in 2009, where it was decided that the reviews should take place \nevery six years. In 2015, an effectiveness evaluation committee was established429, which presented its \nfirst report in January 2017.430 \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: The Convention requires the COP \nto establish a non-compliance procedure but parties were not yet able to agree. The issue will be on \nthe agenda again at COP9 in 2019. \nStakeholder and public involvement: The Convention requires parties to promote public awareness and \npublic participation in addressing POPs.

The stakeholders involved include \nenvironmental non-governmental organizations, industry and private sector associations, funding \nagencies and mechanisms and other donors, researchers, universities and related initiatives, workers' \nunions and national local authorities.431 \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies:  The Stockholm Convention, Basel Convention \nand Rotterdam Convention established a so-called Synergies process in 2008/09 to enhance \ncoordination across the Conventions. At joint sessions they address, for instance, common issues such \nas illegal trade and traffic in hazardous chemicals and wastes. A 2016 workshop showed that there is \nstill room for improvement in the coordination between stakeholders and ministries at national level \nin implementing the three conventions.432 \nEmissions of a number of POPs released from certain industrial facilities are also estimated and \nreported under the UNECE Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers. \nPolitical weight of the instrument: The Stockholm Convention enjoys almost universal participation but \nthe United States as an important player are not party. \nEffectiveness: The Stockholm Convention aims at controlling or even eliminating hazardous POPs. The \nEffectiveness Evaluation Committee of the Stockholm Convention presented its first report in 2016 \nwhich found \u201cevidence that the entry into force of an amendment for a particular chemical is a trigger \nfor some but not all Parties to amend and implement administrative or legal measures to control the \nproduction, use, import and export of the chemical.\u201c According to the report, POPs listed in 2004, \nconcentrations in air and in human populations have declined and continue to decline or remain at low \nlevels. In other words, the Convention does change the conduct of its parties, and these changes do \nhave an effect towards the Convention\u2019s objective. However, for the newly listed POPs, concentrations \nare only beginning to show decreases, and are in a few instances, increasing and/or stable. The \nCommittee also highlighted that there is a significant gap of data on the implementation, also due to \nthe lack of a compliance mechanism. 433 \nGiven that POPs also occur in the production of metals, the implementation of the Convention could \nindirectly reduce the levels of metal production \u2013 unless producers turn to alternative production \nmethods emitting less POPs.  There is, however, no information available on whether the Convention \nreduces these production levels. \nThe trade restrictions affecting non-parties may additionally increase the Convention\u2019s effectiveness \nbecause (1) they provide an increased incentive for parties to not use POPs and (2) provide a \ndisincentive for non-parties to ignore standards. \nThe Convention could also partly be regarded as an obstacle to resource efficiency: the recycling of \nsome metals releases dioxine, which is a POP controlled under the Convention.  \n \n431Synergies among the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, Joint-Clearing-house Mechanism Communities and \nPartners, available at \nhttp://www.brsmeas.org/Implementation/KnowledgeManagementandOutreach/Clearinghousemechanism/Communities/\ntabid/5532/language/en-US/Default.aspx.  \n432UNEP (2016a). \n433 UNEP (2017).

The timeline for COP9 could be favourable. \n\u25ba The COP still needs to agree on the establishment of the compliance mechanism. \n\u25ba The review committee is a successful mechanism through which the Convention\u2019s scope \nhas been broadened several times already.  \n\u25ba The trade restrictions are a mechanism to impact the use of POPs even beyond parties. \n\u25ba There is a lack of research on links between POPs and resource use. \n \n2.1.2.6 Paris Agreement \nTable 7:  Paris Agreement (adoption: 12 December 2015; in force: 4 November 2016) \nKey aspects  Summary  \nForm and legal status Binding, in force \nObjectives Keep global temperature rise well below 2\u00b0C, striving for 1.5\u00b0C; adapt to \nclimate change, redirect finance flows \nParties 149 (as of 22 June 2017), incl.

Although its obligations are general \nand not resource-specific, reducing GHG emissions necessitates extracting less fossil resources, \nbecause the combustion of fossil fuels is the main source of GHG emissions. Although they are not \nspecifically addressed, the Paris Agreement also covers GHG emissions occurring during the \nextraction, processing and transport of abiotic resources. Many of the provisions of the Agreement lack \nprecision and prescriptiveness and do not create clear legal obligations for parties. The almost \nuniversal ratification in a very short time indicates broad political support and likely implementation \nincluding by major emitters, although there are uncertainties about the US. \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  The Paris Agreement434 is a treaty that was adopted on 12 December 2015 \nunder the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)435. The Agreement \nentered into force on 4 November 2016.

This \ndecision also provides details on how to implement as well as mandates and work programmes for \ndesigning and agreeing further guidelines, standards and procedures for implementation. The US have \nannounced their intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but this would in any event not take \neffect before November 2020. (Art. 28). \nObjectives:  The objective of the Agreement is to keep the increase in global temperature well below \n2\u00b0C, or even 1.5\u00b0C, to increase the ability to adapt, and to make finance flows consistent with low-\ncarbon development. The Agreement also aims to bring GHG emissions down to net-zero in the second \nhalf of the 21st century (Art (4.1)). \nTerritorial scope:  The Agreement is open to all parties of the UNFCCC. The Agreement binds all its \nparties and is almost global. \nResources covered:  The Paris Agreement does not mention specific resources, but it targets \nanthropogenic GHG emissions and thus indirectly impacts resource consumption in various ways: (1) \nThe objective of net-zero GHG emissions can only be met if the use of coal, oil and gas is reduced to \nnear zero in the coming decades, which also means that the extraction of these resources would need \nto be significantly reduced; (2) Extraction, processing and transport of most other resources require \nhigh levels of energy, which is traditionally fossil-based and thus GHG-intensive. Reducing global GHG \nemissions as required by the Paris Agreement means that the extractive industries have to become \nmore energy-efficient and in the long run either switch to cleaner energy sources or reduce their \nactivities; (3) Certain resource extraction processes cause fugitive GHG emissions, e.g. in the case of \ncoal mining, or gold and copper mining when mines are located close to methane containing \ndeposits.437 The Paris Agreement could thus also impact these extraction processes.  \nSteps of the value chain covered:  The Paris Agreement covers all anthropogenic GHG emissions \nwithout differentiating between the sources of emissions. It therefore does not address specific steps \nof the value chain but rather all steps that cause GHG emissions. However, the implied necessity to \nsignificantly decrease fossil extraction directly impacts this step of the value chain. \nType of steering mechanism: The Paris Agreement uses what many call a \u201cbottom-up\u201d structure: it is \nbased on mere national planning (nationally determined contributions, national adaptation plans, \n2050 climate strategies) and international transparency obligations (reporting on climate policies, \nGHG emission inventories), and relies on peer pressure and public pressure to safeguard ambition. \nHowever, the objective to redirect financial flows in Art. 2.1(c) is gaining increasing attention and \ncould be a highly important steering tool, depending on how parties will implement it in the coming \nyears.  \nContent \nRelevant obligations for parties: The Paris Agreement was a huge diplomatic effort and the quest for \nconsensus among all UNFCCC parties on a binding instrument came at the expense of detail and \nprecision in its individual provisions. Many of the obligations use \u201cshould\u201d instead of \u201cshall\u201d, are \nphrased vaguely, or are qualified by expressions like \u201cas appropriate\u201d. This means that not all \nprovisions in the Paris Agreement are equally prescriptive or precise.438 \nThe Paris Agreement does not oblige parties directly to reduce the use of certain resources or to use \nthem more efficiently. However, based on current scientific knowledge, the objective and the \n \n436 As of 28 June 2017, see http://unfccc.int/2860.php. It has 195 signatories. \n437 Jain, Cui and Domen (2016).  \n438 Bodle et al. (2016) at 17; for detailed analysis see Bodle and Oberth\u00fcr (2017). FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n111 obligations to reduce GHG emissions and redirect finance flows imply that parties need to reduce or \neven phase-out the use of certain resources, first and foremost coal and oil (see above). \nThe Paris Agreement establishes the collective goal for parties to peak GHG emissions as soon as \npossible and to reduce GHG emissions to net-zero by the second half of the century. Parties are \nrequired to prepare and present individual climate plans (nationally-determined contributions, NDCs) \nevery five years that set out how the party intends to contribute to the collective objectives. Parties are \nnot obliged to implement or achieve these plans exactly as submitted but they have to take measures \nwith the aim of achieving these NDCs. The Paris Agreement explicitly envisages that parties the NDCs \nreflect each party\u2019s \u201chighest possible ambition\u201d and that each NDCs is a \u201cprogression\u201d beyond previous \nefforts. Developed countries \u201cshould\u201d include economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets. \nBeyond these parameters, there are no more specific rules as to the content or ambition level of the \nNDCs. The Agreement thus leaves a lot of leeway to countries on the approach they take to reducing \nGHG emissions and on which sectors to focus. At COP24 in 2018 parties adopted more detailed rules \nregarding modalities, procedures and rules for implementation. The rules on content of and \naccounting for NDCs as well as the core reporting rules do not directly address RE.439 The NDCs \npresented so far vary widely with respect to specificity (some only mention relevant policy fields, \nothers set quantitative targets) and coverage, and many are conditional on the provision of financial \nsupport.440 Emission projections based on the sum of all NDCs submitted show that countries are not \nyet on track to keep temperature increase well below 2\u00b0C or even 1.5\u00b0C. Parties are also invited to \nprepare long-term low-GHG emission strategies. There are no rules (yet) for their content either and \nsome of the already presented strategies only summarise existing research without setting specific \ntargets or defining policy pathways. Mexico\u2019s long-term strategy, in contrast, sets the objective to \nreduce fugitive methane emissions from mining operations.441 \nWhile the NDCs mostly do not provide clear emission reduction pathways or targets, in the long-term \nGHG emissions in all sectors need to be phased-out if parties want to achieve the objectives of the Paris \nAgreement. This implies a phase-out of the use of oil, coal (unless e.g. carbon capture and storage \nbecomes available at significantly scales) and gas in combustion processes.  \nSince the mining sector is currently still highly dependent on fossil fuel-based energy, the Paris \nAgreement could indirectly also impact the extraction and thus availability of other resources. \nHowever, the mining sector is already increasingly switching to renewable energy sources.442 The \nParis Agreement also covers fugitive methane emissions of e.g. gold mines and could thus impact the \nextraction of this resource. However, there are technologies available to capture this methane and use \nit for electricity production.443 It is thus not clear to what extent the Paris Agreement will have an \nimpact on the use of resources other than coal, oil and gas. \nThe Agreement also explicitly aims at making finance flows consistent with low-GHG and climate \nresilient development but it does not specifically require parties to e.g. revise their subsidy policies or \nto introduce carbon pricing. Time will tell whether parties will develop further guidelines for \nimplementation of this overarching purpose and how they will address it.  \n \n439 Decision 4/CMA.1, FCCC/PA/CMA/2018/3/Add.1, and 18/CMA.1, FCCC/PA/CMA/2018/3/Add. 2.

It establishes a Conference of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA) and other \npermanent bodies that guide, review and evaluate the treaty\u2019s implementation.  \nReporting : The Paris Agreement establishes a transparency framework under which Parties have to \nregularly report on their GHG emissions in \"inventories\u201d and on their progress in implementing their \nNDCs. The inventory reports have to follow the IPCC guidelines which require reporting on emissions \nfrom mining.444 \nEvaluation and review: Similar to other recent MEAs, the Paris Agreement could be labelled a \nframework or \u201cliving treaty\u201d as it mainly provides a direction and an outline of what parties are to do, \nwhile further details and work programmes are laid down in the COP-decision that accompanied the \nadoption of the Agreement. Many issues were left for COP/CMA decisions to allow for future \ndevelopment without needing to undergo a treaty amendment procedure. Accordingly, additional \nguidance on many issues still needs to be adopted by the CMA. A global stocktake takes place every \nfives years in order to assess collective implementation and guide the subsequent NDCs.  \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: An implementation and \ncompliance committee is envisaged to promote implementation of, and compliance with all obligations \nunder the Agreement. Most details on the modalities and procedures of the committee still need to be \ndetermined by the CMA. \nStakeholder and public involvement: The Paris Agreement recognises the importance of public \nparticipation and engagement of different actors in addressing climate change. The Agreement itself \ndoes not establish specific mechanisms in this respect but the accompanying COP decision has \nestablished various fora to cooperate with sub-national government levels, the private sector and civil \nsociety, e.g. on specific mitigation opportunities. Here too, time will tell whether this new approach \nwill complement the political momentum and push governments towards ambitious implementation.  \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: The Paris Agreement has been adopted under \nthe UNFCCC, which is a framework convention with few specific obligations. The Paris Agreement is \nnot meant to replace the UNFCCC but rather to specify it and bring it up to date. Since all economic \nsectors cause GHG emissions, addressing climate change is a broad undertaking that touches on many \npolicy fields. There are thus many potential overlaps, conflicts and synergies with other international \ntreaties not specifically targeting climate change, ranging from the international trade regime and \ninvestment law to the CBD or treaties on specific sectors like international shipping.  \nPolitical weight of the instrument: 195 UNFCCC parties have signed the Paris Agreement. It entered \ninto force in record time and has so far achieved 150 ratifications. The Agreement also enjoys very \nhigh levels of political support: governments of all levels do not only frequently refer to the instrument \nbut many also show commitment to implement their NDCs. During and in the aftermath of the Paris \nsummit, many initiatives were launched to support the implementation of the Agreement. The US \nannouncement of their intention to withdraw has so far not had a knock-on effect on other parties.  \nEffectiveness: The Paris Agreement only recently entered into force and the first round of NDCs cover \nperiods starting from 2020. There are thus no data available yet on the effectiveness of the instrument. \n \n444 See categories 1A 2 i and 1 B 1 in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, as refined 2019, vol. \n1.8.

Its main objective is not \nresource efficiency but market co-ordination and stability. The CFC\u2019s mandate includes all abiotic \nresources that qualify as tradable commodities. Today its regulatory approach is mainly financing \ncommodity development projects, focused on the commodity instead of particular countries. These \ninclude projects that promote resource efficiency, and their impact on resource efficiency depends on \nthe individual projects. The CFC currently appears to move away from addressing abiotic resources.  \n \n445 Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities.

FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n114 Overview \nForm and legal status:  The Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities is an \ninternational treaty that establishes the CFC as an international organisation. It entered into force on \n19 June 1989.446 Currently, the CFC has 101 Member States and 9 institutional members.447  \nObjectives:  According to the Agreement, the CFC should achieve the goals set out in the Integrated \nProgramme of Commodities set out in UNCTAD Resolution 93 (IV).448 The resolution was intended to \nimplement the \u201cNew International Economic Order\u201d by improving the position of the then newly \nindependent states in comparison to developed states.449 The CFC\u2019s objectives include stable \nconditions in commodity trade, to improve market structures in the field of raw materials, to \ncoordinate International Commodity Agreements and to generally improve the economic situation of \ncommodity producing developing states.450 Resource efficiency is no direct objective of the CFC. \nMore specific objectives are set out in 5-year-action plans. In 2003-2007, the concept of sustainable \ndevelopment was a guiding principle for this period.451 During the next period, the CFC intended to set \nits goal to support developing states in moving up the value chain in their own state.452 The Action \nPlan 2008-2012 included the cost-effectiveness of commodity production.453 Projects funded by the \nCFC aim at, inter alia , increasing production and productivity and the promotion of innovation.454 \nTerritorial scope:  The Agreement Establishing the Common Funds of Commodities accepts UN member \nstates, any of the UN\u2019s specialised agencies, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Additionally, \ninternational organisations that are active in fields of action of the CFC are eligible for membership. \nNon-member states might be affected by the CFC\u2019s commodity market coordination measures, or if the \nCFC\u2019s projects are designed in a manner that has extraterritorial effects.  \nResources covered:  The term \u201ccommodities\u201d is not defined in the Agreement. Projects financed by the \nCFC show that it covers biotic and abiotic resources, including metals such as copper, nickel, lead, \nzinc.455 However, the CFC shows a strong tendency towards biotic resources, such as coffee, cocoa and \ntropical timber.456 Depending on the impacts of its market intervention instruments and the projects \nfinanced by it, substitute resources may be covered indirectly. If market interventions decrease or \nincrease the price for a commodity, the demand for another commodity might be affected as well. \nAnother aspect is the potential effect of projects: The promotion of copper use might result in a \ndecrease in use of other metals that are used for the same products instead of copper. There are \nprojects with direct relevance for resource efficiency, such as project \u201cZinc die-casting in India\u201d457 aims \nat improving efficiency of the zinc die-casting sector.  \n \n446 Common Funds for Commodities (2016). \n447Common Fund for Commodities, \u201cCFC Member States\u201d, http://common-fund.org/about-us/members-states/.  \n448 Resolution 93 (IV) Integrated Programme for Commodities.

By supporting the transfer of \ntechnology on manufacturing, such as in the project on Transfer of Technology for High Pressure \nCopper Die Casting in India,461 or the promotion of copper use,462 the CFC covers other steps in the \nvalue chain, such as manufacturing and trade. \nBuffer stocking operations of the CFC mainly target production, trade, and consumption of \ncommodities. \nType of steering mechanism: The CFC is a financial institution and fulfils its functions with two main \ninstruments (\u201caccounts\u201d). The First Account is for market interventions through financing \ninternational buffer stocks and internationally coordinated national stocks. It is designed to support \nprice control actions by associated International Commodity Agreements. The organisations \nestablished by International Commodity Agreements enter into agreements with the CFC in order to \nreceive financial support by the CFC for their actions.  \nThe Second Account finances other measures related to commodities, defined as \u201ccommodity \ndevelopment measures\u201d with the aim to improve structural conditions in markets and competitiveness \nof specific commodities (Art. 18(C)(3)(a)). These measures include but are not limited to research, \nassistance by the CFC in the form of joint financing or technical assistance, and productivity \nimprovements. International Commodity Bodies, for instance, can sponsor projects that are to be \nfinanced by the CFC. Financial assistance from the Second Account includes grants and loans.  \nBesides, the CFC requires from associated International Commodity Organisations reports on market \ndevelopments of their respective commodity, which is an information tool.  \nContent \nRelevant obligations for parties: The direct obligations for parties under the Agreement relate to the \nestablishment and operation of the CFC. Apart from institutional provisions, the key obligations are \nfinancial and enable the CFC to fulfil its mandate: Members have to finance the Fund (art.10 and art. \n11), and associated International Commodity Organisations and their Members also have financial \nobligations to the CFC (art. 14). Furthermore, ICOs are prohibited from borrowing from other \ninstitutions to finance buffer stocking operations and are asked to inform the Fund about the resource \nmarket they are concerned with. Hence, the Fund aims at avoiding market interferences by other \ninstitutions that might jeopardize the Fund\u2019s and associated ICO\u2019s own interventions and activities.  \nAlthough the obligations under the Agreement do not directly affect resource efficiency, the Fund\u2019s \nactions have the potential to indirectly affect it. For instance, a controlled, high price can result in more \nefficient use of the commodity in manufacturing processes in order to avoid higher production costs. \n \n458 Common Funds for Commodities (2016). \n459 Common Fund for Commodities, \u201cSenegal Used Lead Acid Battery (ULAB) Collection and Recycling Project\u201d, available at: \nhttp://common-fund.org/newprojects/project-overview/project-details/news/senegal-used-lead-acid-battery-ulab-\ncollection-and-recycling-\nproject/?tx_news_pi1[controller]=News&tx_news_pi1[action]=detail&cHash=5a9e9ec454ecbabfa8acf0d5c247581e.  \n460 International Lead Association (2014). \n461 Common Fund for Commodities, \u201cTransfer of Technology for High Pressure Copper Die Castaing in India\u201d, available at: \nhttp://common-fund.org/newprojects/project-overview/project-details/news/transfer-of-technology-for-high-pressure-\ncopper-die-casting-in-india-cfcicsg05-\n1/?tx_news_pi1[controller]=News&tx_news_pi1[action]=detail&cHash=ed99c4a31def3ffb492cb195340a6435.  \n462 Common Fund for Commodities, \u201cPromotion of Copper Use\u201d, Project ICSG/01, available at: http://common-\nfund.org/newprojects/project-overview/project-details/news/promotion-of-copper-\nuse/?tx_news_pi1[controller]=News&tx_news_pi1[action]=detail&cHash=b7d898a07327d7743f155a2ac8933a2d.  \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n116 Accordingly, the CFC\u2019s mandate to stabilise commodity markets and prices can have an indirect effect \non resources.  \nThe financial obligations also fund the projects under the second account. In this respect, the eligibility \nrequirements for receiving the CFC\u2019s support for a project are also relevant. They are outlined in the \nFive-Year Action Plans. Selection criteria for projects from the 2015 Guidelines for the Operations of \nthe CFC for the Period 2013 to 2015463 that potentially impacted resource efficiency were  innovation, \npotential to growth and environmental as well as social sustainability. \nFurthermore, the recipients of resources and facilities of the Fund are obliged to use them exclusively \nto achieve the objectives of the Fund and to fulfil its functions (art. 16).  \nInstitutions, reviews, decision-making \nInstitutions : The Agreement establishes the bodies that operate the Fund, in particular a Governing \nCouncil, an Executive Board, a Managing Director and a Consultative Committee. \nThe Governing Council has \u201call the power of the Fund\u201d (art. 20(1)) and consists of one governor and \none alternate per Member. Each Member has one vote. Although decisions are to be adopted by \nconsensus wherever possible, in principle a simple majority suffices.  \nThe Executive Board consists of 28 Executive Directors and their alternates, which are appointed by \nthe Governing Council. Its main responsibilities are the operations of the Fund and it reports to the \nGoverning Council. The decision-taking process is similar to the Governing Council. \nA Managing Director is appointed by the Governing Council by a qualified majority vote. She or he \ncannot hold another office in the CFC and conducts the ordinary business of the CFC. \nThe Consultative Committee is to provide advice to the Executive Board on matters related to the \nSecond Account, such as technical and economic aspects of programmes proposed by International \nCommodity Bodies. \nEvaluation and review : The Agreement can be amended (Art. 51 of the Agreement), but it does not \ncontain a provision allowing for regular evaluation or review.  \nReporting: The CFC is obliged to provide annual reports, including an audited statement of accounts to \nits Members. This information is also to be forwarded to the UN General Assembly, the Trade and \nDevelopment Board of UNCTAD, to Associated ICOs, and other interested international organisations. \nOnly associated International Commodity Organisations have to report to the Fund on market \ndevelopments regarding their commodity (Art. 17 (9) (e) of the Agreement). \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: In case that a Member fails to \nfulfil its financial obligations, the Governing Council may suspend its membership by qualified \nmajority. A suspended Member may lose its membership entirely after one year.  \nQuestions regarding the interpretation or the application of the Agreement are addressed first by the \nExecutive Board and potentially then by the Governing Council. If the Governing Council cannot reach \nsuch a decision, it shall submit the questions to an arbitral tribunal.  \nStakeholder and public involvement : The Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities \ninvolves other international commodity organisations and bodies through their voluntary association. \nOther stakeholders and the public can be involved through projects supported by the CFC through its \nSecond Account.  \n \n463 Common Fund for Commodities (2015a).  FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n117 Assessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: The Agreement is part of implementing the \nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development agenda.464 It also supports close cooperation of \nthe Fund with other International Commodity Organisations. The First Account of the CFC is reserved \nfor International Commodity Organisations providing international buffer stocks or internationally \ncoordinated national stocks. ICOs have to enter into an Association Agreement with the CFC in order to \nbenefit (art. 7.1of the CFC Agreement). Associated ICOs include the International Copper Study Group, \nthe International Lead and Zinc Study Group, and the International Nickel Study Group. The CFC and \nthe ICOs hold annual meetings on which they discuss matters of cooperation and joint actions, \nwhereby the ICOs provide expert knowledge.465 The CFC functions as a coordinator of commodity \nagreements, bodies, and organisations.  \nPolitical weight of the instrument: Instead of focusing on a specific commodity, the CFC takes a holistic \napproach: It covers all commodities and all steps of the value chain. It coordinates international \ncommodity bodies and their establishing agreements. It is the first instrument that takes this \napproach. With 101 member states and 9 IOs participating, it has a large membership and the \npotential to influence commodity-related politics. Members include China, Russia, Mexico and the EU; \nbut not Australia, Canada and the USA. This limits the political weight of the instruments, as these \nstates have an important role in international commodities trade. It also appears that the CFC is \nshifting its focus away from market interventions to project financing.466 This would indicate that its \npolitical weight is limited.  \nEffectiveness: The initial approach of the CFC to use its market intervention and coordination \ninstruments proved to be unsuccessful. Project financing, on the other hand, became the CFC\u2019s main \ncourse of action and was adapted in 2013.467 The fact that project financing was adapted and continues \nafter over 30 years of existence of the CFC shows that CFC members regard it as effective. Regarding \nresource efficiency, the CFC\u2019s effectiveness depends on the content of the individual project and \npotentially on their aggregate effects. The inclusion of sustainability in its guiding principles468 could \nbe a hook for addressing resource efficiency. However, the CFC\u2019s impact on abiotic resources is \nconsiderably small, as recent projects mostly cover biotic resources.469  \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: \n\u25ba Small political opportunity to address resource efficiency in general or at large scale. \n\u25ba However, projects concerning recycling and transfer of techniques can support the efficient \nuse of resources and prevent waste. \n\u25ba Buffer Stocks could have more impact but offer no political buy-in. \n \n464 Common Fund for Commodities, \u201cOrganisational Profile\u201d, http://common-fund.org/about-us/organisation-and-profile/. \n465 Common Fund for Commodities, \u201cInternational Commodity Bodies\u201d, http://common-fund.org/about-us/partners/icbs/.  \n466 Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Energie (2017) at 3. \n467 Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Energie (2017) at 3. \n468 Ibid. \n469 Common Fund for Commodities (2015) at 37ff.

Each group focuses on specific metals: lead and zinc, nickel, and \ncopper. Their mandate is to influence decision-makers by generating and providing information on \nmetal-related issues, focusing on market developments and the metal economy worldwide. This can \nindirectly influence resource efficiency. There also are projects in each group that are directly linked to \nresource efficiency. The groups\u2019 political weight is based on the significant share of world trade they \nrepresent and their special expertise. It is difficult to assess to what extent the work of the metal study \ngroups promotes or impedes resource efficiency.  \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  Each metal study group is an intergovernmental organisation established by a \ntreaty: The Terms of Reference for the International Lead and Zinc Study Group470 (ToRLZ) entered \ninto force on 5 June 1959; the Terms of Reference for the International Nickel Study Group471 (ToRN) \non 23 May 1990 and the Terms of Reference of the International Copper Study Group472 (ToRC) on 23 \nJanuary 1992.  \nObjectives:  According to their Terms of Reference, the main objective of the three international study \ngroups is to enhance international cooperation on lead-, zinc-, nickel-, and copper-related issues by \ngathering information and establishing intergovernmental consultations and information exchange.473 \nTo this end, the groups collect data and provide studies.474 The focus lies on the respective metal \n \n470 Terms of Reference of the International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG) \u2013 Rules of Procedure of the Group.

Resource efficiency can implicitly be part of the objective, if it has an impact on \ntrade or the market. Conversely, the studies can affect resource efficiency by influencing the respective \nmarket. Producers, manufacturers, and traders will have an interest to make most out of the resources \navailable to them as soon as they have an (economic) incentive to do so.  \nTerritorial scope:  The groups cover their respective metals worldwide. All states and \nintergovernmental organisations with responsibilities as regards to commodity agreements that are \ninterested in the consumption, production, and trade of a respective metal can join the Lead and Zinc, \nNickel or Copper Study Group. Only the Terms of Reference of the Lead and Zinc Study Group require \nmembership at the UN, an appropriate specialised agency or the GATT. The work of the study groups \nhas potential impact on non-member states, and can thus have effects beyond the territories of \nMembers. \nResources covered:  The International Study Groups respectively target lead and zinc, copper, and \nnickel. Furthermore, the Groups also publish studies on by-products of nickel, copper, zinc and lead. \nThese include several other metals (bismuth, germanium, cobalt and others) and rare earth \nelements.475 Indirectly, the activities of the Study Groups can have an impact on substitute metals, for \nexample by triggering price or supply changes that have an impact on the demand for substitute \nmetals. \nSteps of the value chain covered:  The International Study Groups concern all steps of the value chain. \nTheir Terms of Reference emphasise trade and the metal economy (see, for example, Art. 4(a) and (c), \nArt. 16ff. of the ToRC). Specific aspects are addressed, for instance by the International Copper Study \nGroup\u2019s annual Recyclables Survey that focuses on refined production and copper alloy scrap,476 \ncovering the steps of production and recycling or waste reduction. \nThe terms of reference for the Lead and Zinc and Nickel Study Groups emphasise that they affect all \nforms of lead and zinc and nickel, including scraps, wastes, and/or residues (Art. 5 of the ToRLZ, Art. \n3(b) and 4(a) of the ToRN). For instance, the study groups work together on recycling matters.477 \nType of steering mechanism: The International Study Groups use information tools . These include \ncollection and distribution of statistics and information, annual assessment reports of the world \ncopper and nickel situation, discussions on market development, ad hoc studies on the zinc and lead, \ncopper, and nickel economy, and the consultation and exchange of information on world production, \nstocks, trade and consumption. For instance, the three study groups publish monthly statistical \nbulletins with an overview of the current situation in the world markets of lead, zinc, nickel, and \ncopper.478  \nContent \nRelevant obligations for parties: The Terms of Reference of all three study groups oblige their Members \nto contribute to their budget. This ensures a financial basis for studies or projects conducted by the \ngroup, which may include studies or projects on resource efficiency.  \nFurthermore, the International Study Nickel and Copper Groups require their Members to \u201cuse their \nbest endeavours to cooperate the attainment of the objective of the Group, in particular by providing \n \n475 Smale, Don, \u201cImportance of Latin America\u2019s Contribution to the Global Supply of Copper, Lead, Zinc and Nickel and their \nBy-product Metals\u201d, presentation held at the EU-Latin America Dialogue on Raw Materials, Lima, 10-11 March 2014, at 31. \n476 International Copper Study Group, \u201cEnvironmental and Economic Activities\u201d, \nhttp://www.icsg.org/index.php/environment-economics/environmental-and-economic-activities.  \n477 International Nickel Study Group, \u201cEnvironmental and Economic Activities\u201d, available at: \nhttp://www.insg.org/economic14.aspx.  \n478 White (2012) at 17.

This is relevant if and to \nthe extent that the groups address resource efficiency and need relevant data. \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions:  The groups have small and functional institutional setup. The International Copper and \nNickel Study Groups have a General Session, which is vested with the highest authority, a Standing \nCommittee, and the Secretariat. The International Lead and Zinc Study Group has a Chairman (and two \nvice-chairmen) instead of a General Session. All groups may establish other Committees as \nappropriate. \nThe terms of reference do not mention the legal personality of the Lead and Zinc Study Group. \nHowever, the Terms of Reference of the International Nickel Study Group establish a legal personality \nof the group in its host country. It cannot enter trade contracts. Similarly, the International Copper \nStudy Group has legal personality, which is limited by the prohibition to enter into trade or transaction \ncontracts or other financial obligations.  \nEvaluation and review: The terms and references of all study groups can only be amended by \nconsensus.479 They do not provide for periodical review and evaluation of the ToR. However, there is \nan annual review of the budgetary obligations of the group members. Only the Zinc and Lead Study \nGroup exceptionally allows a vote for budgetary decisions. \nReporting: Since there almost no material obligations on members (besides making their financial \ncontributions and providing data), there are no reporting obligations regarding implementation.  \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: The Terms of Reference of the \nInternational Lead and Zinc Study Group state that a Member that did not pay its annual contribution \nhas to give an explanation before the Standing Committee (Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of the \nInternational Lead and Zinc Study Group). The Terms of Reference for the International Copper and \nNickel Study Groups do not provide for any provisions on compliance procedures, remedies, and \ndispute settlement procedures. \nStakeholder and public involvement: All Study Groups used the provision allowing for further \ncommittees to establish an  Industry Advisory Panel  that includes industry representatives of \nMembers and observers in the annual meetings of the groups. Thereby, the Groups acquire the expert \nknowledge of industry representatives. In return, industry representatives have the chance to \ncomment on the work of the groups.480 Their involvement will have a primary focus on economic \nrelated topics but might indirectly also impact resource efficiency. \nThe International Lead and Zinc Study Group allows non-governmental observers in its meetings (Rule \n7 of the Rules of Procedure).481 \nPublications of the Study Groups are available to the public, but mostly for sale on their website.  \n \n479 Since the ToR are treaties involving financial obligations for its parties, amendments would probably require domestic \napproval by its parties.  \n480 For the Lead and Zinc Study Group, see International Lead and Zinc Study Group, \u201cIndustry\u2019s Role\u201d, available at \nhttp://www.ilzsg.org/static/industryrole.aspx?from=5.  \n481 International Lead and Zinc Study Group, \u201cPermanent Observer Organisations\u201d, available at \nhttp://www.ilzsg.org/static/observers.aspx?from=3.  \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n121 Assessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: All of the Study Groups are partners to the \nCommon Fund for Commodities as International Commodity Bodies,482 i.e. conduct projects under the \nSecond Account of the CFC.483 Accordingly, the Study Groups can bring their expert knowledge to the \nCFC\u2019s projects.  \nThe Terms of Reference for the International Lead and Zinc Study Group make a direct reference to the \nUN and the GATT (Art. 1 of the ToRLZ). Similarly, the ToRC and ToRN include a provision that \nspecifically allows for arrangements with the UN and its entities. UNCTAD is an observer in the Groups \nfor Lead and Zinc and in the group for nickel.484 \nThe Study Groups are considered to be sister organisations.485 They work closely together, for example \nin their cooperation in recycling and by- and co-products, and are now even co-located in Lisbon.486 \nPolitical weight of the instrument: The membership of the Study Groups mirrors their political weight: \nApart from the Nickel Study Group, in which China is not a member, almost all major producing \ncountries, such as China, Russia, Australia and the USA, participate in the study groups. Additionally, \nover 85% of the lead and zinc producing and consuming states are part of the ILZSG.487 The Copper \nStudy Group encompasses 76 % of the copper producing states and 81 % of the copper consuming \ncountries.488 Only the Nickel Study Group falls short of this result. It only comprises 40% of the nickel \nextraction and 22 % of the nickel consumption.489 All groups have a unique pool of information on the \nrespective metals and their by-products. This expertise can also secure political influence of the Study \nGroups.  \nSince the main purpose and instrument of the groups is to collect and provide information, there are \nvirtually no material obligations (besides making financial contributions and providing data). The \nStudy Groups rely on the continuing interest of their members to participate in their work. \nEffectiveness: The fact that the ILZSG has existed for almost sixty years shows that its members find it \neffective, as the study group only exists as long as its members consider it has a \u201cuseful purpose\u201d (Art. \n10 ToRLZ). Additionally, the fact that two more metal study groups were established shortly after the \ndemise of the Sixth International Tin Agreement in 1985 shows that information gathering and \nexchange is valued by states. However, there is no information on the extent to which the groups\u2019 work \ninfluences their member\u2019s policies and actions. Although their terms of references disclose a strong \nfocus on metal markets, new topics, such as sustainability, have been added to the agenda.490 As a \nresult, the study groups\u2019 focus can be adapted according to upcoming interests, preventing them to \nbecome obsolete.  \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: \n \n482 See Common Fund for Commodities, International Commodity Bodies at http://common-fund.org/about-\nus/partners/icbs/.  \n483 See the section on the CFC. \n484 See International Copper Study Group, \u201cMembers & Observers\u201d, http://www.icsg.org/index.php/who-we-are/members-\n&-observers and International Nickel Study Group, \u201cMembership: Permanent Observers\u201d, available at: \nhttp://www.insg.org/members.aspx.  \n485 See logos on the website of the International Study Group for Copper: http://www.icsg.org/.  \n486 International Nickel Study Group, \u201cEnvironmental and Economic Activities\u201d, available at: \nhttp://www.insg.org/economic14.aspx; Smale, Don, \u201cReview and Outlook for Copper, Nickel, Lead and Zinc\u201d, presentation \nheld at the Multy-Year Expert Meeting on Com-modities and Development 2013, Geneva, 20 March 2013, at 2. \n487 Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Energie (2017) at 11. \n488 Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Energie (2017) at 11. \n489 Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Energie (2017) at 11. \n490 Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Energie (2017) at 11.

It established a Council with the mandate to collect information on tin and influence the tin \nmarket. A major objective of the Agreement was to enhance the economies of developing producer \ncountries. Its impact on resource efficiency was high due to the possibility to influence price stability \nthrough market interventions such as buying and selling tin in the market and obligatory floor and \nceiling prices. In the mid-1980s the International Tin Council became insolvent and caused a major \ncrisis of the tin industry and metals markets. Due to loss of membership, the Sixth International Tin \nAgreement was neither extended nor renewed. \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  The Sixth International Tin Agreement491 (ITA 6) was the last agreement of this \nseries that started in 1954.492 Every five years, a new international tin agreement was drafted in order \nto adapt to the market.493 ITA 6 entered into force provisionally in 1982, due to lack of membership,494 \n \n491 Sixth International Tin Agreement (with annexes).

Although the \nobjectives primarily aimed at supporting developing producing countries, 498 they can indirectly \ninfluence resource efficiency. Maintaining an artificial high price of tin, for instance, may lead to \noverproduction even though there might not be enough buyers. In this respect, the ITA aimed to \n\u201crestore equilibrium between supply and demand\u201d.499 \nTerritorial scope:  The Agreement was open to all states. However, parties were categorized in \n\u201cProducing\u201d or \u201cConsuming\u201d Members (Art. 5(1)) and their membership was based on their domestic \nmine production or their consumption of tin (Art. 5(2)). In practice this amounted to an inherent \ngeographical restriction because not all states produced or consumed sufficient amounts of tin or did \nnot intend to participate. Notwithstanding, the overall aim of the activities of the International Tin \nCouncil was to influence world tin prices which might have affected non-contracting parties.  \nResources covered: The agreement covered tin metal. Furthermore, the Council was supposed to \nencourage close relationships with organizations focusing on efficient tin exploration and production \n(Art. 10(d)). \nSteps of the value chain covered:  The ITA 6 covered explicitly the production and consumption of tin \nmetal, i.e. mining as well as import and export. It did not directly address manufacturing, recycling or \nwaste disposal. Yet, market price changes triggered by the Council could impact other stages of the \nlifecycle by either making tin cheaper or more expensive, thereby increased or decreased use by \nmanufacturers. \nType of steering mechanism: The International Tin Council, established by the previous ITAs, continued \nto exist under ITA 6. It could request data about tin metal, should keep itself informed about \ndevelopment on the tin market, and was mandated to engage in direct market interventions such as \nbuying and selling tin, setting ceiling ad floor prices and export control. It also used in financial tools, \nnotably borrowing, in order to finance its activities.500 Thus, it combined information, regulatory and \nfinancial tools. For its functions, the Council could utilise the \u201cbuffer stock\u201d which contained tin stocks \nprovided by the members. If members did not comply with their obligations under the treaty, the \nCouncil could impose sanctions. Market interventions of the International Tin Council, accordingly \ntook two forms: buffer stock operations and export controls.501 \nContent \nRelevant obligations for parties: Members had to finance the Administrative Account for administrative \nexpenses of the Council and the Buffer Stock Account for the Council\u2019s activities. The Council could \noblige members to provide information about the consumption or extraction of tin .

The New International Economic Order was \nestablished by the UN General Assembly in 1974, inter alia , promoting just and equitable prices of raw materials and primary \ncommodities. Its aim was to balance the economies of (newly independent) developing countries and industrialised \ncountries. See Resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly (3201(S-VI)): Declaration of a New International Economic \nOrder. 1 May 1974, available at: http://www.un-documents.net/s6r3201.htm. \n499 Behrendt (1985), at 196. \n500 Raffaelli (1995), at 187. \n501 Gilbert (1987), at 609. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n124 obligations enhance transparency and awareness and facilitate tin supply management. The Council\u2019s \nhad the power to set ceiling and floor prices, supplemented by export restrictions and quotas. This \ninstrument was a strong market intervention instrument for managing tin supply, with a \ncorresponding influence on this aspect of resource efficiency. Artificially high prices due to floor prices \ncan potentially lead to increased efficiency on the demand side.  \nAdditionally, the Agreement imposes a soft obligation on its Members, who were obliged to \n\u201cencourage the conservation of the natural resources of tin by preventing the premature abandonment \nof deposits\u201d (Art. 41(3)(c)). Therefore, was directed at exploiting deposits efficiently. \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : The International Tin Agreements established the International Tin Council (ITC) that was \ncontinued in the ITA 6. It had legal personality and notably the power to borrow money. It was \nassisted by seven subsidiary bodies, e.g. an Economic and Price Review Panel and a Statistical \nCommittee.  \nEvaluation and review: There were two provisions which provided opportunities to review the \nAgreement: Firstly, the Council could recommend to the Members amendments to the Agreement. In \norder to do so, it needed the support of two thirds from consuming and producing members \nrespectively (Art. 57 (1)). The members could then ratify them or withdraw from the treaty. Secondly, \nthe duration of the agreement was in principle limited to five years. An extension of not more than two \nyears was possible but required two-third majorities by consuming and producing countries \nrespectively. The regular expiry and re-adoption of the International Tin Agreements also provided \ntheir Members with the possibility to amend the treaty according to their needs without the restriction \nof having to either accept or reject Council recommendations.  \nReporting: The ITA requires members to give information about their tin production and \nconsumptions as well as the tin market. If a producing country makes special deposits, it is under the \nobligation to notify the ITC. Art. 13(8) says that no information concerning the administration or \noperation of this agreement shall be revealed by a member of staff except authorised by Council.  \nArt. 7(f) obliges the ITC to annually report on its activities to the members.  \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: Council decisions under the ITA \nwere binding on members. The Council could oblige members to make an additional contribution to \nthe buffer stock, if the member exceeded the export quota set by it. This contribution would not exceed \nthe allowed exports. Another option was to lower the export quota for the respective country. If these \ntwo measures were not successful, the Council could decide to lower this member\u2019s part of the \nliquidation part pertaining to it according to article 26(1). Following the International Tin Council\u2019s \ninsolvency, claims were made against the member states but were unsuccessful because of the \nseparate legal personality of the International Tin Council.  \nStakeholder and public involvement: The ITA 6 does not contain provisions concerning stakeholder and \npublic involvement.  \nAssessment  \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies:  The ITAs aimed at the support of the \nprinciples of the United Nations, especially the principles from the UN Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment. In that regard, the Council was able to make the appropriate arrangements to cooperate \nwith and consult the UN, UNCTAD, and other organs or organisations related to the UN (Art. 8 (h)(i)). \nArticle 25 of the ITA 6 provided for the possibility to negotiate an association agreement with the \nCommon Fund of Commodities.  FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n125 Political weight of the instrument: Especially in between the fifth and sixth ITAs, the ITA suffered a \nmembership loss502 and was faced more and more by an \u201coutsider problem\u201d503. Bolivia and the USA \nwithdrew from the treaty and sold tin outside the reach of the ITC.504 Russia was also not a Member of \nthe ITA 6. New producing countries, such as Brazil, could not be convinced to accede, 505 which was a \nmajor drawback as it impeded the effectiveness of the International Tin Council\u2019s price stability \nmeasures. Even members undermined the work of the ITC by smuggling tin outside their countries to \navoid the quotas and sanctions.506 As a consequence the political weight of the sixth International Tin \nAgreement was low.  \nEffectiveness:  The effectiveness of the Council\u2019s market measures is in dispute.507 One argument is that \nthe Council could not effectively maintain its floor price throughout the entire time of the duration of \nits activity. Others argue that the Council achieved substantial price stabilisation over a considerable \nperiod of time. 508 The fact that the first International Tin Agreement came into force in 1956 and was \nfollowed by five further agreements underlines that the ITAs were effective during the first years. \nHowever, as the tin agreements exclusively regulated tin and excluded other metals, the effectiveness \nof the agreement was jeopardised by cheaper substitute metals which interfered with the tin market. \n509 Together with the membership loss and emerging new producing non-Members, the effectiveness \nof the ITA was reduced. It ceased to have control over the global tin market. 510 Extensive use of the \nbuffer stock in order to maintain the tin price and less membership contribution due to membership \nloss eventually led to the insolvency of the International Tin Council in 1985.511 It was argued that one \nreason for the failure of the ITA 6 was poor drafting: whether or not the ITC\u2019s buffer stock actions \ncomplied with the provisions of the sixth ITA, and member states\u2019 responsibility for debts were \nunclear. 512 \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: \n\u25ba The obligation to \u201cencourage the conservation of the natural resources of tin by preventing \nthe premature abandonment of deposits\u201d (Art. 41(3)(c)) \n\u25ba Price regulation could increase resource efficiency by influencing supply and demand. \nHowever, it is a complex instrument and its effects are difficult to predict or control.  \n \n502 Mallory (1990), at 847. \n503 Behrendt (1985), at 193. \n504 Mallory (1990), at 846 and 882. \n505 Anderson and Gilbert (1988), at 5. \n506 Gilbert (1987), at 611 and Chandrasekhar (1989), at 313. \n507 Mallory (1990), at 849. \n508 Mallory (1990), at 849; Gilbert (1987), at 612. \n509 Chandrasekhar (1989), at 314. \n510 Chandrasekhar (1989), at 312f. \n511 Anderson and Gilbert (1988), at 6. \n512 Gilbert (1987), at 613f.

They \naim at securing the resource supply for Germany and also at increasing German governmental support \nto the partner states, inter alia, with regard to resource efficiency. Despite their primarily economic \nnature, the agreements impact resource efficiency directly and indirectly by explicitly mentioning it as \na focus point for cooperation and by imposing measures that have the potential to increase resource \nefficiency in the long run. Their main goal, nevertheless, is access to and comprehensive use of \nresources, which impedes resource efficiency.  \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  The three bilateral agreements between Germany, Kazakhstan,513 Mongolia,514 \nand Peru515 will be analysed together, because their structure and even wording are very similar.516 \nThey are binding international treaties that entered into force on the day of their respective \nsignatures; in the case of the Peru Agreement, at the moment the Peruvian government formally \nnotified Germany that all national requirements for its entry in force are fulfilled.

Whenever necessary, differences will be pointed out.  \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n128 contracting party terminates it with one year\u2019s notice. In Germany, the agreements were concluded by \nthe government and did not require parliamentary approval.517 \nObjectives:  The overall objective of the three agreements is the promotion of economic cooperation in \nthe mineral raw materials sector between Germany and the partner state (Art. 1 (1) of the Kazakhstan \nAgreement, the Mongolia Agreement, and the Peru Agreement). They primarily aim at securing raw \nmaterial supply (Art. 1(2) of all Agreements) and at a comprehensive use of the resources available in \nKazakhstan, Mongolia, and Peru. The agreements mention \u201csustainability\u201d,518 but it plays a subordinate \nrole. The wording of the Peru Agreement shows that environmental and social considerations gained \nmore weight in the negotiations that took place three years later than the other two agreements. \nEnhancing resource efficiency is explicitly included in the list of main points of cooperation between \nGermany and the three other states (Art. 2(3) of the Agreements).  \nTerritorial scope:  The agreements cover the territory of Germany and the respective partner state.  \nResources covered:  Mineral resources in Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Peru are covered by the \nagreements.519 \nSteps of the value chain covered:  The agreements cover the entire value chain, from exploration to \nprocessing and use of the minerals.  \nType of steering mechanism: The agreements mainly rely on mutual cooperation.520 They do not grant \nexclusive access rights or promise a certain quota of raw materials for German companies.521 The Peru \nAgreement entails regulatory tools , as it obliges the government of Peru to comply with \n\u201cinternational environmental and social standards\u201d522 (Art. 6 (4) of the Peru Agreement). In the other \ntwo agreements, the German government is obliged to support the other two states in the \nimplementation of environmental and social standards.  \nContent \nRelevant obligations for parties: Germany, Mongolia and Kazakhstan are required to strive for \nstabilization of the framework for cooperation in the raw material sector (Art. 6 (1) of the Mongolia \nand Kazakhstan Agreement). Peru and Germany, commit to strengthening a stable, legal framework \n(Art. 6 (1) Peru Agreement). \nAll three Agreements mention improving resource efficiency as one of the main areas of cooperation \n(Art. 2 (3)). Germany is under an obligation in all three Agreements to provide advice on resource \nefficiency. Only in the case of Kazakhstan and Mongolia, the advice is specifically aimed at supporting \nthe partner country.523 In the Mongolia Agreement, Germany has the obligation to support Mongolia in \nelaborating measures to improve resource and energy efficiency (Art. 6 (7)). Conversely, in the Peru \nAgreement, there is an obligation on Peru to take measures to improve resource and energy efficiency \n(Art. 6 (4)). \nDespite these provisions, the agreements are clearly directed at enabling the German partner states to \nfully realize their resource potential and at facilitating access to resources: Several of the other main \n \n517 Antwort der Bundesregierung auf die \u201cKleine Anfrage der Fraktion B\u00dcNDNIS 90/DIE GR\u00dcNEN betr.: \u201aUmsetzung der \nRohstroffstrategie der Bundesregierung\u2018\u201c BT-Drucksache: 17/13212, at 18f. \n518 For instance, sustainable resource supply and sustainable use of resources in Art. 2 (2) of all Agreements. \n519 The full resource potential of K, M, and P is to be exhausted, as mentioned explicitly in the agreements. Conversely, \nGerman resources are not covered by the agreements. \n520 This is already suggested by their titles which explicitly states\u201d cooperation on raw-materials\u201c. \n521 Dahlmann and Mildner (2012) at 2. \n522 Explicitly including ILO Convention No. 169, to which Peru was already a party. \n523 Art. 6 (4) for Kazakhstan, 6 (5) for Mongolia, 6 (3) for Peru. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n129 areas and provisions are about facilitating access. The governments of Mongolia and Kazakhstan are \nrequired to provide or guarantee non-discriminatory and fair access to raw materials for German \nbusinesses,524 whereas the government of Peru is merely required to support German businesses in \ntheir activities in Peru, especially in the purchase of raw materials.525 The governments of Mongolia \nand Kazakhstan support raw material measures undertaken by the German government (Art. 6 (6) \nMongolia Agreement, Art. 6 (5) Kazakhstan Agreement). There is a clear focus on facilitating access to \nresources for German businesses, which is a disincentive to increase resource efficiency. For instance, \nthe provision on the envisaged projects and measures explicitly mentions exploration, extraction, \nutilization, and processing of resources but not efficiency (see e.g. Art. 4 (1) of all agreements). The \nlatter could possibly by addressed under \u201cutilisation\u201d and \u201cprocessing\u201d. The provision on supporting \ncompanies and business associations does not mention efficiency.  \nThe obligations of the German government differ slightly between the agreements but have a common \ndirection: They mostly include the obligation to support German businesses as well as businesses from \nthe other state in their activities in the raw material sector, such as processing resources. In Mongolia \nand Kazakhstan, the support includes export credit insurance, investment guarantees, untied financial \nloans for German businesses, and development aid to the respective partner state.526 The conditions \nfor financial support are not specified by the agreements. It has been pointed out that this is a missed \nopportunity to impose environmental and social requirements on businesses,527 and this argument can \napplied to resource efficiency as well. Such a provision is not included in the Peru Agreement, \naccording to which the German government is only required to support businesses, not limited to their \nnationality, in establishing contacts (Art. 6(3)).528 The German government shall also provide advice \non issues such as the exploration, exploitation, extraction, processing and usage of resources (Art. 6 \n(3) of the Peru Agreement), and the establishment of industry clusters (Art. 6 (4) of the Kazakhstan \nAgreement). In the Peru Agreement, environmental and sustainability considerations have gained \nweight.529 This shift has the potential to enhance resource efficiency in Peru, but the focus of the Peru \nAgreement remains to extend the Peruvian industry. \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : Each of the three agreements establishes a so-called Government Working Group on \nCooperation in the Field of Raw Materials, which regularly engages in a partnership dialogue (Art. 3 \n(1) of all of the Agreements).530 The Peru Agreement states that the Government Working Group meets \nat least every two years. The other agreements are silent on this, but by 2015 the Working Group with \nKazakhstan had already met nine times.531 In addition, an Economic Committee for Cooperation in the \nFields of Raw Materials, Industry and Technology is set up by the Kazakhstan and Mongolia \nagreements. It consists of representatives of businesses and business associations who meet up at \nleast once a year and report to the Government Working Group. The Peru Agreement does not set up \nsuch a committee.  \nThe parties or the Government Working Group may agree on specific projects and measures in the \nresource sector and mandate and supervise Implementing Organisations.  \n \n524 Art. 6 (5) for Kazakhstan, Art. 6 (6) for Mongolia. \n525 Art. 6(3) for Peru. \n526 Art. 6 (3) for Kazakhstan, Art. 6 (2) for Mongolia. \n527 Krajewski (2013) at 3 and 12. \n528 Art. 6 (4) of the Kazakhstan Agreement, Art. 6 (5) of the Peru Agreement contain the same requirement. \n529 See Art. 6 (4) of the Peru Agreement. \n530 The names of the Working Groups differ slightly but not significantly.  \n531 Antwort der Bundesregierung auf die Kleine Anfrage der Abgeordneten Gehrcke, Groth, Hahn und der Fraktion DIE LINKE, \nDrucksache 18/7336, 10 January 2016 at 3. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n130 Evaluation and review: The Government Working Groups on Cooperation in the Field of Raw Materials \nunder each agreement meet at least every two years to discuss the implementation of the respective \nagreements, objectives, main focus, and measures of the future cooperation regarding the agreement. \nBy mutual agreement, the contracting parties to each of the three agreements can amend the \nagreements. \nReporting \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: Disputes arising from the \napplication or interpretation of the agreements shall be solved in consultation. Besides, the \nimplementing organisations532 are to establish agreements according to their competences and \nnational laws that, inter alia , set up a monitoring process with regard to the cooperation measures that \nthey supervise (Art. 4(2) No. 5 Kazakhstan and Mongolia Agreements). Their activity is, in return, \nsupervised by the Government Working Groups. The Government Working Groups also supervise \nother implementing projects that aim at the implementation of the agreement and, therefore, receive \nreports by the Economic Committee about the state of implementation of the agreement. \nStakeholder and public involvement: The agreements explicitly aim at promoting the cooperation of \ncompanies in the resource sector, and the parties commit to engage companies and business \nassociations comprehensively in the implementation of the agreements (Art. 5 of all agreements). \nKazakhstan, Mongolia and Peru are obliged to support German companies in the acquisition of raw \nmaterials, investments and technology transfer. The German government assists companies in various \nmatters such as establishing contacts to the relevant ministries. \nRepresentatives of companies and industry associations of the parties may participate in the Economic \nCommittees of the Kazakhstan and Mongolia agreements. The agreements only envisage the \ninvolvement of companies and the raw material industry; NGOs are not mentioned and do not seem to \nhave a role in the agreements. This focus on business stakeholders underlines the main objective of \nthe agreements to secure raw material supply and its comprehensive utilisation. Another type of \nstakeholder involvement in the agreements is the education of professionals and leaders and the \nconnection of research institutions in the field of raw materials.  \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: Bilateral agreements that ensure access to \nmineral resources to one party, such as Germany, implement the principle of permanent sovereignty \nover natural resources (PSNR). Peru, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia exercise their right based on PSNR to \ngrant access to their resources to German actors.  \nAll of the agreements refer to the principle of sustainability: The raw material partnerships \nestablished by the agreements are desired to be in favour of sustainable economic and social \ndevelopment (3rd recital of the Preamble of each agreement). Sustainable utilisation and development \n(Art. 2(3)) and sustainable cooperation (chapeau of Art. 2(3)) are overarching goals of the three \nagreements.  \nThe Mongolia Agreement explicitly stated that its provisions shall not interfere with the provisions of \nthe WTO. This is not specifically mentioned in the other two agreements, but both of the partner states \nare party to the WTO (Kazakhstan in 2015 and Peru in 1995).533  \n \n532 It is not specified in the agreements which organization constitutes an \u201cimplementing organization\u201d. There was no \ninformation on implementing organizations publically available at this point. \n533 See https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org6_e.htm.  \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n131 The Peru Agreement states that Germany and Peru support the Extractive Industries Transparency \nInitiative (EITI) (Art. 2 (4)). No such reference is included in the other two agreements although \nMongolia participates in the initiative since 2007534 and Kazakhstan since 2013535. Peru also has to \nensure compliance with environmental and social standards according to its international obligations \n(Art. 6 (4) of the Peru Agreement).  \nPolitical weight of the instrument: Their international political weight is limited as the agreements only \napply to Germany and its partner states. They might become part of Germany\u2019s state practice over \ntime. \nInternally, the agreements are an important aspect of the German Resource Strategy of 2010, \nresponding to the interest of German businesses to secure resource supply.536 Kazakhstan is the most \nimportant trade partner of Germany in central Asia,537 which gives the agreement political importance. \nFor Mongolia, the percentage of exports to Germany has remained very low, as Mongolia heavily relies \non its neighbours China and Russia.538 Germany is a major trading partner for Peru.539 Diversification \nof sources for resources is a key aspect of the German raw materials strategy.540 They are political \nflanking measures that aim to facilitate the involvement of German businesses abroad.541 \nAlthough the agreements mention resource efficiency, it mostly seems to be paying lip service, as the \nfocus of most provisions is on facilitating access. \nEffectiveness:  Although providing advice on resource efficiency is one obligation for the German \ngovernment, the main objective is to support the resource industry in Germany and the respective \npartner state. The main focus on access and comprehensive resource utilisation impedes resource \nefficiency (see obligations).  \nThere was a slight increase in imports from Mongolia between 2011 and 2015.542 No similar data \nappears to be available for Kazakhstan, but at least 9 meetings of the German Kazakhstan Government \nWorking Group took place.543 There is no information regarding the Peru Agreement. Given that all of \nthe agreements, especially the Peru Agreement, are recent, assessing their effectiveness is speculative \nat this stage. Given the the main focus of the agreements, it it needs to be considered whether \nincluding (only) companies and business associations, and developing the partner states\u2019 industry are \neffective strategies for resource efficiency.  \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: \n\u25ba Resource efficiency can be introduced as a topic for the partnership dialogue, on the basis \nof art 2 (3), in order to put it on the agenda and raise its political importance. \n\u25ba Although the nature of the envisaged \u201cimplementing organisations\u201d is not defined, civil \nsociety organisations are not explicitly mentioned and likely to be excluded.

A possibility to achieve this is to link the benefits for companies provided by the \ngovernments to requirements concerning, inter alia , resource efficiency.545 Export credit \ninsurance from the German government could require compliance with certain standards, \ntransfer of technology, or the requirement to partially hire local workers to increase \nresource efficiency and knowledge about it in the respective partner state. \n \n2.1.3 Overall assessment of the legal framework \nThis assessment provides a bird\u2019s eye view on the treaties and principles reviewed in respect of \nwhether and how they affect resource efficiency. It is necessarily generalising and focuses on main \nfeatures.  \nInternational law is traditionally based on sovereignty of states, as reflected in the principle of \npermanent sovereignty over natural resources. The rise of environmental concerns since the early \n1970s has been mainly reflected in new environmental treaties or greening existing treaties, and also \nin customary obligations and general concepts that influence political discourse and governance \nframework. They balance and limit sovereignty based on the interests of other states, to protect areas \nbeyond national jurisdiction or for matters considered to be in the common interest of all states.  \nWith regard to actual or proposed obligations other than treaties, there are several problems in \nassessing the actual and potential application of customary law, general \u201cprinciples\u201d and concepts  \nto resource efficiency. Terminology  is inconsistent. Terms such as \u201cprinciples\u201d are sometimes used to \ndenote norms that have a higher level of abstraction than \u201crules\u201d and that may guide interpretation \nrather than prescribe specific conduct or outcomes. While this to some extent may be a useful \napproach, there is no general practice or accepted legal meaning, and it does not answer the question \nwhether or not a particular principle is customary law or not. The legal status  of many principles and \nconcepts as customary law is not clearly established. There is also often a lack of clarity or agreement \nregarding the actual content and legal consequences of the principle in question, e.g. what it would \nrequire states to do, or which direction interpretation should take, if the princple was law. The \nprecautionary principle is an example of divergent assessments by states as well as judiciary bodies \nregarding both legal status and content.  \nAnother apparent impediment  for anchoring resource efficiency is that it is difficult to define and link \nthe environmental impact of inefficiency to the principles. There are several interrelated conceptual \ndifficulties: When does an \u201cinefficient\u201d use of a resource have an environmental impact that is covered \nby the scope of the principle in question? There is e.g. no indication that the established legal \nrequirement to carry out an impact assessment for certain activities would have to address the \nefficiency of the resource use involved. When, and by which standard, does the use of resources \nbecome \u201cinefficient\u201d in a sense relevant for the principle? Which link and causation between a \nparticular use of a resource and an environmental impact would be required for the principle to apply? \nFor instance, when would resource use be so inefficient as to amount to environmental harm or to a \n \n544 Krajewski (2012) at 2 points out that the involvement of civil society also has the potential to diminish human rights \nissues. \n545 Krajewski (2012) at 3. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n133 legally unacceptable depletion of resources for future use? Some of these questions could be left to \nsubsequent practice if resource efficiency was brought within the scope of the principle in question.  \nThese legal and conceptual uncertainties have to be taken into account  when exploring political \nopportunities and developing strategies and policies for resource efficiency. The context for making an \nargument, for instance, that one of the principles requires states to be resource efficient, will be \ndifferent when it is contested that the principle is binding in the first place. \nWith regard to individual obligations, some principles, such as sustainable development, serve as a \ncounterweight to the sovereign right to exploit natural resources and as an argument that there is a \nlimit to this right. But they do not on their own provide concrete normative content or political \nopportunities specifically for resource efficiency. However, they could be used to strengthen strategies \nand arguments involving other principles. For instance, the principle of common but differentiated \nresponsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of national circumstances, could be useful in \nconsidering differentiated standards for resource efficiency and increase political buy-in in particular \nby developing countries.  \nIn contrast, the obligations to prevent transboundary environmental harm, to carry out an \nenvironmental impact assessment and to be legally responsible for breaches of such obligations are \nestablished in customary law. However, they are conceptually based on notions of environmental \nharm and attribution that pose significant difficulties for addressing resource efficiency. \nSome principles such as equitable utilisation and common areas contain, at least generally, the notion \nthat states have to use resources in a way that enables other states to use that resource as well. \nHowever, state practice on transboundary mineral deposits shows that the principle is exclusively \nconcerned with the allocation of the resources or the profits resulting from exploitation between the \nparties concerned. The legal content of these principles is mainly procedural and they hardly address \nthe conservation aspect over time. This also applies to the concept of common heritage of mankind, \nalthough it goes further as it places the exploitation of certain resources under common management.  \nThe principle of common concern of humankind differs from other principles relating to natural \nresources in that it does not regulate the distribution of resources, but expresses the common interest \nof all states in certain forms of ecological protection. This approach could provide political \nopportunities relating to climate change in the Paris Agreement and perhaps more generally e.g. if \nstates regarded the conservation of resources over time as a common concern.  \nApplying the polluter pays principle or the precautionary principle to resource efficiency also poses \ndifficulties, besides their unsettled legal status in international law. Using the polluter pays principle to \naddress inefficiency, either directly or by analogy, would mean that inefficiency would be treated as \ncontributing to environmental harm, an inefficient user would be treated like a \u201cpolluter\u201d, and the \nenvironmental costs caused by the inefficency would be internalised. The underpinnings of the \nprecautionary principle aim at addressing scientific uncertainty about environmental impacts, which \nis of little relevance to resource efficiency. Taking this into account, political opportunities stemming \nfrom these principles might include interpreting norms that aim at managing and conserving \nresources or at reducing environmental impacts resulting from increased demand.  \nGenerally, customary law and proposed principles and concepts do not provide much established \nnormative guidance with regard to resource efficiency. There are political opportunites  to establish \nmore specific duties and guidance, e.g. in combination with other sources. The principle of inter-\ngenerational equity, for instance, could support arguments that a principle that is focused on allocation \nof resources also includes conservation over time. The same goes for exisiting institutions with a \nmandate to implement the obligations in relation to specific resources or areas. However, \nstrengthening the legal status of some principles is unlikely to be sufficient in particular where their \ncontent poses conceptual difficulties  for resource efficiency.  FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n134 With regard to treaties, those analysed in this study differ widely in subject matter and regulatory \ntechnique. Specifically with regard to resource efficency, the treaties differ e.g. with regard to which \npart of the value chain they address, whether they address specific resources, and how they affect \nresource efficency:  \nFor instance, the deep seabed regime under UNCLOS directly regulates all mineral resources in a \nspecific geographical area at the very beginning of the value chain . Its objective is to distribute the \nopportunities for revenue and there are no incentives for using the resource more efficiently after \nextraction. There is also little indication that it intends to limit the amounts extracted in order to \npreserve supplies over time. However, the strict and detailed extraction management could have the \neffect of impeding extraction and thus providing incentives to use those resources more efficiently. \nThe London Protocol affects all resources by regulating the very end of the value chain , i.e. by \ncreating economic incentives as well as obligations to generate less waste and to recycle more. The \nmain regulatory technique is a prohibition of cheap ways of disposing waste. \nThe Minamata Convention directly regulates one specific resource  - mercury- along the whole \nvalue chain . Its objective is not to use mercury more efficiently but to stop producing and using it \naltogether. But it provides a toolbox of different regulatory techniques for using less mercury, both \nduring the phase-out and for the ban. \nGermany\u2019s three bilateral resource treaties apply to all mineral resources under the jurisdiction of the \nparties, although in effect they address the resources in Germany\u2019s respective partner countries. All \nthree agreements explicitly address resource efficiency, albeit the actual obligations are few and \nremain abstract. It is the host country that is to improve resource efficiency, not the country seeking \naccess to more resources. The clear normative focus of the agreements is to facilitate access to \nresources and resource efficiency has minimal weight in comparison.  \nThe Montreal Protocol and the Stockholm Convention regulate specific substances which are not \nabiotic resources. They affect only resources that are used in the substance\u2019s regulated part of the \nvalue chain. The treaties provide an incentive for resource efficiency only if substituting the regulated \nsubstance does not use the same amount of resources. The regulatory techniques are interesting \nbecause they include trade restrictions that also apply to non-parties. They are also designed to \nrespond to new challenges flexibly and comparatively fast. \nThe Paris Agreement addresses activities that contribute to climate change, notably greenhouse gas \nemissions and to some extent sinks, towards the objective of a collective global temperature limit. It \ndoes not regulate specific activities, substances or resources, but it potentially affects all resources that \ncontribute to climate change. According to the current state of scientific knowledge, the goals of the \nParis Agreement can only be achieved if the use of fossil fuels  is drastically reduced in the medium \nterm and phased out by about 2050. However, the Paris Agreement contains mainly procedural \nobligations which leave parties much discretion to define which individual measures they want to take \ntowards the collective goals. The potential substitution effects of the transition to a low-carbon \neconomy are difficult to fully assess at this stage. Since the parties are in the process of negotiating \ndetails on implementing the Paris Agrement, there might be political opportunites for addressing links \nbetween resource efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions.  \nThe International Metal Study Groups specifically address four abiotic resources worldwide: lead, zinc, \nnickel and copper. Their regulatory approach is to influence decision-makers by providing information \non supply and demand and other market developments. They also address resource efficiency, but it is \nnot clear to what extent this promotes or enables resource efficiency. \nThe mandate of the Common Fund for Commodities includes all abiotic resources that qualify as \ntradable commodities. Its regulatory technique today is mainly financing commodity development \nprojects, focused on the commodity instead of particular countries. These include projects that FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n135 promote resource efficiency. The CFC currently appears to move away from addressing abiotic \nresources. \nThe International Tin Agreement can provide relevant insights although it has been terminated after \nthe International Tin Council went insolvent. It exclusively addressed tin and had a high impact on \nresource efficiency because its mandate was to maintain price stability through market interventions \nsuch as buying and selling tin in the market and obligatory floor and ceiling prices. It also used \nfinancial tools, notably borrowing, in order to finance its activities. One lesson learned is that if such \ninstruments are to be used at all, they should be clearly mandated and controlled so as to avoid the \nfinancial risks that eventually led to the Tin Agreement\u2019s demise.  \nNone of the treaties assessed address resource efficiency explicitly, with the exception of Germany\u2019s \nbilateral resource treaties with Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Peru. It is interesting that these agreements \naim at improving resource efficiency in the host country rather than addressing Germany as the \ncountry seeking improved access. The few other instances in which efficiency is mentioned refer to e.g. \nefficient extraction but not efficiency in the sense of a sparing use of the resource.  \nThe treaties have effects on different aspects of resource efficiency : One aspect is whether the \nintention of resource efficiency is to use the resource as long as possible, or to not use the resource at \nall. From this perspective, a ban on using the resource would be resource conserving but not resource \nefficient in a narrow sense, because the resource may not be used at all. The phasing out and ban of \nmercury under the Minamata Convention provides an example, as well as the (not explicit but \nnecessary) phasing out of fossil fuels under the Paris Agreement. A normative or factual ban can \nprovide a strong incentive to use the resources more efficiently until the ban applies, but this effect is \nnot inevitable. \nA different aspect is whether the objective is to achieve efficiency for a particular resource or for a \nparticular activity, i.e. reducing its overall resource footprint. Again, the Minamata Convention is an \nexample of addressing one particular resource. In contrast, the deep seabed regime seeks to avoid \nwasteful extraction for all (mineral) resources. \nPerhaps with the exception of direct market intervention in the Tin Agreement model, there is no \nparticular regulatory approach that would appear to be irrelevant or that should be disregarded from \nthe outset with regard to addressing resource efficiency. They address the beginning as well as the end \nof the value chain, a particular resource or all resources in an area, some use specific measures such as \ntrade restrictions or licensing regimes while others set an objective and follow a procedural approach. \nSome of the treaties such as the Minamata Convention and the Paris Agreement are relatively new and \ntheir impact remains to be seen. The diversity of approaches also means that the different political \nopportunities for addressing resource efficiency have to be assessed in the context of the particular \nagreement rather than in abstract.  \nAlthough their obligations potentially have more impact on resource efficiency, the treaties show a \npicture similar to customary law and emerging principles: International environmental law mainly \naddresses activites with direct physical impacts on the environment. With the exception perhaps of \nwaste, it barely touches upon environmental consequences caused by inefficient use of resources. \nWhere it does, the existing rules are mainly designed to ensure that resources are available or \ngenerate revenue.  \nThe main impediment to resource efficiency appears to be the conceptual difficulties in applying the \nexisting norms and concepts to the environmental impacts caused by inefficiency. This could be \naddressed e.g. through an appropriate interpretation of the existing norms or by designing and \nestablishing new principles or norms, e.g. specifically adressing resource efficiency. There are some \npolitical opportunities for both approaches, which will be elaborated in the section on developingthe \nexisting framework.

Furthermore, a Global Partnership is part of the Agenda 2030 which aims to \nprovide the \u201cmeans of implementation\u201d (finances etc.) for developing countries. The \u201cOne Planet \nnetwork\u201d, which formed to implement the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable \nConsumption and Production Patterns (see Section 2.2.4 in this report), is recognised as \nimplementation mechanism for SDG 12. \nEvaluation and review:  The Agenda 2030 is equipped with a review process but an evaluation as such \nis not provided for. The HLPF meets annually to review implementation of a subset of the SDGs. For \nthe SDGs listed in Fehler! Verweisquelle konnte nicht gefunden werden.  as relevant for (abiotic) \nresource efficiency, reviews were conducted in 2017 (SDG 9), 2018 (SDG 11, 12) and 2019 (SDG 8). \nReviews by the HLPF are based on the voluntary (country-led, country-driven) reviews of progress \nthat UN member states are encouraged to carry out at the national and sub-national levels (para. 79, \nUN Agenda 2030). The UN annually publishes synthesis reports on the results of the Voluntary \nNational Reviews.549  \nReporting: Reviews and reporting are voluntary (para. 84, UN Agenda 2030).  In addition to a set of \nuniversal indicators, nations are encouraged to further develop their own country-specific indicators \nfor measuring their progress in achieving the SDGs. Developing countries are provided financial \nassistance for developing their statistical capabilities.  \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: There are no formal compliance \nprocedures, though soft political pressure as well as public or stakeholder pressure may support \nnational commitment to implementing the SDGs.  \nStakeholder and public involvement: During the development of the  SDGs, the UN Department of \nEconomic and Social Affairs\u2019 (UNDESA) Division for Sustainable Development (DSD) coordinated the \ninvolvement of \u201cmajor groups\u201d550 and other stakeholders (MGoS). Since adoption of the SDGs, the \nHLPF reviews are to include the participation of stakeholders, including civil society and the private \nsector, and to \u201cprovide a platform for partnerships, including through the participation of major \ngroups and other relevant stakeholders\u201d (Para. 84, Agenda 2030). In addition, the HLPF is to \u201csupport \nparticipation in follow-up and review processes by the major groups and other relevant stakeholders\u201d \n(Para. 89, Agenda 2030). Since 2016, a HLPF MGoS Coordination Mechanism (HLPF CM) is operational \nto ensure stakeholder participation in the HLPF. In addition, specific events are geared towards \nengaging different stakeholder groups in the SDG follow-up, including Partnership Exchange events, \nthe annual SDG Business Forum, or the annual multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and \nInnovation for the SDGs (STI Forum).  \nAt domestic level, the Voluntary National Reviews shall \u201cbe state-led, involving ministerial and other \nrelevant high-level participants. They shall provide a platform for partnerships, including through the \nparticipation of major groups and other relevant stakeholders\u201d (para. 84, UN Agenda 2030). The \nmodalities of MGoS participation are decided on by the respective UN member states.  \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: The Agenda 2030 takes up relevant \ninternational commitments, either referencing them or turning them into goals/targets. With \nrelevance to resource efficiency, the implementation of the 10-year framework of programmes on \n \n549 See e.g. UN ECOSOC (2018), (2019). \n550 \u201cMajor Groups\u201c in UN processes include: Women, Children and Youth, Indigenous Peoples, Non-Governmental \nOrganizations, Local Authorities, Workers and Trade Unions, Business and Industry, Scientific and Technological \nCommunity, Farmers. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n140 sustainable consumption and production (10YFP), which was originally called for in the Johannesburg \nPlan of Implementation (2002) and adopted at the Rio+20 Summit, was turned into SDG 12.1. \nFurthermore, the principles of \u201creducing,\u201d \u201creusing\u201d and \u201crecycling\u201d as contained in the G8 \u201cKobe 3R \nAction Plan\u201d (2008) have been taken up in SDG 12.5, widening the base of those who apply the \nprinciples from the G8 to all UN member countries.551 \nPolitical weight of the instrument: The SDGs are one of the most relevant international frameworks of \naction today. They are comprehensive (including both social and environmental goals), ambitious \n(\u201ctransformative\u201d) and universal in scope (i.e., applicable to developing and developed countries). \nWithin their framework, national policies and priorities are respected. In procedural terms, they were \ndeveloped in broad consultation with stakeholders and have been adopted by the UN General \nAssembly. As a consequence, their political weight is substantial and their legitimacy high. Their \npractical relevance is supported by the basic indicators that guide their implementation. All UN \nmember states are expected to adjust their policies to the goals, including their priorities in the \ncontext of (uni-/ multilateral) development assistance. In addition, the SDGs provide an overarching \nframework for other UN and non-UN (e.g. World Bank) initiatives, including action by the private \nsector and civil society.  \nEffectiveness:  With regard to goals on abiotic resource efficiency, the 2019 report on progress towards \nthe SDGs assesses that with regard to material consumption (SDG 12.2) that \u201c[i]n 2017, worldwide \nmaterial consumption reached 92.1 billion tons, up from 87 billion in 2015 and a 254 per cent increase \nfrom 27 billion in 1970, with the rate of extraction accelerating every year since 2000. (\u2026) Without \nurgent and concerted political action, it is projected that global resource extraction could grow to 190 \nbillion tons by 2060. Material footprint per capita has increased considerably as well: in 1990 some 8.1 \ntons of natural resources were used to satisfy a person\u2019s need, while in 2015, almost 12 tons of \nresources were extracted per person.\u201d552  \nIn 2018, a number of UN entities provided joint recommendations to the review of Goal 12.553 In line \nwith these recommendations, a One Planet multi-partner trust fund for Goal 12 was established at the \n2018 High-level Political Forum. \nGenerally, implementation of the SDGs has started rather recently, so that is difficult to give an \nindication of their future effectiveness. Much will depend on whether the SDG\u2019s strategic political \nguidance is followed and governmental as well as non-governmental actors align their priorities \u2013 both \nwith regard to otherwise volatile attention and scarce resources \u2013 to the SDGs. Such alignment is \nvoluntary even for governments, though some political pressure, inter alia from civil society \norganisations, can be expected when governments fail to take into account the Agenda\u2019s goals. \nGoverning through goal-setting is attributed potential steering power.554 However, the fact that the \nAgenda 2030 includes a total of 17 goals and 169 targets implies that the SDGs are too all-\n \n551 Beyond the issue of resource efficiency, important agreements under the UNFCCC form part of SDG 13; provisions of the \nCBD and its Aichi Targets are part of SDG 15; the ILO\u2019s Decent Work Agenda is part of SDG 8.5, and promoting equal rights of \nmen and women as codified in various human rights treaties is part of SDG 5. Finally, under the header of \u201cstrengthening the \nmeans of implementation\u201d, Target 17.14 of the SDGs itself requires to \u201cEnhance policy coherence for sustainable \ndevelopment\u201d. \n552 UN ECOSOC (2016), at 38. \n553 UNEP et al.

An assessment of the effectiveness might draw on insights from the \nimplementation of the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), on which the SDGs are based: \nSelected MDGs were reached in various countries, but despite many successes, the poorest and most \nvulnerable people were left behind.557 \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: The SDG follow-up process provides opportunities \nto promote the implementation of resource efficiency related goals and targets, notably reviews of \nSDGs 8, 11 and 12. \nGood practice aspects in the Agenda 2030 include the inclusive process in which the SDGs were \ndeveloped; the \u2013 at least in some cases \u2013 quantified and ambitious goals defined; the accompanying set \nof indicators.  \n \n2.2.3 UN Habitat III: The New Urban Agenda \nTable 16:  The New Urban Agenda (adoption: 2016) \nKey aspects  Summary  \nForm and legal status legally non-binding UN declaration \nObjectives reinvigorate global commitment to sustainable urbanization, contribute to \nSDG implementation \nAddressees UN member states; cities/ local governments \nTerritorial scope global \nResources covered all \nStage of the value chain  all \nSteering mechanisms high-level political statement with strategic priorities and guidance \nPolitical weight moderate \nRelevance for RE some \nSummary \nThe New Urban Agenda558 was adopted by the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable \nUrban Development (Habitat III), which took place in Quito, Ecuador, from 17 to 20 October 2016. The \ndocument was formally endorsed by the UN General Assembly in December 2016. It aims at specifying \nSDG 11 (\u201cto make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable\u201d). The New Urban Agenda is a 29 page \ndocument which encompasses the \u201c Quito Declaration on Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements for \nAll\u201d and the \u201c Quito implementation plan for the New Urban Agenda \u201d. The former details a shared vision, \nprinciples & commitments and a call for action. The latter includes commitments on sustainable urban \ndevelopment, on effective implementation, on follow-up and review.

By readdressing the way cities and human settlements are planned, \ndesigned, financed, developed, governed and managed, the New Urban Agenda is claimed to \u201chelp to \nend poverty and hunger in all its forms and dimensions; reduce inequalities; promote sustained, \ninclusive and sustainable economic growth; achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all \nwomen and girls in order to fully harness their vital contribution to sustainable development; improve \nhuman health and well-being; foster resilience; and protect the environment\u201d (para 5, New Urban \nAgenda). \nTerritorial scope:  Global. \nResources covered:  Not specified; all natural resources. \nSteps of the value chain covered:  Not specified; all steps of the value chain, though implicit focus on \nresource use rather than resource extraction. \nType of steering mechanism: High-level UN statement with strategic priorities and guidance; broad \nrange of commitments, supported by \u201cmeans of implementation\u201d (finances etc.) for developing \ncountries. No set of indicators specified to measure implementation. \nContent \nRelevant provisions: Within the Quito Declaration , a \u201cshared vision\u201d is spelled out. Among various other \naspects, cities and human settlements are envisaged to \u201c[m]eet the challenges and opportunities of \npresent and future sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, leveraging (\u2026) resource \nefficiency (\u2026)\u201d (New Urban Agenda, para. 13d) and to promote \u201cresource-efficient transport systems \nfor passengers and freight\u201d (ibid, para. 13f). Moreover, citites and settlements shall \u201c[p]rotect, \nconserve, restore and promote their ecosystems, water, natural habitats and biodiversity, minimize \ntheir environmental impact and change to sustainable consumption and production patterns\u201d (ibid, \npara. 13h). No reference is made to resource efficiency in the Quito Declaration\u2019s \u201cprinciples and \ncommitments\u201d559 or its \u201cCall for action\u201d. Within the Quito implementation plan , commitments to \nresource efficiency are mainstreamed through different sections. They relate to, among others, sound \nmanagement, reduction, reuse and recycling (3Rs) of waste (ibid, para. 74) and to a circular economy \n(ibid, para. 71) as well as to resource efficiency with regard to the use of raw materials and recycled \nmaterials (ibid, para. 76), to housing (ibid, para. 32) and to infrastructures (ibid, paras 45, 77, 119). In \na more overarching way, it is recognized that \u201curban form, infrastructure and building design are \namong the greatest drivers of cost and resource efficiencies, through the benefits of economy of scale \nand agglomeration and by fostering energy efficiency, renewable energy, resilience, productivity, \n \n559 More broadly, however, \u201ce nsuring environmental sustainability\u201d is mentioned as a principle, including by \npromoting sustainable consumption and production patterns.  FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n143 environmental protection and sustainable growth in the urban economy\u201d (ibid, para. 44). On the level \nof planning and policy-making, UN members commit themselves to promoting urban spatial \nframeworks (ibid, para. 51) and enforceable regulations in the housing sector (ibid, para. 111) \nensuring, among others, resource efficiency, appropriate compactness and density. \nAs regards absolute resource consumption, however, resource efficiency commitments in the New \nUrban Agenda are counterbalanced by competing commitments to \u201csustainable and inclusive \neconomic growth\u201d whose realization would potentially induce rebound effects (i.a., paras 13(d), \n15(c)iii, 44, 62, 66, 133). \nDuring the preparatory process of developing the New Urban Agenda, several issue papers and policy \npapers were developed by stakeholders and experts in so called Policy Units. The \u201cIssue Paper on \nUrban Ecosystems and Resource Managements\u201d defines, in line with UNEP, a resource efficient city as \n\u201ca city that is significantly decoupled from resource exploitation and ecological impacts and is socio-\neconomically and ecologically sustainable in the long term\u201d. Policy Paper No. 8 on \u201cUrban Ecology and \nResilience\u201d proposes \u201cthat a city can be designed and managed to provide multiple benefits that \ncontribute to quality of human life while improving resource efficiency and reducing overall \nenvironmental impact.\u201d \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : The New Urban Agenda was developed by UN member countries in a process organised by \nthe Habitat III Secretariat, which was housed within the United Nations Human Settlements \nProgramme (UN-Habitat). UN-Habitat is the UN programme on human settlements and \u201cfocal point for \nsustainable urbanization and human settlements\u201d (ibid, para. 165). The organization is also \nresponsible for coordinating the reporting on the progress of the New Urban Agenda\u2019s implementation \n(see below). \nEvaluation and review: While quadrennial reports are to regularly review the state of implementation \n(see below), no evaluation as such is foreseen.  \nReporting : The New Urban Agenda is equipped with a periodic follow-up and review mechanism. \nCoordinated by UN-Habitat, the UN Secretary General submits every four years a report containing a \nqualitative and quantitative analysis of the progress made in the implementation of the New Urban \nAgenda and internationally agreed goals and targets relevant to sustainable urbanization and human \nsettlements (ibid, para. 166-167). The report is based on voluntary contributions of national, \nsubnational and local levels of government and supplemented by contributions from the United \nNations system, regional and subregional organizations, major groups and relevant stakeholders (ibid, \npara. 161-162). The five quadrennial reports are to be published in 2018, 2022, 2026, 2030 and 2034. \nThe 2026 report serves as a mid-term review which will specifically take stock of the progress made \nand challenges faced in the implementation of the New Urban Agenda (ibid, para. 175). Reporting \nrelated to the New Urban Agenda will largely draw on indicators and data available from the SDG \nmonitoring framework coordinated by the UN Statistics Division.560 The New Urban Agenda\u2019s \nimplementation was discussed at the UN General Assembly (2018) and the 27th session of the UN-\nHabitat Governing Council (April 2019). \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: No respective procedures exist.  \n \n560 Cf. UNGA and ECOSOC (2018), para. 29. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n144 Stakeholder and public involvement: Like all \u201cmodern\u201d international policy documents since the Rio \nDeclaration of 1992, the New Urban Agenda was developed with the participation of various types of \nstakeholders. Over 30,000 people from 167 countries participated at Habitat III, making it the \nconference with \u201cthe strongest participation of civil society, stakeholders, and local authorities in the \nhistory of the United Nations\u201d.561 Stakeholders could participate via various channels: \n\u25ba Generally, participation of (accredited) stakeholders from civil society and other non-state \nactors was organized according to the \u201cmajor groups\u201d562 structure articulated in Agenda \n21.  \n\u25ba More specifically, the General Assembly of Partners (GAP) was an innovative mechanism \ninvolving 16 Partner Constituent Groups with members from the United Nations\u2019 major \ngroups and other relevant stakeholders563 which supported stakeholders\u2019 contributions to \nthe PrepCom process and the Conference.  \n\u25ba Policy Units with up to 20 experts each brought together individual experts not only from \ngovernments and regional organisations, but from academia and civil society to identify \nchallenges, policy priorities and critical issues for the implementation of the New Urban \nAgenda and to develop action-oriented recommendations. \n\u25ba Many governments organized national-level processes of participation (e.g., the \u201cGerman \nHabitat Forum\u201d). \nAfter the Habitat III Conference, the General Assembly of Partners serves to coordinate stakeholders\u2019 \nwork related to the implementation of the New Urban Agenda. The quadrennial report should \nincorporate, \u201cwhere appropriate\u201d, contributions from civil society, the private sector and academia \n(New Urban Agenda, para. 167). \nThe New Urban Agenda itself commits UN member states to promoting national, subnational and local \nhousing policies that enable the participation and engagement of communities and relevant \nstakeholders in the planning and implementation of these policies (ibid, para. 31). \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: The New Urban Agenda is in line with and \nspecifies SDG 11. It claims to be grounded in various human rights treaties and instruments (New \nUrban Agenda, para.12) and to account of a range of international processes, including the Paris \nAgreement, the Rio, Rio+10 and Rio+20 Conferences and the World Summit for Social Development \n(cf. ibid, para. 6). During the preparatory process for the Conference, a United Nations Task Team on \nHabitat III cooperated as an inter-agency task force. Review and reporting of implementation are to be \nlinked to those of the SDGs and to feed into the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable \nDevelopment (ibid, paras 164, 168). The first quadrennial progress report on the implementation of \nthe New Urban Agenda reviews the interlinkages between global development agendas, notably SDG \n11 and the New Urban Agenda.564 \n \n561 http://habitat3.org/the-conference/participants/. \n562 \u201cMajor Groups\u201c in UN processes include: Women, Children and Youth, Indigenous Peoples, Non-Governmental \nOrganizations, Local Authorities, Workers and Trade Unions, Business and Industry, Scientific and Technological \nCommunity, Farmers. \n563 Partner Constituent Groups included local and subnational authorities; research and academia; civil society organizations; \ngrassroots organizations; women; parliamentarians; children and youth; business and industries; foundations and \nphilanthropies; professionals; trade unions and workers; farmers; indigenous people; media; older persons; and persons \nwith disabilities \u2013 thus going beyond the major groups concept. \n564 UNGA and ECOSOC (2018). \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n145 Political weight of the instrument: The political weight of the New Urban Agenda is moderate. On the \none hand, it is the outcome of an UN-wide process, and moreover one which takes place only every 20 \nyears. Also, the topic of urbanization has hugely gained in importance, with many developing and \nnewly developed countries rapidly urbanizing. With the huge amounts of resource consumption and of \nwastes/ emissions (as well as huge efficiency potentials) accruing in cities, it has been said that it will \nbe decided in cities whether the transformation towards sustainability succeeds or not. The New \nUrban Agenda lays the groundwork for policies and initiatives aiming to shape cities over the next two \ndecades. On the other hand, the weak high-level participation in the Habitat III Conference (only three \nheads of state or government attended the Conference) indicates that the issue of urbanization is \ntaken less seriously in world politics than it should be.565  \nEffectiveness: There are few indications as yet regarding national and local governments\u2019 \nimplementation efforts and the effectiveness of the New Urban Agenda. The first quadrennial report \nreviewing its implementation, issued 18 months after the adoption of the Agenda, highlights that a \nnumber of regional and sub-regional action plans have been adopted566 and that 76 (of 150 countries \nanalysed) have adopted explicit national urban policies with strong connections to the Agenda.567 The \nprogress report does not specify to what extent resource efficiency is addressed in these action plans \nor national policies. \nThe \u201cQuito Implementation Platform \u201d (QIP) collates commitments by various partners intended to \ncontribute to its implementation. It lists 70 rather diverse commitments with a project value of over \nUS-$ 730 Mio (July 2019).568 These projects range from a university chair\u2019s development of an \nassessment tool with a Life Cycle perspective for sustainable cities (US-$ 1 Mio) to the German \ngovernment\u2019s \u201cTransformative Urban Mobility Initiative\u201d (over US-$ 100 Mio).  \nThere are various factors that may impede the implementation and effectiveness of the New Urban \nAgenda: Firstly, its commitments are very broad, covering a vast range of topics related to sustainable \nurban development. Secondly, they are relatively vague and \u201caspirational\u201d. Both their width and \nvagueness make on-ground operationalization of the commitments difficult for city planners and \nstakeholder initiatives. Thirdly, the New Urban Agenda lacks a roadmap for implementation, a robust \nmonitoring mechanism569 and data exists often not at a sufficiently disaggregated level to meaningfully \nmonitor its implementation.570 At least, the 26th Governing Council of UN-Habitat decided in May 2017 \nthat a proposal should be developed for a unified global monitoring framework, to facilitate the \nsystematic tracking of progress towards achieving the goals of the New Urban Agenda and the urban \ndimension of the SDGs.571 Subsequently, the City Prosperity Initiative (CPI)572 has been proposed to \nbecome the basis for such a monitoring framework for the New Urban Agenda (as well as SDG 11). \nInternationally, the topic of urbanization and the New Urban Agenda are embedded in an overall \narchitecture (the UN system and UN-Habitat as coordinator of the implementation and review \n \n565 WBGU (2017). \n566 among others, the Urban Agenda for the European Union, the Urban Agenda of the European Union for the Mediterranean, \nthe regional action plan for implementation of the New Urban Agenda in Latin America and the Caribbean, the Arab strategy \nfor housing and sustainable urban development, the ESCAP Regional Partners Forum and the harmonized regional \nframework for the implementation and monitoring of the New Urban Agenda in Africa. \n567 UNGA and ECOSOC (2018), paras 61\u201363. \n568 http://nuaimplementation.org/.

Like urban planning \nin general, it will require strong political will, appropriate partnerships involving all relevant \nstakeholders, an enforceable and transparent legal framework, capacities for sound and flexible urban \nplanning and design, as well as a sound financial basis.574 These preconditions are not necessarily \ngiven in many cities, notably in developing countries. The financial as well as institutional capacity is \nregarded as especially limited in African cities, which exhibit some of the highest rates of urban \ngrowth.575 Also, depending on national frameworks, the political and financial leeway for local \ngovernments may be very limited, and relations between national and local leaders are strained in \nmany centralized countries. While the New Urban Agenda supports \u201cstrengthening the capacity of \nsubnational and local governments\u201d this aim is restricted by the qualification \u201cin-line with countries\u2019 \nnational legislation\u201d (New Urban Agenda, para. 90). Moreover, some observers argue that the New \nUrban Agenda is not sufficiently relevant to urban governments and urban dwellers and may therefore \nnot get their buy-in: \u201cit does not have (\u2026) any commitment to support and work with urban \ngovernments and urban civil society. Astonishingly, a document claiming to be the New Urban Agenda \nhas no mention of mayors; no mention of democracy; no mention of urban innovations such as \nparticipatory budgeting; no reference to grassroots organisations. The \u2018poor\u2019 are mentioned only in \nrelation to their needs; there is no mention of the innovations in urban agendas driven by slum/shack \ndweller federations or by other urban social movements; not much on water, sanitation, drainage and \nhealth care and nothing on electricity, emergency services, solid waste collection and policing\u201d576.  \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: The implementation of the New Urban Agenda will \nbe regularly discussed at World Urban Forum sessions; the 10th session in 2020 will start dialogues on \nthe New Urban Agenda Consultation process on the second quadrennial report (to be published in \n2022).The next UN-Habitat Governing Council (28th session, 2021) will continue this dialogue. In 2021, \nthe High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development will review Sustainable Development Goal \n11, i.e. the \u2018cities goal\u2019. These meetings as well as the New Urban Agenda\u2019s mid-term review in 2026 \nprovide opportunities where the commitments to resource efficiency could be concretised. A further \nopportunity is the future development, led by UN-Habitat, the World Bank and others, of a Multi-\nPartner Implementation Facility for Sustainable Urban Development (IFSUD). Here, resource efficiency \ncould form one funding priority. \nIn terms of good practice examples, the General Assembly of Partners (GAP) and its role of channeling \n(wide) stakeholder participation in the prepcom process of Habitat III seems a noteworthy feature. \n \n573 WBGU (2017), at 1. \n574 UN-Habitat (2015), at 3. \n575 Caprotti et al.

To increase resource efficiency and \ndecouple economic growth from environmental degradation and resource use is one of the five stated \nobjectives of the 10YFP. It is specifically referred to in SDG 8.4 and 12.1.  \nAdopted in 2012 at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro \n(Rio+20), the 10YFP serves as an umbrella for several programmes and partnerships. It fosters \nknowledge and experience sharing and facilitates access to technical and financial resources for \ndeveloping countries. UNEP serves as the 10YFP\u2019s Secretariat and administers its trust fund.  \nTo implement the commitment of the 10YFP, the \u201cOne Planet network\u201d \u2013 an open multi-stakeholder \npartnership \u2013 has formed in 2012. \nOverview \nThe 10YFP goes back to the Agenda 21\u2019s call for action and efforts \u201cto define a policy agenda on \nsustainable production and consumption\u201d. Advocated for by European countries, it was first explicitly \ncalled for in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (2002). It was then prepared in the UN \n\u201cMarrakesh Process on Sustainable Consumption and Production\u201d (2003-2012) and finally adopted in \nJune 2012 at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro (Rio+20).577 \nIn the same year, the \u201cOne Planet network\u201d was formed to implement the 10YFP commitment.578 \nForm and legal status:  The 10YFP is a legally non-binding global framework for action; participation in \nthe programmes is voluntary.  \n \n577 Barber (2010); Clark (2007). \n578 https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n148 Objectives: The 10YFP\u2019s overriding objective is to accelerate the shift towards sustainable \nconsumption and production patterns in developed and developing countries. Specifically, it pursues \nthe following objectives:579 \n\u25ba Objective 1: Support capacity building and facilitate access to financial and technical \nassistance for developing countries, supporting the implementation of SCP activities at the \nregional, sub-regional and national levels.  \n\u25ba Objective 2: Serve as an information and knowledge platform on SCP to enable all \nstakeholders to share tools, initiatives and best practices, raising awareness and enhancing \ncooperation and development of new partnerships. \n\u25ba Objective 3: Accelerate the shift towards SCP, supporting regional and national policies and \ninitiatives. \n\u25ba Objective 4: Increase resource efficiency and decouple economic growth from \nenvironmental degradation and resource use, while creating decent job and economic \nopportunities and contributing to poverty eradication and shared prosperity. \n\u25ba Objective 5: Mainstream SCP into sustainable development policies, programmes and \nstrategies, as appropriate, including into poverty reduction strategies. \nThe 1018 - 2022strategy to implement the 10YFP (and support implementing SDG 12) defines a \ncommon vision, strategic principles and the following objectives:580 \n\u25ba Be an effective implementation mechanism for SDG 12, by monitoring trends, prioritising \nsupport to national policy implementation, as well as fostering awareness of SCP as an \nenabler for other SDGs. \n\u25ba Catalyse ambitious action by providing tools and solutions that support the shift to SCP. \n\u25ba Lead a cohesive implementation of SCP. \n\u25ba Demonstrate the impacts of SCP and its role in addressing key environmental and social \nchallenges. \nTerritorial scope:  Global. \nResources covered:  Not specified; all natural resources. \nSteps of the value chain covered:  All steps of the value chain. \nType of steering mechanism: The 10 YFP is a high-level UN statement with strategic priorities and \nguidance to enhance international cooperation, including through knowledge and experience sharing, \ncapacity building and facilitating access to technical and financial assistance for developing countries. \nThe One Planet Network is a multi-stakeholder partnership of 700+ members to implement the 10 YFP \ncommitment. It inclues national and local governments, civil society, businesses, scientific and \ntechnical organisations as well as international organisations. \nContent \nRelevant provisions: There are currently six programmes under the umbrella of 10YFP and, \nrespectively, the One Planet network.

Regionally, there are also cooperation mechanisms for SCP such as the Pan-European \nStrategic Framework for Greening the Economy (2030) or the Regional SCP Roadmap for Asia Pacific.  \nEvaluation and review: A mid-term review of the 10YFP\u2019s implementation was carried out in 2017.582 \nWithin the \u201c10YFP Indicators of Success Framework\u201d, the 10YFP indicators were linked to relevant \nSDG indicators. With regard to the 10YFP\u2019s Objective 4 (\u201cContribute to resource efficiency and \ndecoupling\u2026\u201d), the indicators include \u201cmaterial use reduction\u201d, \u201cwaste reduction\u201d, water use efficiency \nand energy use efficiency.583 \nReporting : The Secretariat annually reports to UN\u2019s High-level Political Forum (HLPF).584 Also, national \nfocal points are encouraged to report on national SCP policies and initiatives to the Secretariat, \nincluding in the context of carrying out a 10YFP global survey on national SCP policies and initiatives \n(publication envisaged fro 2017). Due to the fact that SDG 12.1 requests countries to \u201cImplement the \n10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (\u2026)\u201d and \ncountries are expected to report on SDG implementation, reporting on 10YFP implementation at the \nnational level will likely improve in the future; the review of SDG 12 implementation will be a focus in \n2018. \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: No respective procedures exist.  \nStakeholder and public involvement: Apart from governments and UN bodies, a high number of \u201cmajor \ngroups and other stakeholders\u201d are engaged in the 10YFP programmes (some 650 including \ngovernments and other stakeholder organizations).585 Presently, some 21 organisations are active in a \nleadership role within the six programmes and nearly 125 in \u201cmulti-stakeholder advisory committees\u201d \nto each of the programmes.586 Some of the stakeholder groups interact through regional Stakeholder \nFocal Points.  \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies:  Possible inconsistencies with WTO provisions \n(regarding public procurement, consumer policy etc.) do not seem to have been an issue so far, since \nthe 10YFP has focused on voluntary, information-based policy approaches.  \nPolitical weight of the instrument:  The 10YFP has some political weight due to its being developed over \na long time span within the UN\u2019s Rio process (including the Marrakesh process). Also, its topic of \nsustainable production and consumption has wide support also from civil society organizations. \nHowever, commitments with regard to sustainable consumption and production have been \ncontentious among governments for a long time, leading to a weak mandate for developing the 10YFP.  \nEffectiveness:  Having been adopted in 2012, the 10YFP has now been implemented for some years. \nPotentially, it can unfold impacts \u201cthrough multi-stakeholder programmes and partnerships, which \ndevelop, replicate and scale up SCP policies and initiatives at all levels\u201d; through \u201cfoster[ing] \nknowledge and experience sharing\u201d587 and, finally, through \u201cfacilitat[ing] access to technical and \nfinancial resources for developing countries.\u201d588 UN member states\u2019 reporting on SDG 12 (10YFP \n \n582 In included three elements; i) progress reporting, ii) independent external evaluation (Rouhban (2018)) and iii. and iii) a \nnew strategy for implementing the 10YFP 2018-2022 (One Planet (2018)). \n583 Main associated SDG indicators: 12.2.1; 12.5.1; 6.4.1; and 7.3.1, cf.

It is called to show more thorough evidence to \ngovernments, to the business community and to the general public that it is yielding \ntangible outcomes. \n\u25ba The 10YFP needs to be more active, organized and strategic in utilizing potential \nopportunities for mobilizing interest and support to it and developing common agendas \nwith donors, countries and development organizations. \n\u25ba The 10YFP must mobilize enough political will that will trigger more impetus. \n\u25ba The 10YFP must swiftly develop and pursue a strategy to engage the private sector, SMEs \nand industry. \n\u25ba The 10YFP is dramatically resource constrained. \n\u25ba Short and near-term objectives, namely strategic ones, with milestones, are not obvious.  \n\u25ba It seems desirable and opportune that an in-depth and comprehensive review of the Trust \nFund be made. This review should address the relevance of the Fund, its purposes, its \npossible replenishment and functioning.  \nIn terms of regional implementation, the SWITCH projects (e.g., SWITCH Asia, SWITCH Africa Green), \nfunded by the European Union, are considered a good practice example of addressing the sustainable \nuse of resources, improvement of resource efficiency and changes in consumption patterns. SWITCH \nAsia has been assessed by the UNEP Evaluation Office to be of high strategic relevance; and while \n\u201c[c]reating an enabling policy environment requires time\u201d it \u201cprovided notable contributions to raising \nawareness and understanding of SCP and that SCP has a presence on regional and sub-regional \nagendas\u201d.590 \nWith a view to the 10YFP\u2019s genesis, it has been recognised that agreeing (in 2002) on its development \nas such was an achievement, as was the reference (for the first time) of life-cycle analysis in an \napproved UN document.591 Still, the original mandate for developing a 10YFP has been criticised as \nvague, lacking stringent requirements as well as references to \u201cstrong\u201d sustainable consumption. NGOs \nhave been disappointed that it took 10 years to develop the actual 10YFP.592 In terms of the 10YFP\u2019s \nthematic focal areas, experts have recommended that the 10YFP should more systematically address \nthe \u201cbig points\u201d of sustainable consumption: food, mobility, and energy use/housing.593 \n \n589 Rouhban (2018). \n590 UNEP EOU (2017b), at para. 17. \n591 Fuchs and Lorek (2005). \n592 Barber (2010), at 1. \n593 Tukker et al.

In its simplest \nexpression, a green economy can be thought of as one which is low carbon, resource \nefficient and socially inclusive\u201d (own italics).595 After Rio+20, the initiative was updated to \u201cInclusive \nGreen Economy\u201d in order to emphasise the goals of equality and inclusiveness: \u201cIn its simplest \nexpression, such an economy is low carbon, efficient and clean in production, but also inclusive in \nconsumption and outcomes, based on sharing, circularity , collaboration, solidarity, resilience, \nopportunity, and interdependence\u201d (own italics).596 In a Green Economy, recycling minimises the need \nfor raw material extraction and goes along with considerable energy savings. By applying principles of \na \u201ccircular economy\u201d, the economy becomes \u201cregenerative and designed ab initio to eradicate waste \nand return nutrients and water to ecosystems\u201d.597 At the same time, sharing practices and models help \n \n594 One Planet (2018). \n595 IRP (2011), p. 2. \n596 UNEP (2015), p. 6. \n597 UNEP (2015), p. 22. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n153 to make the economy less resource intensive, \u201cas fewer products are produced to provide the same \nservice to more people.\u201d598  \nThe Green Economy agenda is interlinked with the Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG 8 \n(\u201cPromote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and \ndecent work for all\u201d). \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  The GEI is a non-binding UNEP initiative.  \nObjectives: To expand the community of sustainable practices, helping countries to develop their own \npolicies for a transformation to an inclusive green economy.  \nTerritorial scope:  The initiative is geared towards all UN Member States and explicitly provides \nassistance to developing countries. \nResources covered:  Abiotic as well as biotic resources. \nSteps of the value chain covered:  Resource extraction (including in natural resource sectors), \nmanufacturing, consumption, waste management (concept of \u201ccircular economy\u201d). \nType of steering mechanism:  technical assistance and capacity building; policy dialogue/ policy \nrecommendations and knowledge exchange  \nContent \nRelevant provisions/ guidelines for governments: The Green Economy Initiative is not about requiring \nspecific action or providing concrete guidelines to governments but more about diffusing a concept, \nproviding policy recommendations (e.g., on fiscal reforms), providing technical assistance and helping \nbuild capacities in partner countries with regard to their planning and implementation of a greener \nand more inclusive economic model. \nThe main elements of the GEI include: producing and disseminating the Green Economy Report (which \nanalysed the implications of implementing a green economy)599; coordinating \u2018The Economics of \nEcosystem Services and Biodiversity (TEEB) initiative600; providing country-specific advice on ways to \nmove towards a green economy (including identifying GE-related trade opportunities601); engagement \nof a range of researchers, NGOs, UN partners, organisations and businesses;602 provision of policy \nguidance, good practices, tools, and data via the Green Growth Knowledge Platform603 (established in \n2012 jointly by UNEP, OECD, World Bank and Global Green Growth Institute). \nDespite the fact that resource efficiency is an important component of the (Inclusive) Green Economy \nconcept, the technical assistance projects supported by UNEP and others which are featured on the \nGEI website seem to focus more on GE dimension such as maintaining ecosystem services604 \n \n598 UNEP (2015), p. 24. \n599 IRP (2011); see also UNEP (2012b). \n600 TEEB (2010). \n601 UNEP (2016b). \n602 UNEP (2010), at 5.  \n603 http://www.greengrowthknowledge.org/. \n604 E.g., the project \u201cAssisting Caribbean States' Sustainable Development through Green Economy\u201d (ACSSD-GE), \u201cGreening \nEconomies in the Eastern Neighborhoods: Organic Agriculture\u201d (EaP Green), and the Indonesia project in the \u201cGreen \nEconomy Joint Programme\u201d (GEJP) (links to all projects are provided at https://www.unenvironment.org/explore-\ntopics/green-economy/what-we-do/advisory-services.  \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n154 (agriculture, forestry, fisheries) or renewable energy production605.

Founded in \n2013, PAGE involves five UN agencies \u2013 UNEP (which also hosts the PAGE Secretariat and manages the \nPAGE Trust Fund), ILO, UNDP, UNIDO, and the UN Institute for Training and Research. PAGE has ten \n\u201caction partners\u201d,606 seven funding partners,607 and eleven \u201cPAGE countries\u201d which receive funding for \ntheir GE transitions. PAGE has its own institutional structure, including national steering \ncommittees,608 and a reporting mechanism.609 For our purpose, PAGE is interesting as it is currently \nthe most vibrant forum that follows up on the work of the Green Economy Initiative. \nEvaluation and review:  A terminal evaluation the GEI between 2012 and 2014 was carried out by \nUNEP\u2019s Evaluation Office in 2016 and published in early 2017610.  \nReporting: The GEI does not contain reporting obligations. However, SDG reporting on Goal 8 \n(\u201cPromote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and \ndecent work for all\u201d) will likely also include information on the activities and progress of UNEP\u2019s GEI. A \nfirst review of the implementation of SDG 8 is scheduled for 2019. \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: The GEI does not contain any \nsuch procedures.  \nStakeholder and public involvement:  While there is no official mechanism for the involvement of Major \nGroups and other stakeholders, the GEI does consult with research institutes, government \nrepresentatives, businesses, consumer groups, various experts, and civil society organisations. Among \nothers, the Green Economy Coalition (GEC),  a global network of organisations committed to \naccelerating a transition to a green inclusive economy, represents the voices of stakeholders in such \nconsultation processes.  \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: The GEI works together with the International \nResource Panel (and in the past with the Marrakesh Process) in creating sustainable policies. The IRP \n \n605 For instance, the Ghana project in the \u201cGreen Economy Joint Programme\u201d (GEJP). \n606 10YFP, Green Economy Coalition, Global Green Growth Institute, Green Growth Knowledge Platform, SWITCH Africa \nGreen, SWITCH Asia, UN Environment Finance Initiative, UN Environment Inquiry, UN-REDD Programme, UNDP-UNEP \nPoverty-Environment Initiative. \n607 The EU, various European governments and the Republic of Korea. \n608 http://www.un-page.org/about/governance. \n609 http://www.un-page.org/about/annual-report.  \n610 UNEP EOU (2017a). \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n155 assesses the causes of the problems, while GEI proposes practical solutions and develops economic \npolicies.611  \nPolitical weight of the instrument: As an initiative driven by a single UN agency with few financial \nmeans (US-$ 16,9 mio)612, the political weight of the GEI can be described as medium. \nEffectiveness:  UNEP\u2019s Evaluation Office considers the \u201cGreen Economy Initiative (GEI) (\u2026) one of UN \nEnvironment's most visible contributions to the global environmental debate during the past \ndecade\u201d.613 At least two strands of the GEI have had significant effects on the international policy \ndiscourse and on policy-making: UNEP\u2019s Green Economy Report of 2011 decisively influenced the \nRio+20 agenda, and also contributed to filling significant knowledge gaps regarding green growth.614 \nSimilarly, the TEEB Initiative which formed part of the GEI unfolded great influence on the \ninternational discourse on nature protection and land use, and subsequently led to policy adjustments \nin various countries;615 however, these are of little relevance for the efficient use of abiotic resources. \nAs regards Green Economy policies in developing countries, UNEP reports a set of success stories,616 \nthough not all of these successes can be directly attributed to the GEI. Thus far, 65 countries have \ncommitted to working towards an inclusive green economy within UNEP\u2019s framework.  \nUNEP\u2019s Terminal Evaluation reaches the following conclusion: \u2018The project managed to bring the \nconcept of Green Economy to the international development debate, while assisting dozens of \ncountries in their initial efforts to transition to more resource efficiency, sustainable consumption and \nproduction. The project\u2019s innovative character, the high relevance of the concept of Green Economy, \nownership by many countries and collaboration with key international organizations, effective \nmobilization of funds for the umbrella project, and the overall efficient project delivery are the main \nreasons for the success of the project in producing its different outputs and outcomes. On the other \nhand, factors which resulted in the incomplete achievement of outcomes at a national level, and \nmoderate likelihood of final impact include: the lack of UN Environment's country presence, its high \nstaff turnover, changes in national governments (including focal points for UN Environment work), \npolitical and economic inertia and opposition to change, incomplete stakeholder involvement, and \ninsufficient funds at national level for investment to implement GE recommendations. The overall \nperformance of the GE Project is rated as 'satisfactory', considering its high relevance, its effective \nachievement of outputs, the full achievement of outcomes at global level and a partial achievement at \nnational level, a moderate likelihood of impact, good sustainability, and high operative and cost \nefficiency in spite of several operative and administrative challenges\u201d.617 This assessment is rather \nsobering, pointing to national-level \u2018opposition to change\u2019 towards a greener (more resource efficient) \neconomy.  \nIn terms of regional implementation, the UN Economic Commission for Europe (Eighth Environment \nfor Europe Ministerial Conference) in 2016 endorsed a Pan-European Strategic Framework for \nGreening the Economy which defines some focus areas relevant for resource efficiency618 and \n \n611 An overview of the synergies between these three bodies can be found here: \nhttp://www.unep.fr/scp/marrakech/publications/pdf/Background%20Paper%20RP%20Steering%20Committee.pdf. \n612 UNEP EOU (2017a). \n613 UNEP EOU (2017a), at para. 1. \n614 Barbier (2012). \n615 The core recommendations of TEEB have been taken up, among others, within the CBD, UNEP, FAO, World Bank, the \nRio+20 Conference, the UN Sustainable Development Goals as well as within many nation states and the EU (see, for \ninstance, Action 5 of the EU Biodiversity Strategy, 2011) see also Braat and Groot (2012); Hedden-Dunkhorst et al.

However, no date is set for the \nnext PAGE Ministerial Conference. \nA related opportunity (though not strictly tied to the GEI) is the 5th Meeting of the UN Environment \nAssembly (UNEA-3) in February 2021 in Nairobi. \nA \u2018good practice\u2019 aspect of UNEP\u2019S Green Economy Initiative is its flexible character as an umbrella \nproject which included 16 individual projects and whose more general project activities were financed \non the basis if relatively unrestricted funds. Some of the Initiative\u2019s sub-projects later became \nindependent. These include the Partnership for Action on the Green Economy (PAGE) and the Green \nGrowth Knowledge Platform. \n \n2.2.6 UNEP Global Initiative for Resource Efficient Cities  \nTable 20:  UNEP Global Initiative for Resource Efficient Cities (launched: 06/2012) \nKey aspects  Summary  \nForm and legal status legally non-binding UNEP initiative \nObjectives help cities scale up global resource efficiency initiative goals \nAdressees cities \nTerritorial scope global  \nResources covered building materials, energy, water, land, waste & biotic resources: such as \nfood etc. \nStage of the value chain  building construction, consumption, waste management (not so strongly \ncovered: material extraction) \nSteering mechanisms pilot projects, knowledge diffusion & capacity building, networking & \nlearning \nPolitical weight +  \n(not much visibility or funding) \nRelevance for RE +++ \nSummary \nThe Global Initiative for Resource Efficient Cities (GI-REC) was launched at Rio+20 (2012) and seeks to \nhelp cities to scale up global resource efficiency goals.620 It defines a \u201cresource-efficient city\u201d as \u201ca city \nthat is significantly decoupled from resource exploitation and ecological impact and is socio-\neconomically and ecologically sustainable in the long-term\u201d.621 Cities are treated as important sites for \n \n619 ECE/BATUMI.CONF/2016/13.

It also aims at \n\u201c(\u2026) enhancing the quality of life in urban areas, in particular in rapidly growing cities in emerging and \ndeveloping countries, by minimizing resource extraction, energy consumption, and waste generation \nthrough safeguarding ecosystem services and decoupling city development from resource use and \nenvironmental impacts.\u201d625 \nTerritorial scope:  Global. \nResources covered:  Mostly those resources that are being used or managed within cities (related to the \nenergy, water, manufacturing and waste sectors; not so much related to the extraction of raw \nmaterials). \nSteps of the value chain covered:  Production, consumption, waste management; less so: resource \nextraction (which typically takes place outside cities). \nType of steering mechanism: Capacity building, technology and support in the form of networks. \nContent \nRelevant provisions/ guidelines for governments: The initiative does not specify any binding standards \nfor its addressees, but rather provides:  \n\u25ba demonstration projects in pilot cities \n\u25ba recommendations to guide city-level resource efficiency improvements626 \n\u25ba knowledge \u201cto improve efficiency of processes and use of resources within and across value \nchains, taking a Life-Cycle approach\u201d627, including assisting cities in identifying and monitoring \ntheir resource footprint \n\u25ba a platform to \u201cexchange experiences, share best practices, and establish a peer-review process \nacross cities for further improving access to resources and their efficient use\u201d628 \n \n622 UNEP (2017c), at 2. \n623 http://energies2050.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/7_Cities-and-Climate-Change_GIL.pdf. \n624 http://www.resourceefficientcities.org/about-2/. \n625 UNEP and GI-REC (2012), at 2. \n626 UNEP (2012a). \n627 http://www.resourceefficientcities.org/about-2/. \n628 http://www.resourceefficientcities.org/about-2/.  \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n158 Institutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : The initiative is part of UNEP\u2019s Resource Efficiency (RE) sub-programme which is housed \nin UNEP\u2019s Division of Technology, Industry and Economics (DTIE, Paris), and includes cooperation \nwith a range of external institutional partners.629 \nEvaluation and review: While the initiative helps cities to self-monitor their ecological footprint, no \nevaluation or review process has been produced630 or seems to be foreseen for the initiative itself.  \nReporting: There is no reporting mechanism provided in the GI-REC. \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: The said procedures are not part \nof the GI-REC.  \nStakeholder and public involvement:  Cities, city networks, NGOs and businesses organisations, national \ngovernments and international organisations have been involved in the GI-REC. \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: As the GI-REC seeks to help cities implement \nmeasures on the local level to achieve global resource efficiency goals, it is in line with the SDGs. The \ninitiative is not known to countervail other treaties or policies. Rather, it is related to the \u201cIntegrated \nEnvironmental Planning\u201d initiative (UNEP & Cities Alliance), the \u201cSustainable Buildings and Climate \nInitiative\u201d (SBCI), a partnership between the UN and the building sector (since 2006) and UNEP\u2019s \nSustainable Social Housing Initiative (SUSHI) which aims at improving sustainability in social housing \nprogrammes. In 2013, a report by the International Resource Panel explored the question of city-level \ndecoupling.631 \nAssessment \nPolitical weight of the instrument: The initiative is largely driven by a single UN agency (with a range of \nexternal partners). It has few financial means and low visibility (for instance, it is not referred to in the \nUN New Urban Agenda). Overall, its political weight seems to be low.  \nEffectiveness:  There is very little literature to be found on the success of the initiative. UNEP itself \njudges that \u201cthere is little consensus on a framework definition of resource efficiency; [there is a] need \nto develop effective tools and methods to better assess resource flows at the city level; [and] the \nbusiness case for investment on resource efficiency still needs to be made, and practical advice rooted \nin accessible knowledge from peers is necessary to accompany a shift to greater resource efficiency at \ncity level\u201d.632 This assessment implies that a direct impact of UNEP\u2019s initiative on resource efficiency in \ncities is rather low. \nWithin the initiative, a 2014 global survey of cities\u2019 resource efficiency initiatives was carried out and \nfound that main drivers to actively manage resources at local level are climate change, population \ngrowth and rising prices of resources. Main factors for implementing resource optimizing strategies \nwere improvement in city competitiveness, better management of the environment, and improvement \n \n629 Among others, UN Habitat, the countries Brazil, France, Japan and the US; pilot and partner cities (NYC, Bangkok, Manila, \nSao Paolo), city networks (ICLEI, Cities Alliance, World Council for City Data); the China-ASEAN Environmental Cooperation \nCenter (CAEC), the GIZ, NGOs (IIED, Energies 2050, International Federation of Consulting Engineers), the private sector \n(World Business Council on Sustainable Development, EcoCity Builders), and research orgnaisations (World Resources \nInstitute, Sustainability Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology).

The support that cities need to improve resource efficiency was access to capacity \nbuilding programmes, communication campaigns and access to networks of technical expertise, e.g. \nregarding \u201csmart city\u201d technologies.633 \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: In the context of implementing SDG-11, the Global \nInitiative on Resource-Efficient Cities could support cities in setting their own goals for resource \nefficiency. From the GI-REC\u2019s website it does not become clear what its role is with regard to the SDG \nimplementation process.  \n \n2.2.7 UNEP International Resource Panel (2007) \nTable 21:  UNEP International Resource Panel (adoption: 2007) \nKey aspects  Summary  \nForm and legal status Independent scientific panel, established under auspices of UNEP \nObjectives to provide independent scientific assessments and policy advice on resource \nmanagement, decoupling growth and resource use \nParties 36 scientists from different world regions \nTerritorial scope global \nResources covered abiotic resources (metals, others), biotic resources \nStage of the value chain  holistic: extraction, production, consumption, recycling, waste management \nSteering mechanisms science-policy interface: knowledge production, information dissemination, \npolicy advice \nPolitical weight ++  \n(renown indep. scientists; advised G7 on concrete resource efficiency \npolicies) \nRelevance for RE +++ \nSummary \nThe International Resource Panel (IRP) was launched by the United Nations Environment Programme \n(UNEP) in 2007 to create a platform for the sharing of knowledge on resource use worldwide.634 The \nPanel offers independent scientific advice on sustainable resource management. Scientists present \nlatest findings on scientific, technical and socio-economic aspects of resource use and offer advice to \nstakeholders. The Panel thus aims to connect experts, policymakers, industry representatives and civil \nsociety.  \nThe Panel promotes a holistic approach to resource management. It has published a number of high-\nprofile reports, among others on decoupling (including at the level of cities), global metal flows, \nenvironmental impacts of resource use, and cross-cutting issues such as trade. \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  Independent scientific panel under the auspices of UNEP. \n \n633 UNEP (2014). \n634 Its establishment followed the criteria and guidelines for partnerships decided by the United Nations Commission for \nSustainable Development (CSD-11) in 2003. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n160 Objectives: The objectives of the International Resource Panel include to: \n\u25ba Prepare independent, coherent and authoritative scientific studies and assessments of policy \nrelevance on the sustainable use and management of natural resources and in particular their \nenvironmental impacts over the full life cycle; \n\u25ba Inform international policy discourse and development on emerging challenges and opportunities \nfor the sustainable use and management of and equitable access to natural resources.635 \nThe Panel\u2019s efforts to reach these objectives are guided by the principles of policy relevance, \nindependence, inclusiveness, objectivity and integrity.636 \nTerritorial scope:  Global. \nResources covered:  Non-biotic resources (including minerals, metals, water, land and soils) and biotic \nresources (forestry, biofuels, food). \nSteps of the value chain covered:  Extraction, production, consumption, recycling, waste management. \nType of steering mechanism: Knowledge production, information dissemination.  \nContent \nRelevant provisions/ guidelines for governments: Based on its scientific assessments, the IRP provides \npolicy advice which governments are free to take-up in their policies. The Panel\u2019s assessments relate \nto decoupling and resource efficiency, cities, water, metals, land and soils, food, trade, green \ntechnology and global materials flows. Specifically on resource efficiency, the IRP published a report \non potentials and economic implications637 as well as an input for the G20 Resource Efficiency \nDialogue638 in 2017. The latter report underlined, among others, the connections betwen climate and \nresources, and presented good practices with regard to resource efficiency policies. Its most recent \nassessment \u2013 the Global Resources Outlook 2019 \u2013 emphasizes that \u201cResource efficiency alone (\u2026) is \nnot enough. What is needed is a move from linear to circular flows through a combination of extended \nproduct life cycles, intelligent product design and standardization and reuse, recycling and \nremanufacturing\u201d639. The Global Resources Outlook also refers to the concept of a \"safe operating \nspace\" which is to limit natural resource use.640 In its 2019 report on minerals governance, the IRP \noutlines its view on a model for mineral resource governance for sustainable development. While it \nalso recognises the \u201cabsolute necessity\u201d to decouple economic growth from negative environmental \nand social impacts, remains quite vague with regard to concrete governance options. Its concept of a \n\u201csustainable development licence to operate\u201d appears to be a catch-all call for addressing the well-\nknown challenges, and the suggested policy framework identifies \u201cwhat\u201d to achieve, but does not \naddress \u201chow\u201d.641 A further IRP report scheduled for 2020 is to address the interlinkages between \nresource efficiency and climate change strategies.642 \n \n635 Para. 3, http://www.resourcepanel.org/policies-and-procedures-irp.  \n636 Ibid, para. 4. \n637 IRP (2017b). \n638 IRP (2017a). \n639 IRP (2019), at 29. \n640 IRP (2019), at 65. \n641 Bodle et al (2020), at 365. \n642 The full report \"Resource Efficiency and Climate Change\" is planned for the end of 2020.

It is supported \nby a Secretariat hosted in UNEP\u2019s Paris Office. The IRP\u2019s Steering Committee includes over 25 \ngovernments from developed and developing countries, the European Commission, OECD, UNEP, civil \nsociety and business organisations (IUCN, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development \nWBCSD, the International Council for Science ICSU, the International Chamber of Commerce ICC). \nWithin the IRP, Working Groups are built to produce assessment reports which are then considered \nand approved by the Panel as such. A set of \u201cPolicies and Procedures\u201d643 governs the working of the \nInternational Resource Panel. Among others, Steering Committee and Panel members are required to \nensure that multiple points of view are considered in the preparation of assessments. \nThe IRP convenes biannual meetings to review progress of work, review and approve drafts of \nscientific studies and assessments, as well as discuss and agree on IRP strategic and operational issues \nEvaluation and review: The IRP was evaluated by UNEP\u2019s Evaluation Office in 2016.644  \nReporting: n.a. \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: n.a. \nStakeholder and public involvement: The Panel as such consists of 40 scientists, the Steering Committee \ninvolves governments, the European Commission, and UN Environment. While various business \norganisations are involved as strategic partners, environmental or other civil society organisations are \nless well represended as strategic partners or elsewhere in the institutional structure. \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: IRP assessments  build on and complement \nother international initiatives including the Marrakech Process, the Kobe 3R Action Plan and the \n10YPF.  \nPolitical weight of the instrument: The IRP offers an independent source of global assessments and \nadvice intended to be used in policy-making. Its policy influence could be greater if it was linked to an \ninternational agreement whose conference of parties it would advise, the way the International Panel \non Climate Change (IPCC) is linked to the UN Convention on Climate Change or the Intergovernmental \nScience-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is linked to the UN \nConvention on Biological Diversity.  \nEffectiveness:  The IRP has rapidly become an authoritative voice on sustainable resource management. \nThe figures published in IRP reports are widely quoted, and its assessments have frequently been \nreceived with high interest in the international policy community. The G7 asked the IRP to support its \nwork on resource efficiency, indicating its legitimacy among governmental policy-makers. To what \nextent governments will actually implement the Panel\u2019s recommendations remains to be seen. To date, \nthe policy advice of the IRP has largely been limited to national resource policy while \nrecommendations for international -level resource policies have hardly been published. \nThe independent evaluation by UNEP\u2019s Evaluation Office concludes: \u201cThe work of the IRP continues to \naddress the needs and topics for which it was created. The need for this work is greater than ever and \nappetite for information about the policy needs and options is likely growing with the increased \nawareness of sustainability issues and the SDGs. 204. The IRP has exceeded targets for the main \nclasses of outputs: assessment reports and communications. The IRP has been generating assessment \nreports at a pace of one per quarter since 2010.

The vision includes a reference to the goal of \u2018promot[ing] the \n \n650 World Bank (2016d), at 3. \n651 I.e., where the Bank\u2019s Operational Policy (OP) 10.00 (on Investment Project Financing) and the accompanying Bank \nProcedure (BP 10.00) applies. \n652 World Bank (2016d), at 3. \n653 World Bank (2016d), at ix. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n164 efficient and equitable use of natural resources\u2019 within the parameters of Bank-financed \nprojects. \n\u25ba The Bank\u2019s \u201cEnvironmental and Social Policy for Investment Project Financing\u201d  sets \nout the mandatory requirements that the Bank itself must follow regarding projects it \nsupports through Investment Project Financing. \n\u25ba The ten \u201cEnvironmental and Social Standards\u201d  (ESS) which, together with the ESS\u2019s \nAnnexes, set out the mandatory requirements that apply to borrowers and projects \nsupported by Investment Project Financing. With regard to resource efficiency (and \nresource extraction), the following ESSs are particularly relevant: \n1. ESS-1 on \u201cAssessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and \nImpacts\u201d requires borrowers to assess, manage and monitor environmental and social \nrisks and impacts along the project lifecycle. ESS-1 also requires a \u2018mitigation hierarchy \n\u2018approach that includes anticipating, avoiding, minimizing (where unavoidable) risks \nand impacts and compensating/ offsetting significant residual impacts. Stakeholders \nneed to be engaged in the environmental and social assessment of the project proposal. \nAssessments are required to cover all relevant direct, indirect and cumulative \nenvironmental and social risks and impacts throughout the project life cycle. While \nimpacts from the consumption of abiotic resource could potentially count as direct \nimpacts (attributable to the project), indirect impacts (caused by project but later in \ntime/farther away) or as cumulative impacts,654 resource consumption does not fall \nunder the environmental risks explicitly mentioned to be covered.  \n2. ESS-3 on \u201cResource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention and Management\u201d aims, among \nothers, to promote the sustainable use of resources, including raw materials. \nBorrowers are required to \u2018implement technically and financially feasible measures for \nimproving efficient consumption of energy, water and raw materials, as well as other \nresources\u2019, integrating \u2018the principles of cleaner production into product design and \nproduction processes to conserve the said resources\u2019. Where benchmarking data are \navailable, the borrower is required to make a comparison to establish the relative level \nof efficiency.655 Finally, to the extent technically and financially feasible, the borrower is \nto adopt measures specified in the World Bank Group\u2019s \u201cEnvironmental, Health and \nSafety Guidelines\u201d (EHSG) and other \u201cGood International Industry Practice\u201d (GIIP) to \nsupport efficient use of raw materials.656 \n3. ESS-5 on \u201cLand Acquisition, Restrictions on Land Use and Involuntary Resettlement\u201d \naddresses resettlements that sometimes go along with resource extraction. \nThe Bank requires borrowers to conduct an environmental and social assessment of projects \nproposed for Bank support in accordance with ESS1, and to prepare and implement projects so \nthat they meet the requirements of all ESSs.657 To increase country ownership, the borrower\u2019s \ninitial assessment, development and implementation of the project can follow their own domestic \nEnvironmental and Social Frameworks.658 The Bank classifies projects into four classifications \n(high, substantial, moderate or low risk)659 and aligns their own due diligence and their \nrequirements vis-\u00e0-vis borrowers to the respective risk categories. For instance, the Bank\u2019s due \ndiligence for high or substantial risk projects includes site visits by an environmental or social \n \n654 These are defined as \u2018result[ing] from individually minor but collectively significant activities taking place over a period of \ntime\u2019 World Bank (2016d), at 16. \n655 World Bank (2016d), at 40. \n656 Ibid. \n657 World Bank (2016d), at 6. \n658 World Bank (2016d), at 6. \n659 Taking into account, among others, the type, location, sensitivity, and scale of the project; the nature and magnitude of the \npotential environmental and social risks and impacts; and the capacity and commitment of the Borrower. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n165 specialist who provides advice, guidance and clearance during project preparation, and possibly \nalso during implementation.660 \n\u25ba The Bank Directive \u201cEnvironmental and Social Directive for Investment Project \nFinancing\u201c  sets out the mandatory requirements for the implementation of the \nEnvironmental and Social Policy for Investment Project Financing (IPF), applicable to the \nbank. Notably, this includes the due diligence process that the World Bank needs to follow \nfor each project proposal. \n\u25ba The Bank Directive on \u201cAddressing Risks and Impacts on Disadvantaged or Vulnerable \nIndividuals or Groups\u201d  defines provisions for Bank staff regarding due diligence \nobligations relating to the identification of, and mitigation of risks and impacts on, \nindividuals or groups who, because of their particular circumstances, may be \ndisadvantaged or vulnerable. \nFinally, non-mandatory Guidance Notes for Borrowers  support borrowers in implementing the \nSafeguards.661 The Guidance Note on ESS 3 (resource efficiency)662 specifies that the Borrower \u201cwill \nimplement technically and financially feasible measures for improving efficient consumption of \nenergy, water and raw materials, as well as other resources. Such measures will integrate the \nprinciples of cleaner production into product design and production processes to conserve raw \nmaterials, energy and water, as well as other resources. Where benchmarking data are available, the \nBorrower will make a comparison to establish the relative level of efficiency.\u201d \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : The World Bank\u2019s Board of Executive Directors initiated (in 2012) and approved (in 2016) \nthe revision of the ESF. On a strategic level, the Bank\u2019s Committee on Development Effectiveness \n(which oversees policy matters) is responsible for the ESF. Its operational implementation lies with \nthe Bank\u2019s project staff who supervise project implementation. The Internal Audit Vice Presidency \n(IAD) is an assurance and consulting activity focused on evaluating the effectiveness of governance, \nrisk management, and control processes in the World Bank Group. The World Bank Group\u2019s \nIndependent Evaluation Group (IEG), which operates independently of the Bank\u2019s management carries \nout (\u201cexternal\u201d) evaluations across the World Bank Group, reporting directly to the Board of Executive \nDirectors. Both IAD and IEG can potentially review the ESF\u2019s implementation and effectiveness.  \nRegional Development Banks are independent of the World Bank and its ESF but have traditionally \nbeen oriented towards the World Bank safeguards. \nEvaluation and review: The (Bank-internal) \u201cEnvironmental and Social Policy for Investment Project \nFinancing\u201d will be reviewed on an ongoing basis and be adjusted as appropriate, subject to approval by \nthe Board of Directors. For the ESS, no evaluation and review mechanisms are specified; the last set of \nsafeguards had persisted for some 20 years, before a critical IEG report led to their revision. \nReporting: There are no reporting obligations related to the implementation of the ESF. However, the \nESF itself commits the World Bank to monitor the environmental and social performance of an IPF-\nfunded project on an ongoing basis, in accordance with the requirements of the legal agreement \nbetween the borrower and the Bank which defines the project and specifies an \u201cEnvironmental and \n \n660 World Bank (2016b), para. 39. \n661 See all Guidance Notes at https://www.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/environmental-and-social-\nframework/brief/environmental-and-social-framework-resources. \n662 World Bank (2018). \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n166 Social Commitment Plan\u201d (ESCP). The mode and intensity of monitoring are determined by the \npotential environmental and social risks and impacts of the project.663 At the same time, the borrower \nis obliged to conduct monitoring (and submit reports) on the environmental and social performance of \nthe project against the ESSs. The Bank reviews these monitoring reports. \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: The extent of monitoring is \nrelated to the level of the diagnosed potential environmental and social risks and impacts of the \nproject.664 Monitoring is based on the review of the borrower\u2019s monitoring reports, potentially on \nmonitoring site visits665 and, \u201cwhere appropriate\u201d, on information from stakeholders involved to \ncomplement or verify the monitoring reports.666 Based on these insights, the Bank identifies and \nagrees with the borrower corrective or preventive measures and actions which will be included in the \nESCP. When corrective or preventive measures and actions are not implemented as agreed between \nthe Bank and the borrower, the Bank can apply remedies.667  \nThere exists a four-tiered grievance mechanism: project affected parties can avail themselves of \nproject grievance mechanisms, local grievance mechanisms, the Bank\u2019s corporate Grievance Redress \nService or, finally, to the World Bank\u2019s independent Inspection Panel in order to determine whether \nharm has occurred as a direct result of World Bank non-compliance with its policies and \nprocedures.668 In 2016, seven complaints were filed with the Inspection Panel.669 None of these was \nconcerned with resource efficiency. Potentially, a project that is highly inefficient in its use of \nresources could be object of a complaint. However, most environmentally motivated complaints seem \nto address the immediate damages to ecosystems through infrastructure projects, and to the related \nimpacts on public health or livelihoods. A report listing the major policy issues raised in cases at World \nBank Inspection Panel does not mention resource efficiency among the most relevant eleven issues.670 \nStakeholder and public involvement:  ESS-10 on \u201cStakeholder Engagement and Information Disclosure\u201d \nrequires engagement as an inclusive process conducted throughout the project, targeting both project-\naffected parties and other interested parties. The process is to involve: (i) stakeholder identification \nand analysis; (ii) planning how the engagement with stakeholders will take place; (iii) disclosure of \ninformation; (iv) consultation with stakeholders; (v) addressing and responding to grievances; and \n(vi) reporting to stakeholders. Where appropriate, the Bank can require the borrower to engage \nstakeholders and third parties (e.g., NGOs, independent experts, local communities) to complement or \nverify project monitoring information. Where Indigenous Peoples are present in, or have a collective \nattachment to, the proposed project area, ESS7 requires the borrower to tailor meaningful \nconsultation to Indigenous Peoples and, in specific circumstances, to obtain the Free, Prior and \nInformed Consent (FPIC) of the affected Indigenous Peoples. \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: The ESF refers to other international norms. \nFor instance, the \u201cVision\u201d claims that \u201cthe World Bank\u2019s activities support the realization of human \nrights expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\u201d671 but NGOs criticise that human rights \n \n663 World Bank (2016d), at 10. \n664 World Bank (2016d), at 10. \n665 World Bank (2016b), para. 63b. \n666 World Bank (2016d). \n667 These remedies are set out in the Bank\u2019s Operational Policy (OP) 10.00. \n668 World Bank (2016d), at x. \n669 World Bank (2016a), at 54. \n670 World Bank (2016c), at 28. \n671 World Bank (2016d), at 1. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n167 language is limited to the Vision Statement672 and that references to sexual orientation or gender \nidentity \u2013 upholding human rights among others for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer \n(LGBTQ) people \u2013 had been removed from the new policy.673 ESS1 demands that borrowers \u201censure \nthat the environmental and social assessment takes into account in an appropriate manner all issues \nrelevant to the project, including (\u2026) the country\u2019s applicable policy framework, national laws and \nregulations, (\u2026) and obligations of the country directly applicable to the project under relevant \ninternational treaties and agreements\u201d.674 Borrowers are explicitly required to comply with \ninternational law relating to the manufacture, trade and use of chemicals and hazardous materials \nincluding pesticide products and hazardous wastes (e.g. the Basel and the Rotterdam Conventions and \ntheir protocols).675 ESS2 on labour and working conditions only partly draws on ILO\u2019s core labour \nstandards and not all of them are taken up. Finally, the ESF is harmonized to a significant extent with \nthe IFC\u2019s performance standards (see below). \nPolitical weight of the instrument: The political weight of the ESF and particularly the Environmental \nand Social Standards for borrowers is high. With the poor environmental and social record of many \nWorld Bank financed projects in the past decades, the requirements of the ESF and their effective \nimplementation have become a centrepiece of the political dispute between the World Bank Group and \nits (civil society) critics. Accordingly, the update of the ESF took four years and required more public \nconsultations than originally scheduled. \nEffectiveness:  Effectiveness cannot be empirically assessed as the new ESF hat not been in force long \nenough. Theoretically, the ESF can support the enforcement of both international and national \nenvironmental norms, including those on resource efficiency. This is due to the above mentioned \nrequirement that borrowers \u201censure that the environmental and social assessment takes into account \n(\u2026) the country\u2019s applicable policy framework (\u2026) and obligations of the country directly applicable to \nthe project under relevant international treaties and agreements\u201d.676 In addition, the ESF\u2019s provision \non using and strengthening a borrower\u2019s \u201cenvironmental and social framework\u201d \u2013 i.e., its relevant \npolicies, legislation and institutions677 \u2013 implies that this framework is assessed by the Bank. In case an \nassessment concludes that the respective framework will not enable the project to achieve objectives \nmaterially consistent with the ESSs, the Bank is required to work with the borrower to identify and \nagree on measures and actions to strengthen the framework678 \u2013 and hence its national policies, \nincluding with regard to resource efficiency.  \nIn practice, the relatively vaue language of ESS3 and the Guidance Notes on ESS3 (which limit the \nresource efficiency requirement to \u201ctechnically and financially feasible measures\u201c leave much room of \nmanoever if a borrower is not ambitious with regard to resource efficiency or has not go the required \nimplementation capacities. In addition, the worth of the ESF will critically depend on the Bank carrying \nout realistic risk assessments and safeguards ratings, as well as effective monitoring, evaluation, \ncapacity-building for borrowers and enforcement of the safeguards. Project monitoring still relies \nlargely on reports by borrowers, not on independent third-party information. After the focus of the \nprevious Safeguard Policies was on ex ante assessments, more skills will now be required for \nmonitoring and mitigation. Both presuppose a high level of policy as well as technical skills within the \n \n672 Ulu Foundation et al. (2016). \n673 https://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2016/09/world-bank-approves-new-diluted-safeguards/. \n674 World Bank (2016d), at 19. \n675 World Bank (2016d), at 41-42. \n676 World Bank (2016d), at 7, 19. \n677 A borrower\u2019s \u201cenvironmental and social framework\u201d includes those aspects of a country\u2019s \u201cpolicy, legal and institutional \nframework, including its national, subnational, or sectoral implementing institutions and applicable laws, regulations, rules \nand procedures, and implementation capacity, which are relevant to the environmental and social risks and impacts of the \nproject\u201d World Bank (2016d), at 7. \n678 Ibid. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n168 Bank and respective investments in staff capacities. While it has been recognised that the Bank has \nstarted moving from a prescriptive safeguards approach to a focus on capacity building of \nborrowers,679 the use of borrowers existing environmental and social frameworks in the assessment, \ndevelopment and implementation of projects is a major point of concern: many civil society \norganisations see it as a means of diluting the safeguard system.680 \nDespite critique of possible implementation deficits, the positive potential of the World Bank \nSafeguards is often recognised. Taking this potential into account, it has been severely criticised that \nthe ESF\u2019s scope of application does not extend beyond project financing to more programmatic loans \n(DPL, P4R). These make up a significant share of total Bank funding and can have substantial and long-\nterm sustainability impacts.681 \nSpecifically with regard to extracting non-renewable raw materials and mining projects, civil society \norganisations have questioned whether the World Bank should at all fund such activities. With \nsufficiently high raw material prices the use of public subsidies would not be justified, especially \nconsidering the often dramatically negative environmental and social impacts on local communities \nand production countries.682  \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: With the ESS being implemented only since 2018, it \nis highly unlikely that they will be opened for revisions during the next years. It therefore seems \nunrealistic to be able strengthen the requirements on assessing resource consumption related risks \nand impacts in ESS-1 or the borrower requirements in ESS-3. The Standard requires borrowers to \n\u201cimplement technically and financially feasible measures for improving efficient consumption of (...) \nresources\u201d; a future revision could give a wide interpretation of what is \u201cfinancially feasible\u201d and \npossibly define scenarios where expected severe resource consumption impacts could lead to a non-\napproval of the project. Changes in the Bank\u2019s internal \u201cEnvironmental and Social Policy for \nInvestment Project Financing\u201d, including its Operational Policy 10.00, are more easily feasible and can \npossibly promote such ideas.  \nGood practice aspects of the World Bank Safeguards are their bindingness both vis-\u00e0-vis borrowers \nand the World Bank itself; the need to obtain (although in a limited set of circumstances) Free, Prior \nand Informed Consent (FPIC) of affected Indigenous Peoples; the (new) provision that borrowers \nengage stakeholders and third parties \u201cto complement or verify project monitoring information\u201d \n(although it is restricted by the qualifier \u201cwhere appropriate\u201d); and the relatively elaborate system of \ngrievance mechanisms. \n \n679 Netherlands (2015), at 27. \n680 e.g., V\u00f6cking (2014). \n681 e.g., BIC & Global Witness (2013). \n682 Cf. contribution of J\u00fcrgen Maier, Forum Umwelt & Entwicklung, at a public discussion, https://www.die-\ngdi.de/veranstaltungen/konsultation-zur-neuen-umwelt-strategie-der-weltbank-gruppe/.

The Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability are \nembedded in the IFC\u2019s Sustainability Framework. The standards are directed towards private sector \nclients, providing guidance on how to identify, avoid, mitigate, and manage risks and impacts, \nincluding through stakeholder engagement and disclosure obligations. Performance Standard (PS) 3 \naddresses resource efficiency. \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  Internal strategic guidelines of the IFC as a multilateral governmental \norganisation, made binding as lending conditions on its clients.  \nObjectives:  The objective underlying the Performance Standards is that IFC clients \u201cmanage \nenvironmental and social risks and impacts so that development opportunities are enhanced.\u201d683  \nTerritorial scope:  Global. \nResources covered:  All. \nSteps of the value chain covered:  All (resource extraction, production, consumption, waste \nmanagement). \nType of steering mechanism: Vis-\u00e0-vis clients, the Performance Standards are an incentive based \nmechanism \u2013 a project is funded only when compliance with them is contractually agreed with. \n \n683 IFC (2012), at 1. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n170 Content \nRelevant provisions/ guidelines for governments: The IFC\u2019s Sustainability Framework was originally \nadopted in 2006 and has been updated in 2012 following a highly critical evaluation684 and an 18-\nmonth consultation process with stakeholders around the world. It consists of three elements: \n\u25ba The Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability  defines IFC\u2019s own sustainability \ncommitments.  \n\u25ba The Performance Standards  define clients\u2019 responsibilities for managing their \nenvironmental and social risks. In particular, PS-1 and PS-3 are relevant for our purpose: \n1. PS-1 governs the \u201cAssessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and \nImpacts\u201d. Among others, it requires clients to identify and evaluate environmental and \nsocial risks and impacts of the project; to adopt a mitigation hierarchy to anticipate and \navoid, or where avoidance is not possible, minimize, and, where residual impacts \nremain, compensate/offset for risks and impacts to the environment, but also to \nworkers and affected communities; to use environmental and social management \nsystems; and to ensure that grievances from stakeholders are managed appropriately. \n2. PS-3 addresses \u201cResource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention\u201d. Whether or not PS3 is \napplicable is established during the earlier environmental, social risks and impacts \nidentification process of PS-1. Performance Standard 3 requires clients to implement \n\u201ctechnically and financially feasible and cost effective measures\u201d for improving \nresource efficiency, including with regard to material inputs (para.6, PS-3). These \nmeasures should integrate the principles of cleaner production into product design and \nproduction processes with the objective of conserving raw materials as well as energy \nand water. When selecting resource efficiency techniques for the project, the client \nneeds to refer to the World Bank Group\u2019s Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines \nor to host country regulations, whichever is more stringent (para.6, PS-5). Where \nbenchmarking data are available, clients shall establish the comparative level of \nefficiency (para.6, PS-3). With regard to waste materials, clients are requested to avoid, \nor if unavoidable, reduce their generation and to recover and reuse waste (para.12, PS-\n3). \n\u25ba The Access to Information Policy  defines IFC\u2019s commitment to transparency. \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : The IFC Sustainability Framework and its components have been adopted by the IFC \nBoard of Directors. Its operational implementation lies with the Bank\u2019s project staff who supervise \nproject implementation. As described in the previous Section, the Internal Audit Vice Presidency (IAD) \nis an assurance and consulting activity focused on evaluating the effectiveness of governance, risk \nmanagement, and control processes in the World Bank Group. The World Bank Group\u2019s Independent \nEvaluation Group (IEG), which operates independently of the Bank\u2019s management carries out \n(\u201cexternal\u201d) evaluations across the World Bank Group, reporting directly to the Board of Executive \nDirectors. Both IAD and IEG can potentially review the implementation and effectiveness of the FC \nSustainability Framework. \nEvaluation and review: When a client receives project funding from the IFC, an IFC Environmental and \nSocial (E&S) team reviews the information provided by the client regarding assets and management of \nE&S risks and impacts and assesses the project against the Performance Standards and EHS \nGuidelines, potentially including information received in meetings with local stakeholders. The IFC\u2019s \nEnvironmental and Social Review Summary is published. \n \n684 CAO (2010). FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n171 Reporting: Monitoring of the project includes the review of clients\u2019 Annual Monitoring Reports on \nprogress in meeting the E&S terms of the investment agreement, as well as site visits from IFC staff. \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: IFC\u2019s Compliance Advisor/ \nOmbudsman (CAO) is an independent office that is required to impartially respond to environmental \nand social concerns of affected communities, and aims to enhance IFC accountability and outcomes. \nStakeholder and public involvement: PS-1 defines that \u201cstakeholder engagement is the basis for \nbuilding strong, constructive, and responsive relationships that are essential for the successful \nmanagement of a project's environmental and social impacts\u201d (para.25, PS-1). Depending on the \nproject\u2019s risks and adverse impacts, and its phase of development, clients are required to employ \nstakeholder analysis and planning, disclosure and dissemination of information, consultation and \nparticipation, grievance mechanism, and ongoing reporting to Affected Communities. For projects with \npotential significant adverse impacts on \u201cAffected Communities\u201d and projects involving indigenous \npeoples, IFC makes a determination of the level of community support for the project. \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: The IFC Performance Standards draw on and \nrelate to a number of international norms,685 these references being much more concrete than in the \ncase of the World Bank\u2019s ESS, except for a reference to a human rights instrument. \nPolitical weight of the instrument: Judging from the high profile of the political discussions on IFC \nstandards and their revision, the IFC Standards can be assessed to have a similar high political weight \nas the World Bank\u2019s Environmental and Social Standards, despite their focus on private sector clients. \nThis is likely a consequence of the contentious nature and increasing volume of activities by \nmultinational corporations in developing countries and emerging economies.686 \nEffectiveness: Despite the fact that the current Performance Standards have been adopted already in \n2012, no systematic evaluation has since been carried out. It can be assumed that as to its effectiveness \nand impacts similar caveats apply as in the case of the World Bank\u2019s Environmental and Social \nStandards (see above). \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: With the IFC\u2019s Sustainability Framework still \nrelatively young, there seem no immediate opportunities ahead for influencing the clout of the \nprovisions on resource efficiency. \n \n685 Including the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic \nPollutants, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, the Basel Convention on hazardous waste, \nthe Biodiversity Convention, the Ramsar Convention, the World Heritage Convention as well as labour-related conventions \nby ILO and the UN. \n686 See e.g. UNCTAD (2017).

With regard to resource efficiency, the Strategy posits that new sources of growth can open up \nthrough \u201cincentives for greater efficiency in the use of resources and natural assets, including \nenhancing productivity, reducing waste and energy consumption, and making resources available to \ntheir highest value use.\u201d691 A caveat regarding resource protection is that the concept of Green Growth \nis based on the connection of resource indicators with economic indicators which results in a focus on \nresource productivity rather than on an absolute reduction of resource consumption. A considerable \nnumber of activities have been and are carried out implementing the Strategy. \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  The Green Growth Strategy is non-binding on OECD (and other) countries, \nintended to serve as a framework for national policies. The Green Growth Declaration which is the \nbasis for the Green Growth Strategy was signed by the 34 OECD member states in 2009. \n \n687 Non-OECD countries: Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Colombia, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Morocco, Peru, \nhttp://www.oecd.org/greengrowth/greengrowthincountriesandterritories.htm#oecd. \n688 OECD Council (2009). \n689 The Strategy package consists of four documents: \u201cTowards Green Growth\u201d (OECD 2011e), \u201cTowards Green Growth - \nMonitoring Progress: OECD Indicators\u201d (OECD 2011d), \u201cTools for Delivering Green Growth\u201d (OECD 2011b) \u201cTowards green \ngrowth: A summary for policy makers\u201d OECD (2011c).

FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n173 Objectives: The objectives include the promotion of economic growth (in the face of the financial crisis \n2008) while protecting the environment, notably the decoupling of growth and environmental \nimpacts. \nTerritorial scope:  global (all OECD members and other countries). \nResources covered:  Biotic and abiotic resources.  \nSteps of the value chain covered:  extraction, production, consumption, waste management \nType of steering mechanism:  The Green Growth Strategy  includes knowledge exchange, capacity \nbuilding, recommendations for green growth policies as well as the mainstreaming of policies, the \ndevelopment of green growth indicators and monitoring of country performance with regard to these \nindicators.  \nContent \nRelevant provisions/ guidelines for governments: The implementation of the Green Growth Strategy \nitself is voluntary. To support policy makers in implementing Green Growth policies, a number of \nrecommendations and respective toolkits have been developed, most notably the report \u201cTools for \ndelivering Green Growth\u201d.692 However, these policy recommendations remain at a rather general level \nand without an explicit reference to resource efficiency (cf. Figure 1): \nFigure 1:  Possible policies to address green growth constraints \n \nSource: OECD (2011b), at 9. \n \n692 OECD (2011b). \n \nFKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n174 Additional papers, reports, recommendations research results etc. regarding an abundance of green \ngrowth issues are continuously published.693  \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : A number of OECD Directorates and Committees including the Environment Policy \nCommittee were involved in the Strategy development, and respectively are involved in its \nimplementation.694 An \u201cOECD Horizontal Programme on Green Growth\u201d has been created. \nEvaluation and review:  The Green Growth indicators from 2011 and 2014 have been updated in 2017. \nIndicators with relevance for the efficiency of abiotic resources include (non-energy) \u201cmaterial \nproductivity\u201d, including demand based material productivity, domestic material productivity \n(GDP/DMC) and waste generation intensities and recovering ratios; as well as environmentally \nadjusted multi-factor productivity. Information concerning a review of the Strategy as a whole is not \navailable.  \nReporting: Building on the general framework developed in the Green Growth Strategy, the OECD is \nmainstreaming green growth in its national and multilateral policy surveillance exercises to provide \npolicy advice that is targeted to the needs of individual countries. These include the Economic Surveys, \nEnvironmental Performance Reviews, Innovation Reviews, and Investment Policy Reviews, as well as \nthe Going for Growth annual report and the Green Cities Programme. These analyses cover advanced, \nemerging and other economies.695 Additionally, a set of Green Growth indicators has been developed \nwhich include indicators on environmental and resource productivity and the natural asset base (land \nresources, forest resources etc.).696 The status of countries green growth is assessed and discussed \naccording to this set of indicators.697 In 2015, a report was published assessing the overall progress698 \nand the Green Growth indicators report from 2017 also charts the progress that OECD countries have \nmade since 1990.699 Its main finding is that while there are signs of greening growth in the OECD, \ncountries are progressing too slowly on green growth. With regard to material productivity and waste, \nuses material extraction has grown since 1980 by over 200%, largely due to non-metallic minerals \n(including contruction and industrial minerals) which increased by more than 300%. Productivity \ngains have been achieved especially in European countries and Korea while it remains low and \nstagmant in BRICS economies. However, overall consumption of non-energy material resources \nremains high in OECD countries (ca. 14% higher than in BRICS countries) and changing trade patterns \n(notably the discplacement of resource-intensive production to other countries) account for some of \nthe productivity gains. With regard to the gernation of waste, a modest decoupling from economic \ngrowth and from population growth has taken place in most OECD countries.700 With regard to \npolicies, environmentally-related tax revenues have decreased between 1995 and 2014, while OECD \ncountries continue to support potentially environmentally harmful activities. \n \n693 http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/oecd-green-growth-studies_22229523, or http://www.oecd-\nilibrary.org/environment/oecd-green-growth-papers_22260935.  \n694 Apart from the OECD Environmental Policy Committee these include, among others, the OECD Working Party on \nEnvironmental Information, the Environment Directorate, the Economics Department, the Directorate for Financial and \nEnterprise Affairs, the Development Cooperative Directorate, the Public Governance and Territorial Development \nDirectorate, the Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation, the Trade ad Agriculture Directorate, the Staistics \nDirectorate, the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration and the Internaitonal Energy Agency; cf.

In accordance with this, the Green Growth Strategy is embedded into other OECD \npolicies and recommendations. Still, it can be assumed that the stretegy\u2019s \u201cgreen\u201d emphasis and its \n\u201cgrowth\u201d impetus can result in incoherence when it comes to the absolute reduction of resource \nconsumption.  \nPolitical weight of the instrument: Considering the importance of the OECD as an institution and the \nconsiderable number of activities linked to the Green Grwoth Strategy its political weight can be \nconsidered as rather high.  \nEffectiveness:  The high number of monitoring, informatory and capacity building activities suggests \nthat the Strategy is implemented with significant commitment. A caveat regarding resource protection, \nhowever, is that the concept of Green Growth is based on the connection of resource indicators with \neconomic indicators which results in a focus on resource productivity rather than on an absolute \nreduction of resource consumption.  \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: A number of events linked to the OECD Green \nGrowth Strategy take place continuously around the world.702 A regular event is the \u201cGreen Growth \nand Sustainable Development (GGSD) Forum\u201d. However, the events do not necessarily have a focus on \nresource efficiency. \nBest practice includes the attempt at mainstreaming green growth into numerous policies at domestic \nlevel, as well as the development of an indictator set to monitor countries green growth status and \ndevelopment over time.  \n \n701 Visser (2009). \n702 cf. http://www.oecd.org/greengrowth/.

It encourages the OECD members to \nimprove resource productivity by promoting environmentally effective and economically efficient uses \nof natural resources and materials at the macro, sectoral and micro levels as well as to strengthen \ncapacity for analysing material flows and the associated environmental impacts. The OECD\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy Committee facilitated the process and was required to report back to the Council \nwithin five years (i.e. 2013). However, there are no current documents available indicating that the \nEnvironment Policy Committee has indeed assessed member countries\u2019 respective activities. \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  The Council Recommendation is a legally non-binding recommendation for \nOECD member states. While OECD Recommendations are not binding practice accords them moral \nforce as representing the political will of member countries and there is an expectation that member \ncountries will fully implement a Recommendation. Thus, member countries which do not intend to \nimplement a Recommendation usually abstain when it is adopted.703 \nObjectives: The objective of the recommendation is to guide and support the efforts of the OECD \nmember countries to improve resource productivity along the entire resource cycle. Negative effects \non the environment are taken into account as well as the prevention of natural resource degradation. \nThe Recommendation applies to policies and measures that are needed to improve resource \nproductivity and to the knowledge that is needed to inform such policies and measures.704  \nTerritorial scope:  OECD member states, though members are also encouraged to cooperate on resource \nproductivity with non-OECD members. \nResources covered:  The Recommendation covers natural resources (and the materials and products \nderived therefrom) whose extraction, processing, use and disposal are internationally significant, in \nboth economic and environmental terms. The scope of the Recommendation is limited to minerals \n(metallic and non-metallic industrial minerals) and biomass. Energy resources (e.g. coal, oil, gas), \n \n703 http://www.oecd.org/legal/legal-instruments.htm. \n704 OECD Council (2008). \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n177 water resources and fishery resources are excluded and are only covered to the extent that they are \npart of an integrated approach to the entire resource cycle.705 \nSteps of the value chain covered:  The recommendation addresses the entire value-chain.  \nType of steering mechanism: High-level political statement by OECD with strategic priorities and \nguidance.  \nContent \nRelevant provisions/ guidelines for governments: The recommendation asks OECD countries \ngovernments to promote resource productivity by strengthening their capacity for analysing material \nflows and the associated environmental impacts, and work to improve measurement systems for \nmaterial flows and resource productivity. Also, OECD members shall take appropriate actions to \nimprove resource productivity and reduce negative environmental impacts of materials and product \nuse, by encouraging environmentally effective and economically efficient uses of natural resources and \nmaterials at the macro, sectoral and micro levels and by involving all relevant ministries and \ndepartments of government as well as research and other non-governmental organisations. 706 \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : The institutions involved in developing the Recommendations were the OECD Council, the \nOECD Environment Policy Committee and the OECD Environment Directorate. \nEvaluation and review: No evaluation or review of the Recommendations has taken place. \nReporting: The Environment Policy Committee is instructed to facilitate the process and to report to \nthe Council on progress achieved in implementing the recommendation within five years of its \nadoption (i.e., 2013). A 2011 publication on \u201cResource Productivity in the G8 and the OECD\u201d707 \nresponds to a request by G8 Environment Ministers at their meeting in Kobe in 2008 (see below, \nSection 2.2.13) and anounces that \u201cA complete evaluation of progress with work related to resource \nproductivity will be prepared for 2013, in the framework of reporting on OECD\u2018s Council \nRecommendation on Resource Productivity\u201d. However, no current documents indicate that this \nevaluation was indeed carried out.   \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: The Council Recommendation on Resource \nProductivity refers to several prior OECD recommendations (e.g. the 2004 Council Recommendation \non Material Flows and Resource Productivity, various Council Decisions and Recommendations on \ntransboundary movements of waste, waste prevention, extended producer responsibility, \nenvironmentally sound management of waste, sustainable materials management and the the \nimplementation of the OECD environmental strategy), to the G8 \u201c3R\u201d initiative and to work by the \nInternational Resource Panel.708 \nPolitical weight of the instrument: Even though the OECD Council is an important institution the lack of \nfollow-up by the Environment Policy Committee indicates that this particular recommendation does \nnot carry sufficient political weight.  \n \n705 OECD Council (2008). \n706 OECD Council (2008). \n707 OECD (2011a). \n708 OECD Council (2008). \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n178 Effectiveness:  No evaluation exists of the implementation and effectiveness of the OECD \nRecommendation. The International Resource Panel\u2019s 2016 study \u201cGlobal material flows and resource \nproductivity\u201d709 can be seen to indirectly suppprovide data input into such an (impact) evaluation \nsince it created a unified data set on global and country by country material use (not, however, \ndelivering aggregate data on OECD resource use and productivity).  \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: Since the process seems to have stalled no political \nopportunities or good practice examples can be identified. \n \n2.2.12 G20 Dialogue on Resource Efficiency  \nTable 26:  G20 Dialogue on Resource Efficiency (adoption: 2017) \nKey aspects  Summary  \nForm and legal status annex to legally non-binding G20 document  \nObjectives Best practice exchange, spread resource efficient solutions and policies \nAddressees G20 countries  \nTerritorial scope G20 \nResources covered Not specified / all \nStage of the value chain  Not specified / all \nSteering mechanisms knowledge exchange, learning forum \nPolitical weight (to be assessed when operational) \nRelevance for RE ++ \nSummary \nThe German government put the issue of resource efficiency onto the \u201cGroup of 20\u201d (G20)\u2019s agenda for \nthe first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg, in July 2017, following a G20 workshop on resource \nefficiency in March 2017 (Berlin). In Hamburg, the launch of a \u201cG20 Resource Efficiency Dialogue\u201d was \nagreed on, the agreement forming an Annex to the G20s Leaders Declaration.710 The Dialogue is \nvoluntary and supposed to include the \u201cBusiness 20\u201d (i.e. the private sector mechanism of the G20) \nand other relevant stakeholders. The kick-off event was hosted by the German Presidency in \nNovember 2017. The Dialogue covers all natural resources and all steps of the value chain. Its political \nrelevance will depend on the weight it is given by the Presidencies and the willingness of G20 member \nstates to participate. \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  The Dialogue is anchored in an Annex to the G20 Leaders Declaration of 2018. \nParticipation is voluntary. \nObjectives: The G20 Resource Efficiency Dialogue aims at improving the exchange of knowledge on \npolicy options and good practices for improving resource efficiency along the entire life-cycle of \nnatural resources, products and infrastructure. The Dialogue shall help spread resource-efficient \nsolutions and options to strengthen countries\u2019 national resource efficiency policies.711  \n \n709 IRP (2016). \n710 G20 (2017). \n711 G20 (2017), p. 1. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n179 Territorial scope:  G20 member countries. \nResources covered:  Not specified; all natural resources. A focus on raw materials  was rejected by G20 \nmembers interested in exporting such raw materials, while efficiency with regard to other resources \n(e.g., water) was seen to be less contentious. \nSteps of the value chain covered:  All steps of the value chain.  \nType of steering mechanism: High-level political statement with strategic priorities and guidance; \nforum for exchange of best practice and learning.  \nContent \nRelevant provisions/ guidelines for governments: The dialogue does not aim at developing guidelines as \nsuch. Three broad subjects have been suggested for the dialogue: a) Cooperation on implementing \nresource-related SDGs, b) Broadening the knowledge base on global resource use and future resource \nneeds, c) Exchange of good practices on resource-efficient solutions along the entire life-cycle.  \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : The main institution within the G20 which is supposed to organize and implement the G20 \nResource Efficiency Dialogue (by funding workshops, commissioning studies etc.) is the respective \nG20 Presidency.  \nEvaluation and review: Currently, no evaluation or review processes are in place.  \nReporting : No reporting requirements exist do date.   \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: No respective procedures exist.  \nStakeholder and public involvement:  International organizations and relevant stakeholders such as \nbusiness (including the more than 700 companies forming part of the \u201cBusiness 20\u201d initiative712), \nacademia and civil society \u2018may be included\u2019 in the dialogue. 713 \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: The resource-related SDGs are one of the \nsuggested first subjects the Dialogue is supposed to address. A link to the G7 Alliance for Resource \nEfficiency (see below) was rejected by some of the G20 members, arguing that resource-efficiency \nproblems in newly industrialising countries differ from those in G7 countries.  \nPolitical weight of the instrument:  While the G20 is a high-level political forum, there is no institutional \nsub-structure or budget envisaged for initiatives such as the Dialogue on Resource Efficiency. Hence, \nthe political weight of the Dialogue will depend on the importance that G20 Presidencies attribute to it.  \nEffectiveness:  While the Dialogue is not equipped with an implementation mechanism, it represents a \nfirst-time obligation to regularly discuss resource efficiency issues within the G20. The extent to which \nthis depends on the engagement of the respective G20 presidency. After its launch in 2017 through the \nGerman G20 Presidency, the topic of resource efficiency had not featured prominently during the 2018 \nArgentinian Presidency714 but was taken up again by the Japanese Presidency in 2019.

Waste reduction and utilisation are highlighted, including \nthe concept of waste as an alternative source of energy to fossil fuels. The OECD was asked to track the \nprogress of the G8 countries in adopting 3R policies and produced an interim report in 2011.717 The \nreport found that, despite increased resource productivity, the material consumption of G8 and OECD \neconomies continued to grow and recommended further decoupling.  \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  Legally non-binding. \nObjectives: The Plan\u2019s objective is to promote implementation of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle (\u201c3R\u201d) \nactivities in G8 countries.  \nTerritorial scope:  Member states of the (then) G8. \nResources covered:  Biotic and abiotic wastes. \nSteps of the value chain covered:  Waste management. \n \n715 https://www.g20.org/en/documents/. \n716 http://english.cri.cn/4426/2008/05/26/1781@362157.htm. \n717 OECD (2011a). FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n181 Type of steering mechanism: High-level political statement with strategic priorities and guidance.  \nContent \nRelevant provisions/ guidelines for governments:  G8 countries are to take concrete actions with regard \nto the three goals of the Kobe 3R Action Plan:  \n\u25ba Goal 1: Prioritize 3Rs Policies and Improve Resource Productivity: This includes the \nactivities of prioritizing implementation of 3Rs policy, improving resource productivity and \nsetting targets, pursuing co-benefits between the 3Rs and GHG reductions, as well as \npromoting science and technology and creating a market for 3Rs-related products; \n\u25ba Goal 2: Establishment of an International Sound Material-Cycle Society: Under this goal, the \nG8 countries are to collaborate to promote sound international resource circulation and to \npromote international trade of 3Rs-related materials, goods and products;  \n\u25ba Goal 3: Collaborate for 3Rs Capacity Development in Developing Countries: Actions for the \nG8 member states include promoting collaboration with developing countries, to promote \ntechnology transfer, information sharing and environmental education, as well as to \npromote partnerships between stakeholders. \nWhile the Kobe 3R Action Plan views the free movement of goods, materials and technologies an \nopportunity to increase the efficient use of resources, a more trade-restrictive approach is taken with \nregard to wastes: the Plan\u2019s primary objective is to reduce waste and to promote its sound \nmanagement, while transboundary flows of wastes are primarily promoted where they are expected \nto efficient use of resources and reduce environmental pollution.718  \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : Adopted by the G8, the OECD functions as a review body to evaluate progress against the \nPlan\u2019s targets. \nEvaluation and review: The OECD was mandated to track progress of the Action Plan\u2019s implementation \nin 2011 and \u2018at appropriate intervals thereafter\u2019. \nReporting: So far, one report has been published by the OECD, reviewing the state of implementation \nafter three years.719 \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: No such procedures are in place.  \nStakeholder and public involvement: The Action Plan explicitly aims at promoting partnership between \nstakeholders, including SMEs, NGOs and the scientific community on 3Rs activities (cf. Goal 3).  \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: The Action Plan seeks to work with other \ninternational comitments like SDG 12 or activities including by UNEP, UNCRD, the Basel Convention \nand the OECD (e.g., the OECD Council Decision on the transboundary movement of wastes720). Due to \nits general objectives, no target conflicts seem likely.  \n \n718 Grosz (2011), at 293. \n719 OECD (2011a).

FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n182 Political weight of the instrument: The Plan\u2019s political weight is considered to be relatively low. It \nsimply states the G8 countries\u2019 commitment to 3Rs. There has been no further follow-up after the \nOECD\u2019s implementation report in 2011.  \nEffectiveness:  The OECD\u2019s 2011 Progress Report finds that \u2018OECD countries will need to make \nsignificant additional efforts to further improve the resource productivity of their economies\u2019. While \nresource productivity has increased in the OECD, overall material consumption continued to rise and \nwas still largely coupled with economic growth (though within the G8, Canada, Germany, Italy and \nJapan have succeeded in decoupling material consumption from economic growth in absolute terms). \nThese findings are confirmed in a more recent OECD report on material resources and resource \nproductivity (published independent of the Kobe Action Plan implementation).721 The fact that the \nKobe 3R Action Plan requests that aid agencies reflect the concept of the 3Rs in development projects \nand aims to promote technology transfer indicate that the scope of its impact at least potentially can \nreach beyond the G8 and even OECD member states. \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: Potentially, future G8 (respectively, G7) summits \nand meetings can serve as platform to review and update the Kobe Plan of Action. It can be assumed, \nhowever, that such follow-up activities would be incorporated in the newer G7 Alliance on Resource \nEfficiency (see below). \n \n2.2.14 G7 Alliance for Resource Efficiency (2015) \nTable 28:  G7 Alliance for resource efficiency (adoption: 02/10/2015) \nKey aspects  Summary  \nForm and legal status alliance based on non-binding G7 document \nObjectives improve resource efficiency across the whole value chain. \n Addressees G7 countries  \nTerritorial scope G7 (indirectly, global) \nResources covered all natural resources \nStage of the value chain  entire value chain \nSteering mechanisms high-level political statement with strategic priorities and guidance; \nlearning/ exchange of best practice \nPolitical weight +/++ \nRelevance for RE +++ \nSummary \nThe G7 Alliance for Resource Efficiency is a forum established by the \u201cGroup of 7\u201d (G7) states \n(launched under German G7 presidency) in 2015 to enhance and align the cooperation between the G7 \nstates regarding resource efficiency.  \nIn 2016, the \u201cToyama Framework on Material Cycles\u201d was adopted by the Alliance.

In \n \n721 OECD (2015a). \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n183 2017, the \u201cBologna Roadmap\u201d was adopted which prioritizes actions that advance life cycle based \nmaterials management, resource efficiency, and the 3Rs, including in the supply chain (see below). \nThe UNEP\u2019s International Resource Panel and the OECD were requested by the G7 at its Elmau Summit \nin 2015 to identify the most promising solutions and approaches for increasing resource efficiency.722 \nThe OECD analyzed existing policy instruments and found that current measures primarily targeted \nthe downstream stages of products\u2019 lifecycles.723 They therefore asked governments to concentrate \ntheir focus on the upstream stages as well \u2013 for example, on the phases of product design, production \nand consumption. The OECD has also stressed the value of international cooperation in this area.  \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  Legally non-binding forum of G7 states to share knowledge and create \ninformation networks.  \nObjectives: The Alliance\u2019 objective is to promote an exchange of concepts on how to address the \nchallenges of resource efficiency, to share best practices and experience, and to create information \nnetworks. \nTerritorial scope:  The G7 member countries directly participate in the forum and developing and \nemerging countries are intended to benefit from the research. \nResources covered:  Not specified; all natural resources. \nSteps of the value chain covered:  All steps of the value chain.  \nType of steering mechanism: High-level political statement with strategic priorities and guidance; \nforum for exchange of best practice and learning.  \nContent \nRelevant provisions/ guidelines for governments: The Toyama Framework on Material Cycles (2016) \nspecified that G7 member countries should increasingly integrate resource efficiency in their national \npolicies and strategies, targeting the whole value chain. The countries also envisioned an expansion of \nthe G7 Alliance on Resource Efficiency, transfer of technology and knowledge to developing and \nemerging countries and voluntary activities and initiatives within the economic sector and society. \nThe Bologna Roadmap (2017) determines that the G7 Alliance takes actions to, among others: \ncontinue to develop resource efficiency indicators; assess the potential GHG reductions of resource \nefficiency policies; share information on best practices as well as on barriers to repair, refurbishment, \nremanufacturing, reuse and recycling from a business perspective, regarding international material \nmanagement; develop macroeconomic analysis of resource efficiency impacts; strengthen citizen \ninvolvement and public awareness regarding resource efficiency goals; develop case studies on \nindustry best practice on resource efficiency; address barriers to recycling and reuse of plastic; build \ncapacity on Green Public Procurement; and explore lifetime extension product policies, explore \nresource efficiency and the Next Production Revolution. \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : The Alliance is tied to the organisational structures of the G7.  \nEvaluation and review: No specific mechanisms for evaluation and review are provided for. \n \n722 IRP (2017b). \n723 OECD (2016b). \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n184 Reporting: There is no reporting mechanism included in the Alliance. However, the G7 asked UNEP\u2019s \nInternational Resource Panel to prepare a synthesis report highlighting the most promising potentials \nand solutions for resource efficiency and OECD to develop policy guidance supplementing the \nsynthesis report.724 \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: No such procedures exist.  \nStakeholder and public involvement: The Alliance aims to collaborate with businesses, SMEs, and other \nrelevant stakeholders to advance opportunities offered by resource efficiency, promote best practices, \nand foster innovation.  \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: The Alliance is in line with other international \ninstruments, including SDG 8.4, SDG 12, the Kobe 3R Action Plan, the OECD Recommendation on \nResource Productivity etc.  \nPolitical weight of the instrument:  The political weight seems low to medium. While focusing on \nresource efficiency at the 2015 G7 summit attracted significant attention, the Alliance as such is not \nvery visible. Also, it is limited to the G7 and not supported by a specific institutional structure or \nfunding.  \nEffectiveness:  So far, a number of events and workshops have been carried out under the banner of the \nAlliance, among others in Germany (inaugural event, 2015), the UK (on industrial symbiosis, 2015), \nthe US (on life cycle concepts in supply chain management), Japan (on resource efficiency and low \ncarbon society, 2016), Italy (follow up of Bologna Roadmap; 2017), Canada (on value retention \npolicies) and France (on tools making value chains more circular and resource-efficient, 2019). It is \ndifficult to trace whether these events have inspired the transfer of best practice. In 2018, the G7\u2019s \nenvironmental ministers expressed support for the Alliance to establish an e-repository for the work \nand best practices. \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples: The G7 Alliance on Resource Efficiency regularly \nmeets in the context of G7 meetings. \n \n2.2.15 Assessment \nOur analysis shows that a number of international political processes and legally non-binding \nmechanisms (in the following: \u201cinstruments\u201d) promoting resource efficiency have emerged in the past \nyears \u2013 the process of agenda-setting can be said to have come some way.  \nIn terms of their steering mechanisms, the instruments are most often what we term \u201chigh-level \npolitical statements with strategic priorities and guidance\u201d \u2013 i.e., non-binding recommendations and \njoint frameworks of action. In some cases, these are combined with a small capacity building \ncomponent or \u201cmeans of implementation\u201d for developing countries (e.g., UNEP GEI and GI REC, the \nNew Urban Agenda). Also, various instruments are tied to knowledge dissemination through the \nexchange of best practice between countries, learning forums, or pilot projects. The International \nResource Panel provides the basis for creating new scientific knowledge (such as assessments of \npolicy options with regard to their effects on resource efficiency)725 and feeding it into the policy \ndebate. It is a valuable mechanism for fostering a common understanding of the problem, its drivers \nand potential solutions. A relatively new governance mechanism is \u201cgoverning through goals\u201d726, as it \n \n724 The respective report is IRP (2017a). \n725 See, for instance, IRP (2017b). \n726 Kanie et al. (2017). FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n185 is embodied by the SDGs. It leaves leeway to countries to operationalise the attainment of (quantified) \ngoals and monitors goal attainment, though it is typically not tied to any sanctions if goals are missed. \nAn interesting governance mechanism is the World Bank\u2019s and IFC\u2019s sustainability standards for \ncountry borrowers and private sector clients, which are binding to the extent that they become part of \ncontracts, though capacity building (of all parties), monitoring and enforcement still provide \nchallenges. \nIn most cases, the analysed instruments address all UN member states, with an implicit focus on \ndeveloping countries and emerging economies, as OECD countries have progressed somewhat further \nin the direction of resource efficiency policies. An exception are the SDG, which explicitly also request \nindustrialised countries to speed up their efforts. Also, the OECD, G7/8 and G20 have committed to \nfurther promoting resource efficiency. \nMost of the instruments address the complete value chain, i.e. do not specify any particular segments \nof the value chain (or any particular sectors) in which resource efficiency should be enhanced, though \na few are focused on extraction, others on waste and the 3Rs. The intermediate segments of the value \nchain are rarely addressed explicitly.  \nWe can distinguish at least three different pathways of effects: some instruments directly fund \nresource efficiency projects (e.g., UNEP GEI); others fund resource-consuming projects but require \nsome attention to resource efficiency (World Bank/ IFC safeguards); most instruments affect resource \nefficiency more indirectly by defining resource efficiency goals (SDGs, 10YFP, UNEP GEI, OECD Green \nGrowth Strategy etc.) or by stimulating (and partly funding the development of) specific resource \nefficiency policies (Kobe 3R Action Plan). \nAssessing the instruments\u2019 effectiveness is difficult. Did they really make governments re-direct, adapt \nor change their policies? There are only few in-depth evaluations and reviews on the (partly still new) \ninstruments, with the exception of, inter alia, the UNEP Green Economy Initiative and the G8 Kobe 3R \nAction Plan. However, for obvious methodological difficulties none of the existing evaluations traces \ncausalities from international initiatives to country-level changes in resource consumption. This type \nof analysis was also beyond the scope of this study. On a more generic level, it seems that while there \nare plenty policies, forums and platforms, some of these have a short life span and little follow-up. The \nWorld Bank Groups\u2019 lending conditionalities are relatively strong instruments because they are \nbinding on borrowers and clients. However, they affect only developing countries and actors, which \nalso raises the issue of double standards. Also, it is unclear to what extent specifically those \nconditionalities relevant for resource efficiency actually have an impact on project design and \nimplementation. Using proxies for effectiveness such as the instruments\u2019 specificity in terms of \ncommitment, their political weight and institutional design and substructures, most instruments are \nrelatively unspecific, have only moderate political clout, often feature insignificant international \nbudgets and no systematic review mechanisms. This holds for those instruments that are part of UN \nProgrammes (UNEP GEI & GI REC) and for strategy documents of multilateral groupings (OECD, G20, \nG8/7). UN initiatives adopted or endorsed by the General Assembly (SDGs, the New Urban Agenda, \n10YFP) tend to have a broader basis of legitimacy, but have review mechanisms with varying degrees \nof stringency. The SDGs presently seem to be the instrument with the best prerequisites to induce \nchange in political practices. \nHowever, the available analyses are sobering: despite past political efforts (as well as economic \ninnovations) promoting resource efficiency, rebound effects and generic economic growth overall \noutweigh the efficiency gains. This indicates that a new chapter should be opened: that of the absolute \nreductions in resource consumption (resource sufficiency). Here, the agenda setting process has not \neven started at the international level. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n186 2.3 Non-state and other governance approaches  \n2.3.1 Reporting \n2.3.1.1 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) \nTable 29:  Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) \nKey aspects  Summary  \nForm and legal status voluntary standard \nObjectives standardised (and therefore comparable) sustainability reporting by \ncompanies  \nInstitution/ Addressees Global Reporting Initiative (multi- stakeholder network)/companies  \nTerritorial scope global \nResources covered all \nStage of the value chain  production, use of recycled materials, end of life \nSteering mechanisms information, consultation, capacity building  \nPolitical weight medium: important in the context of non-financial reporting  \n(++) \nRelevance for RE medium/low: transparency about a company\u2019s resource consumption (GRI \n301: Materials)  \n(+/++) \nSummary \nReporting publicly on resource consumption at company level is not in itself an instrument to improve \nresource efficiency. Nevertheless, transparency can be the basis for further developments, mainly \nbecause it requires companies to gather respective data which are necessary if resource efficiency \nmeasures are to be adopted. A secondary effect might be that such data influence capital markets by \nmaking money cheaper and more easily available for resource efficient companies.727 \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  The GRI Standard is a voluntary reporting standard for companies and other \norganisations covering all aspects of non-financial reporting. The standard itself is developed by a \nprivate entity, the Global Reporting Initiative. \nObjectives: Non-financial reporting provides transparency about the sustainability performance and \nimpact of the respective company to its stakeholders. The objective of GRI is to provide a reporting \nstandard which can be applied universally and therefore serves to make data comparable.  \nThe objective of \u201cGRI 301: Materials\u201d is to indicate an organisation\u2019s dependency from and impact on \nresources and its approach to recycling, reusing and reclaiming.728  \nTerritorial scope:  Global \nResources covered:  GRI 301 refers to \u201cmaterials\u201d which include abiotic resources like metals, oil or gas. \nThe standard also asks for data on the use of primary and secondary material and for information \n \n727 https://www.globalreporting.org/Information/about-gri/Pages/default.aspx. \n728 GRI (2016). \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n187 about the reuse and reclaiming of products and packaging.729 Other resources like water or energy, \nwhich are not within the scope of this study, are covered in separate chapters of the reporting \nframework. \nSteps of the value chain covered:  The GRI itself covers all steps of the value chain. Information on \nsupply chains, waste management etc. is also required. However, a specific reference to (abiotic) \nresource use is only required within GRI 301.  \nType of steering mechanism: The GRI uses information tools like the standard itself or the GRI \nreporters\u2019 summit but also does capacity building in the form of webinars or conferences .730 \nFurthermore, there is a peer-to-peer learning platform for companies called the GRI Gold \nCommunity.731  \nContent \nRelevant provisions/ guidelines: As the GRI Standard is voluntary and does not address governments, \nno respective provisions or guidelines exist for states. Organisations publishing their sustainability \nreports referring to the GRI Standard have several options which include different obligations. If the \nStandard is only taken as a point of reference for sustainability reporting, they may use the statement \n\u2018GRI-referenced\u2019 on their publications. For reporting in accordance with the GRI Standard the options \n\u201ccore\u201d or \u201ccomprehensive\u201d may be chosen: \n\u25ba Core option: For each identified material aspect, the organisation has to disclose the \nGeneric DMA (Disclosure on Management Approach) and at least one indicator.  \n\u25ba Comprehensive option: For each identified material aspect, the organization should \ndisclose the Generic DMA and all indicators related to the material aspects.732 \nIn the latter cases GRI has to be notified of the statement of compatibility so it can be used in the \nreport that the organisation publishes.733 \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : The GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) is a multi-stakeholder initiative which comprises the \nfollowing governing bodies: board of directors, stakeholder council, GRI nominating committee, GRI \nGold Community and the secretariat.734 \nEvaluation and review: Evaluation and review of the standard is undertaken by the Global \nSustainability Standards Board (GSSB) under specific terms of reference735 following a formally \ndefined due process736. The recent revision process has resulted in the development of the so called \n\u201cGRI Standard\u201d (in contrast the former guidelines where named GRI 1 to GRI 4). In the future there will \nbe no revision of the entire standard but updates of the different modules.737  \n \n729 GRI (2016). \n730 https://www.globalreporting.org/information/events/Pages/default.aspx. \n731 https://www.globalreporting.org/information/about-gri/governance-bodies/Pages/default.aspx. \n732 GRI (2015). \n733 https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/questions-and-feedback/writing-a-report-in-accordance-with-the-\nstandards/. \n734 https://www.globalreporting.org/information/about-gri/governance-bodies/Pages/default.aspx.  \n735 GSSB (2015b). \n736 GSSB (2015a). \n737 http://info.greenstoneplus.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-gri-standards. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n188 Reporting:  The GRI Standard consists of modules divided into following chapters: foundation, general \ndisclosure, management approach, economic, environmental, and social.738 In addition, there are \nsupplementing sector guidelines e.g. oil and gas, media or NGO .739 \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: None \nStakeholder and public involvement: One of the GRI governing bodies is the stakeholder council \nconsisting of members from industry, civil society, labour organisations and mediating institutions. Its \ntask is to advise the board on strategic issues. Additionally, there is the GRI Gold Community for \nreporting organisations and the Governmental Advisory Group which is comprised of members from \ngovernmental and administrative entities from different countries. \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: The importance of sustainability reporting has \nbeen highlighted in para. 47 of the resolution adopted at the Rio +20 conference in 2012.740 The closest \nlegal link is to the EU directive on non-financial reporting.741 National implementation may require \ncompanies to include information about resource use/resource efficiency. The directive explicitly \nstates that resource efficiency is one of its aims: \u201cInvestors' access to non-financial information is a \nstep towards reaching the milestone of having in place by 2020 market and policy incentives \nrewarding business investments in efficiency under the roadmap to a resource-efficient Europe\u201d742. \nSuch provisions however, are currently not in place in any of the EU member states. Nevertheless, due \nto the current political importance of climate change (Paris Agreement), mandatory reporting of \nspecific ESG issues has been limited to resource use but on CO 2 emissions.743  \nDiffusion: 75% of all sustainability reports published today are following the GRI Standard.744 Some \ninstitutions like the Japanese stock exchange consider making sustainability reporting in accordance \nwith the GRI Standard mandatory for listed companies.745 Being the most widely used reporting \nframework globally, the GRI Standard sometimes serves as a reference point for the development of \nnational policies on non-financial reporting.746  \nEffectiveness:  It can be said that the gathering and publication of data relevant to resource use is a \nprecondition for the improvement of resource efficiency. In particular, publication of such data can be \nan incentive for companies to increase resource efficiency when performance is benchmarked with \nother companies of the same sector and if it influences access to funding. The general importance of \nsustainability reporting is increasingly acknowledged by governments (see above), not least due to the \ndemand for transparent and reliable Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data, from financial \nmarket actors747. \n \n738 https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/gri-standards-download-center/. \n739 https://www.globalreporting.org/information/g4/sector-guidance/sectorguidanceG4/Pages/default.aspx. \n740 United Nations (2012). \n741 Directive 2014/95/EU (2014). \n742 Directive 2014/95/EU (2014), p. 3. \n743 See Art. 174 VI of the loi n\u00b0 2015-992 du 17 ao\u00fbt 2015 relative \u00e0 la transition \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique pour la croissance verte and the \namendments in art.

However, unlike the GRI reporting standard, no set of \nKPIs exists to date which is recognised as a global standard.  \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  The KPIs developed by EFFAS are a voluntary ESG reporting standard. \nObjectives: The KPIs for ESG are supposed to meet the requirements of investment professionals who \nwish to include sustainability criteria into their investment decisions.750 \nTerritorial scope:  Global \nResources covered:  The scope of addressed resources depends on the sector. For most sectors data on \npackaging materials and recycability of products is required which can include abiotic resources. For \nsome sectors additional information on certain critical raw materials like cobalt or titanium have to be \nreported. Another KPI refers to production shortfalls due to material supply problems which also may \ninclude abiotic resources.751  \nSteps of the value chain covered:  By reporting on critical raw materials the supply chain is addressed, \nwhile the issues of packaging and recyclability refer to design, production and end of life. \nType of steering mechanism: The KPI system is an information tool. Additionally, EFFAS offers training \nprograms regarding the integration of ESG criteria.752 \nContent \nRelevant provisions/ guidelines: As the EFFAS set of KPIs is a voluntary reporting standard and does \nnot address governments, no respective provisions or guidelines exist. For companies reporting ESG \nKPIs according to the standard certain criteria, e. g. concerning data validity, are recommended but not \nmandatory.753 \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : The Standard is developed and published by private institutions: the EFFAS Commission \non ESG Environmental, Social & Governance Issues (CESG) and DVFA (Deutsche Vereinigung f\u00fcr \nFinanzanalyse und Asset Management GmbH).754 \nEvaluation and review: The standard is the result of a three-year process which included collaboration \nwith a network of investment professionals and experts around the globe.

Otherwise \ncompliance with international GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) is recommended.759 \nDiffusion: Unlike the GRI reporting standard, there does not yet exist a set of KPIs which is recognised \nas a sort of global standard and there are no data on the number of companies applying the EFFAS \nKPIs for ESG globally. However, there are indicators which point at a certain impact. According to a \nsurvey among German DAX30 companies some of them already use the set of indicators and the Swiss \nindex provider Stoxx aligns their index family Stoxx ESG Leaders Index with the EFFAS ESG KPis. \nInternationally the International Corporate Governance Network (ISCGN) refers to the KPIs and \nrefrains from developing their own set of indicators. EFFAS KPIs for ESG are also an integral part of \nthe Global Business Reporting Framework issued by the World Business Reporting Network. 760 \nEffectiveness:  It can be said that the gathering and publication of data relevant to resource use is a \nprecondition for the improvement of resource efficiency.

Hence, only processes taking place within the respective company are \nreviewed. \nType of steering mechanism: EMAS is a management system that uses different information tools and \nreporting/audit mechanisms.  \nContent \nRelevant provisions/ guidelines: Countries in the EU have to install/assign: competent bodies, \naccreditation and licensing bodies and environmental verifiers. Organisations have to register their \nparticipation with EMAS and publicise an annual externally reviewed report. The process of \nimplementing EMAS follows the logic of: plan/do/check/act: After an initial environmental review an \nenvironmental policy and a programme have to be developed (plan). This is followed by the \nimplementation of the environmental management system (do) and the internal environmental audit \n(check). Based on this audit, continuous environmental performance improvements are to be attained \n(act). 766  \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : There are five stakeholders/institutions responsible for implementing EMAS: EU \nCommission (with the EU-EMAS Helpdesk), the competent bodies assigned by the national \nenvironmental authorities, accreditation and licensing bodies also assigned by the national \nenvironmental authorities, environmental verifiers, as well as organisations implementing EMAS.767 \nEvaluation and review: The following institutions are responsible for the development of EMAS: \nEuropean Commission, the EMAS Committee in which member states are represented.768  \nReporting: EMAS demands the publication of an annual, independently validated environmental report \nwith detailed information on the core indicators. \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: Apart from the publication of an \nannual, independently validated environmental report and the implementation process (see 2.1.3), no \nother procedures are in place. \nStakeholder and public involvement:  See \u201cInstitutions\u201d  \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: EMAS is linked to different international \nnorms and standards: ISO 50001 (energy management system), ISO 26000 (Social Responsibility), ISO \n9001 (quality management) and OHSAS 18001 (occupational health and safety) .769 \n \n766 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/emas/join_emas/how_does_it_work_step0_en.htm. \n767 http://www.emas.de/meta/english-summary/. \n768 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/emas/join_emas/emas_governance_en.htm. \n769 http://www.emas.de/rechtliche-grundlagen/internationale-normen/. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n194 Diffusion:  The promotion of EMAS in the different member states differs and new registrations have \nonly been increasing moderately or not at all within the last years.770 Internationally ISO 14001 is the \nmore widely used environmental management standard.

Resource efficiency plays a role insofar as it is linked to environmental impacts. The \nimportance of the ISO standard is based on its global recognition. Thanks to its international \nrecognition ISO is an effective regime, but there are still missing links like the possibility to make \nclaims (labelling) or governmental regulation making the application mandatory. \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  ISO 14040 and 14044 are voluntary standards for life cycle assessments (LCA) \nissued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). \nObjectives: LCAs allows for direct comparison of products. This comparison is based on the \nenvironmental impact a product causes during its entire lifecycle. \nTerritorial scope:  Global \nResources covered:  All, because life cycle assessments address the environmental aspects and potential \nenvironmental impacts of products, services and processes e.g. use of resources and environmental \nconsequences of releases, throughout a product\u2019s life cycle from raw material acquisition through \nproduction, use, end of-life treatment, recycling and final disposal (i.e. cradle-to-grave). However, due \nto the impacts focus the use of resources is not in itself a key indicator but its impacts on global \nwarming, water or soil are assessed. \nSteps of the value chain covered:  All, because LCAs address the environmental aspects and potential \nenvironmental impacts, e.g. use of resources and environmental consequences of releases, throughout \na product\u2019s life cycle from raw material acquisition through production, use, end of-life treatment, \nrecycling and final disposal (i.e. cradle-to-grave). \nType of steering mechanism: The ISO Standards are an information tool. \nContent \nRelevant provisions/ guidelines: As the ISO standards are voluntary they do not include provisions or \nguidelines for governments. Companies using the ISO standards should follow the recommended steps \n(e.g. validation by a third party), but are not obliged to do so, since it is a voluntary standard that \ncannot be certified.773 If however, companies wish to publicise LCA data and refer to having used the \nISO standard a critical (external) review is mandatory.774 \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : International Organization for Standardization (ISO). \nEvaluation and review: ISO Standards are revised every five years by technical committees and \nworking groups which are formed by experts nominated by the national standard bodies. Additionally, \nISO liaison members exist which typically come from the industry .775 \nReporting: No formal reporting requirements exist. \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: No formal sanction mechanisms \nor compliance procedures exist. \n \n773 DIN (2006). \n774 Kl\u00f6pffer (2013). \n775 http://www.british-assessment.co.uk/guides/iso-90012015-why-and-how-are-standards-revised/.

The general public is not involved. \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: The development of the PEF (Product \nEnvironmental Footprint) standard of the European Commission is based on the ISO Standards.  \nDiffusion: There are no data available regarding the overall use of ISO 14040 and 14044 not least \nbecause in many cases LCAs are only applied for internal use. However, an international survey among \n274 companies has shown that more than half of the top managers are at least aware of LCAs.776  \nEffectiveness:  The effect of LCAs on resource efficiency depends on the focus of the respective life cycle \nassessment. If for example only CO 2 emissions are considered the effect will be different from an \nassessment where all environmental impacts are measured. The general effect is also difficult to assess \nbecause resource efficiency is no direct target of LCAs but rather an indirect effect which may occur \ndue to measures which are aimed at reducing specific environmental impacts.  \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples:  \nOpportunities for improving the instrument regarding resource efficiency:  \n\u25ba ISO Standards are revised every five years by technical committees and working groups \nwhich are formed by experts nominated by the national standard bodies. 777 No data on the \nschedule for the next revision of ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 are available. \nGood practice examples: \n\u25ba LCAs have the potential to make resource consumption/efficiency (indirectly) comparable. \n\u25ba ISO norms are voluntary but represent globally agreed upon standards.  \n \n776 https://www.pre-sustainability.com/lca-has-a-story-to-tell. \n777 http://www.british-assessment.co.uk/guides/iso-90012015-why-and-how-are-standards-revised/.

Currently PEF is in its \npilot phase. The political weight and impact on resource efficiency in the future will depend highly on \nthe specific design of the standard as well as on the legal framework.  \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  Currently the development of PEF is in its pilot phase. Therefore the future legal \nstatus is unclear. Different scenarios from keeping it entirely voluntary to making it mandatory for \ncompanies and products or for public procurement are discussed. Politically the development of PEF is \nanchored in the European Resource Efficiency Roadmap.  \nObjectives:  \nThe general objective is to make products comparable regarding their environmental impacts (see ISO \nabove in Section 2.3.3.1).  \nPolitically the PEF is following several objectives:  \n\u25ba Support the development of a \u201cSingle Market for Green Products\u201d by limiting the number of \n\u201cgreen claims\u201d  \n\u25ba Support international efforts towards the coordination of methodological developments \nand data availability  \n\u25ba The provision of principles for communicating environmental performance, such as \ntransparency, reliability, completeness, comparability and clarity778 \nTerritorial scope:  Currently the PEF is developed for members of the European single market.

FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n198 Resources covered:  All, insofar as their environmental impacts are of relevance. \nSteps of the value chain covered:  All (Life Cycle Assessment). \nType of steering mechanism: Unclear, since the development of PEF is still in its pilot phase. \nNonetheless, in its pilot phase stakeholders have been invited to express their interests via the EU \nCOM Wiki web platform. The Wiki web platform will be progressively completed with content and \ndeveloped further as the PEFCR (product category rules) work progresses, e.g. containing drafts to \nwhich comments will be collected via the Wiki webpage, information about meetings and a discussion \nplatform. Moreover, in February 2016 a Guidance of the PEF in its pilot phase has been published.779  \nContent \nRelevant provisions/ guidelines: As described above the future legal status including provisions and \nguidelines for governments and companies are still under discussion.   \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : The PEF Process is initiated and organised be the European Commission. \nEvaluation and review: The process of PEF development is currently in its pilot phase. At this point \n\u201cTechnical Secretariats\u201d (composed mainly by manufacturers from the respective sector) are \ndeveloping rules for their respective products. The drafts composed for each sector are then made \navailable for public consultation consultation. On the basis of the consultation a second draft is \nproduced.780  \nReporting: Currently there are no general reporting procedures in place. Nevertheless, the different \nresults of the pilot phase are available. \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures:  Apart from the above mentioned \nstakeholder processes no formalised procedures are currently in place.  \nStakeholder and public involvement:  The European Commission gathers views and additional \ninformation on potential measures related to Sustainable Consumption and Production through a \npublic consultation. As part of this, the Commission is consulting on options for policies implementing \nthe Product Environmental Footprint.781 \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: The development of PEF (Product \nEnvironmental Footprint) standard of the European Commission is based on the ISO Standards for \nLCAs. PEF is linked to the EU Resource Efficiency Roadmap that has been launched by the European \nCommission on 9 April 2013.782  \nDiffusion: The uptake of PEF will depend on its de facto implementation. In the current pilot phase two \nprojects are being conducted.783  \nEffectiveness:  The effect on resource efficiency will depend on how the PEF standards are used \nmeaning the focus of the respective life cycle assessment. \n \n779 https://www.aise.eu/our-activities/sustainable-cleaning-78/contributing-to-the-eu-agenda/product-environmental-\nfootprint-pef.aspx and http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/pdf/Guidance_products.pdf. \n780 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/ef_pilots.htm. \n781 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/policy_footprint.htm. \n782 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/policy_footprint.htm. \n783 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/policy_footprint.htm.

Additionally, GEN (Global Eco-Labelling \nNetwork) facilitates international knowledge exchange and the harmonisation of standards. While \nthese eco-labels are usually supported by governmental agencies their full potential, e.g. in public \nprocurement, is not utilised.  \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  Type I eco-labels have to adhere to the ISO 14024 standard. This means that \nthey are voluntary, multiple-criteria based, third party programs that award licenses which authorise FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n200 the use of environmental labels on products indicating overall environmental preferability of a \nproduct within a particular product category based on life cycle considerations.784 GEN (Global Eco-\nLabelling Network) is a non-profit organisation.785 Whether the labels have a specific legal status \ndepends on national legislation.  \nObjectives: Type I eco-labels identify products or services that have proven to be environmentally \npreferable overall, within a specific product or service category. Therefore they are designed to help \nconsumers make environmentally friendly choices.786 Furthermore, they can help producers to \ndevelop more environmentally friendly products.787 \nTerritorial scope:  Eco-labels have a national (e.g. Germany: Der Blaue Engel) or a regional (e.g. EU: EU \nEco Label; Scandinavia: Nordic Swan) scope, but can also be used internationally when the required \ncertification procedures can be implemented by the respective certification body. Additionally, there \nexists a global network (GEN) where all national and regional labels can become members. At the end \nof 2015 there were 27 members and four associate members spread across 57 countries and \nterritories. 788 \nResources covered:  The resources addressed by the eco-label criteria depend highly on the specific \nproduct. E.g. in the case of returnable bottles and glasses the addressed resource is e.g. silicium \ndioxide.789 \nSteps of the value chain covered:  Which steps of the value chain are covered depends on the specific \nproduct. E.g. in the case of computers there is a strong focus on the use phase meaning the longevity \nwhich is an important aspect regarding resource efficiency. Measures to improve a product\u00b4s lifespan \nare in this case among others: rechargeability, replaceability, battery/accumulator durability etc.  \nType of steering mechanism: Information (criteria sets), certification  \nContent \nRelevant provisions/ guidelines: There are no provisions or guidelines for governments. For companies \nin order to use the eco-label their product has to be certified by an independent certification body. \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : GEN: Activities are managed by a Board of Directors, and day-to-day operations are \nadministered by a General Affairs Office and Secretariat, both reporting to the Board. \nNational and regional labels: The specific institutions involved differ according to national or regional \ncontext. GEN members operate independently and take various forms, including government or quasi-\ngovernmental bodies, private organisations, trusts, institutes and councils.790  \nE.g. in Germany the Blue Angel is awarded by the following institutions: \n\u25ba Environmental Label Jury: independent, decision-making body that includes \nrepresentatives from environmental and consumer associations, trade unions, industry, the \ntrade, crafts, local authorities, academia, the media, churches, young people and the \nGerman federal states. \n \n784 https://www.globalecolabelling.net/what-is-eco-labelling/. \n785 https://www.globalecolabelling.net/about/gen-the-global-ecolabelling-network/. \n786 https://www.globalecolabelling.net/what-is-eco-labelling/. \n787 http://www.nordic-ecolabel.org/about/the-mission/. \n788 https://www.globalecolabelling.net/about/gen-structure/. \n789 RAL gGmbH (2011). \n790 https://www.globalecolabelling.net/about/gen-structure/.

It organises the process for \ndeveloping the relevant award criteria in independent expert hearings \u2013 which involve all \nrelevant interest groups.791 \nEvaluation and review: On the international level GEN members are subject to regular peer reviews \ncalled GENICES. GENICES is a peer review process that benchmarks members, after which they may \ngive input on standards/specifications to be included in the common internationally accepted \ndatabase of criteria. The aims of the peer review are: help new programs start more quickly, facilitate \ncertification of products that have been certified elsewhere, make international certification more \ncost-effective, facilitate exports of environmentally certified products, address and allay concerns \nabout trade barriers.792 \nFurthermore, the national and regional labels can have their own evaluation and review processes. In \nthe case of the German Blue Angel for example the Federal Environmental Agency and the RALgGmbH \ndevelop and update the criteria sets together with the respective experts. 793 \nReporting: There are no reporting requirements in place. \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures:  The specific processes may vary \nfor the different labels. In the case of the German \u201cBlauer Engel\u201d in the event of misuse of the label, a \nwarning letter will be sent to the label user. In the event of a breach of the Basic Award Criteria the \neco-label can be withdrawn.794 \nStakeholder and public involvement:  \nAs described above, the specific institutions involved differ according to national or regional context. \nIn Germany, for instance, the Environmental Label Jury includes representatives from environmental \nand consumer associations, trade unions, industry, the trade, crafts, local authorities, academia, the \nmedia, churches, young people and the German federal states.  \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: Type I eco-labels, unlike other eco-labels, are \ncompliant with WTO rules because they do not present a trade barrier.  \nDiffusion: There are currently 25 different Type I eco-labels from around the world registered as GEN \nmembers.795 The uptake of is very different from label to label. E.g. in Germany there are around \n12.000 products certified by the \u201cBlaue Engel\u201d796 while the Russian \u201cVitality Leaf\u201d has certified 96 \nproducts so far797.

Except for the SASF there are no specific standards because \nthe work of GeSI is based on projects addressing different sustainability issues within the ICT sector. \nThe difference to other sector initiatives is that several of those projects do address resource \nefficiency. The network does not seem to have political relevance.  \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  The Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) is a network comprising members \nfrom the ICT sector; participation does not include any formal requirements.812  \nObjectives: GeSI supports efforts to ensure environmental and social sustainability in the ICT sector \nand aims to foster collaborative and innovative approaches to sustainability.813  \nTerritorial scope:  global \nResources covered:  The projects that address resource efficiency are either referring to electricity thus \nonly indirectly to fossil resources or all resources used in electronical products, thus mainly abiotic \nresources. \nProject examples include: \n\u25ba Universal Power adapter and charger solution: The adoption of a universal charger \nsolution for mobile phones would result in a 50% reduction in standby energy \nconsumption.

Its goal is to promote the shift from waste to resource management. In order to \nachieve this goal there are standards for companies as well as communities. Pursuing the aim of zero \nwaste worldwide can be regarded as significant for resource efficiency. The impact and political \nweight of the network differs significantly according to specific national and local circumstances. \nThere are for example 232 Zero Waste Cities in Italy but only one in the UK and zero in Germany.822 \nOverview \nForm and legal status:  The Zero Waste International Alliance (ZWIA) is a non-profit \norganisation/network. Members of the network can be national organisations promoting zero waste \nin their country, businesses and cities/communities. National or regional members might be organised \ndifferently (e.g. Zero Waste Europe). \nObjectives:  ZWIA aims to zero waste worldwide as an ideal. It promotes alternatives to landfill and \nincineration and raises community awareness of the social and economic benefits that can be gained \nwhen waste is regarded as a resource.823 This means that ZWIA encourages designing, managing and \nprocessing products in order to systematically avoid and eliminate the volume and toxicity of waste \nand materials, and to conserve and recycle all resources instead of burning or burying them. In the \nlong run communities and businesses ZWIA are supposed to shift from waste management to resource \nmanagement.824 \n \n822 Zero Waste Europe (n.d.). \n823 http://zwia.org/aboutus/. \n824 http://zwia.org/aboutus/zwia-history/. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n208 To reach this goal ZWIA uses three different strategies: \n\u25ba Producer responsibility for industrial production and design \n\u25ba Community responsibility for consumption, discard use and disposal \n\u25ba Political responsibility for bringing community and industrial responsibility together \nTerritorial scope:  Global \nResources covered:  ZWIA covers all forms of waste and therefore also abiotic resources.  \nSteps of the value chain covered:  ZWIA covers the whole lifecycle of the value chain (except the supply \nchain) taking the end of life phase as starting point.  \nType of steering mechanism: The Zero Waste International Alliance initiates and facilitates research \nand information sharing for the promotion of Zero Waste. Furthermore, it builds capacity to effectively \nimplement Zero Waste and sets standards for the application of Zero Waste.825 \nContent \nRelevant provisions/ guidelines: ZWIA offers voluntary programs, therefore no provisions or guidelines \nfor governments exist. However, if businesses or communities want to be recognized as \u201cZero Waste \nCommunities\u201d or \u201cZero Waste Businesses\u201d certain requirements have to be met.  \nCommunity Recognition: \nThe Recognition Program is designed to recognise communities that have a Zero Waste goal and have \nreduced or are working towards reducing their waste disposal by landfilling an dincineration by 90% \nor more. There are a number of additional conditions in order to participate in the Program.  \nEligible entities are local governments or Regional Districts that have jurisdiction over residents \nand/or businesses, or entities that work on behalf of locally elected representatives (not state, \nprovincial or federal governments).826  \nBusiness Recognition: \nThe Recognition Program is designed to recognise communities that have a Zero Waste goal and have \nreduced or are working towards reducing their waste disposal by landfilling and dincineration by 90% \nor more. As with communities there are a number of other specific requirements for recognition.  \nEligible businesses are institutions (including schools, colleges, universities, hospitals, prisons and \nother government facilities), commercials, industries (including manufacturing), venues and events \nand non-governmental organizations and Social Enterprises.827  \nBoth recognition programs apply the \u201cZero Waste Hierarchy\u201d which is a more differentiated version of \nthe internationally commonly referred 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). 828 \nInstitutions, review and decision-making \nInstitutions : ZWIA consists out of different civil society and business organisations, foundations, cities \nand experts around the globe. ZWIA is led by a Board of Directors. \nEvaluation and review: No information available. \n \n825 http://zwia.org/aboutus/. \n826 http://zwia.org/community-recognition/. \n827 http://zwia.org/standards/zw-business-principles/b/. \n828 http://zwia.org/standards/zero-waste-hierarchy/. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n209 Reporting: No reporting required apart from those specified for businesses and communities (see \nabove). \nCompliance procedures, remedies and dispute settlement procedures: No information available.  \nStakeholder and public involvement: Being largely a civil society network ZWIA\u2019s work is based on \nworking with stakeholders and public involvement. \nAssessment \nCoherence with other international treaties and policies: There is a strong link to the EU\u00b4s circular \neconomy package.  \nDiffusion:  ZWIA is essentially global. Nevertheless, membership and degree of activity is distributed \nunevenly.829 The strongest regional organisation seems to be Zero Waste Europe with 232 Zero Waste \nCities and about 25 Zero Waste businesses.830  \nEffectiveness: Pursuing the the aim of zero waste can be regarded as highly significant for resource \nefficiency. The effectiveness of ZWIA depends, however, on the progess reached. As mentioned before, \nthere are 232 Zero Waste Cities in Italy but only one in the UK and zero in Germany.831 No data could \nbe found on the progress towards reducing landfilling and incineration by the members of ZWIA. \nPolitical opportunities and good practice examples:  \nOpportunities for improving the instrument regarding resource efficiency:  \n\u25ba No data about a planned revision or the like could be found. \nGood practice examples: \n\u25ba ZWIA takes a holistic view on resource efficiency addressing different stages of production \nand consumption (product design, consumer choices, waste management etc.) as well as \ndifferent actors (business, municipalities, consumers). \n\u25ba Designation of \u201cBest practice municipalities\u201d by Zero Waste Europe awarded to cities with \nper capita residual waste less than 75kg per year.832 \n \n2.3.8 Assessment of non-state governance approaches \nThe relevance for resource efficiency  of the non-state government approaches differs considerably. \nWhile some will only have indirect effects, others impact resource use directly. Reporting standards \nlike the GRI or the KPIs for ESG might have indirect effects by making resource use by companies \ntransparent. The same can be said for LCAs on a product level. Other standards use targets to generate \na direct impact. E.g. EMAS\u2019 requirement to set specific targets on resource consumption will support \ncompanies in reducing the use of resources when applying the management system. Another initiative \nwhich provides specific targets regarding resource efficiency is the Zero Waste International Alliance. \nType I eco-labels as well as the GRS have direct impact by certifying certain aspects of resource \nefficiency for specific products. \nRegarding the institutional setting , most of the initiatives are based on multi-stakeholder networkd \nand include actors from business, civil society or other institutions like standard setting agencies. The \n \n829 http://zwia.org/links/. \n830 https://www.zerowasteeurope.eu/. \n831 Zero Waste Europe (n.d.). \n832 http://zerowasteeurope.eu/zerowastecities.eu/. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n210 degree of influence among the groups, however, differs considerably, businesses being the most \ninfluential stakeholder in many cases. In some cases, state actors also play a relevant role in \nsupporting the creation as well as the diffusion of the respective initiative. \nThe addressees  of most of the analysed initiatives are companies. The instruments either refer to \ncorporate processes/ management or to companies\u2019 products and services. The ZWIA is an exception \nbecause it also addresses municipalities and the civil society. \nIn terms of steering mechanism , all initiatives apply information tools. Additionally, capacity building \nor cooperative instruments are used by some.  \nNearly all of the initiatives have review processes  for their standards in place. In the case of the GRI \nor the German eco-label \u201cBlauer Engel\u201d, these are highly formalized and standardised mechanisms \nwith clearly defined time frames and specific institutions assigned with the implementation of the \nreview. In most other cases, review proesses are more informal. \nThe degree of diffusion  differs strongly between the standards and initiatives. While some initiatives, \nsuch as the GRI, have managed to become globally applied standards that set a benchmark even \nthough they are voluntary in nature, others (like the GRS or GeSI) are limited in their geographical or \nsectoral application and therefore impact. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 211 \n 2.4 Overarching assessement  \nBinding international law and emerging principles  and concepts analysed in this study for the \nmost part do not address resource efficiency directly in terms of resources used per unit of output. \nThere are a few general references to efficiency in bilateral resource treaties and the seabed regime, \nbut so far they have been more focused on facilitating extraction and allocating the resources. In \ncontrast, some non-binding mechanisms and non-state governance approaches address resource \nefficiency directly.  \nIndirectly, binding international law provides a range of incentives to improve resource efficiency. The \nmost relevant links in binding instruments are resource conservation aspects and treaties concerning \nwaste. Both resource conservation and recovery are inherent parts of the circular economy of wastes. \nRegulatory approaches that involved direct market interventions, such as the tin agreement, have \nbeen abandoned. Indirect links in customary international law and emerging or proposed principles \nare difficult to ascertain because their legal status, normative content, or both are often not \nestablished, unclear or abstract. They could serve as a counterweight to the sovereign right to exploit \nnatural resources, and there could be political opportunities to use them to interpret existing norms \nwith regard to resource efficiency. It remains to be seen whether the rationale behind concepts such as \n\"safe operating space\" and \"planetary boundaries\", which have found their way e.g. into the EU's \ncircular economy policy,833 can feed into further developing existing legal principles and rules at the \ninternational level.834  \nAs for the political processes and non-binding mechanisms  screened, the most widespread \nmechanism is recommendations, often in the form of high-level political statements with strategic \npriorities and guidance, which are frequently accompanied by joint frameworks of action. These range \nfrom G7/ G8- via OECD- to UN-wide commitments such as the SDGs and New Urban Agenda. In \naddition, there are several relevant programmes by international organisations, most notably, UNEP, \ntargeted towards increasing resource efficiency, a science-policy interface (IRP) and project lending \nstandards by the World Bank Group that address, among others, resource efficiency. Many of the \ninstruments are relatively unspecific, have only moderate political output and feature insignificant \ninstitutional embedding and international budgets. An exception is the SDGs which specify resource \nefficiency goals and (abstract) targets, combined with a political monitoring mechanism. At least at \npresent, they also have political weight and momentum and appear to be the instrument with the best \nprerequisites to induce change in political practices. The newly established G20\u2019s dialogue could also \nprovide political opportunities.  \nNon-state governance approaches  include mainly reporting and other information and management \ntools regarding products and production processes. Their steering impact is mainly based on informal \nmarket incentives, i.e. to provide the company in question with a competitive advantage by making it \nor its products more attractive for investors, consumers etc. Several include reporting requirements \non the use of resources or resource efficiency in a general manner, while others address either overall \nenvironmental impacts or the type and total amount of resources used. Product certification schemes \ncan involve criteria that are directly linked to resource efficiency like longevity or repairability.  \nInternational law mostly addresses either the whole value chain  in a general manner, or specifically \nits beginning (extraction) or end (waste). Most of the non-binding instruments address the complete \nvalue chain, although a few are focused on extraction, others on waste and the 3Rs \u201creduce, reuse and \nrecycle\u201d. Several non-state governance approaches address specific products or production processes. \n \n833 COM(2020) 98 of 11.03.2020, \"A new Circular Economy Action Plan For a cleaner and more \ncompetitive Europe, at 18. \n834 For a critical view see M\u00fcller et al (2017). FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 212 \n From an institutional perspective , some institutions have the potential to address resource \nefficiency directly or indirectly. The COPs of several MEAs may include resource efficiency in their \nagenda, and the International Seabed Authority provides for a strict extraction management of mineral \nresources in the deep seabed that may provide incentives to use resources more efficiently. The World \nBank\u2019s Environmental and Social Standards and the IFC\u2019s performance standards include resource \nefficiency in a general manner and subject to a number of caveats such as technical and financial \nfeasibility. They are a special case as they are binding insofar as they form part of the loan agreements \nwith the borrowers. \nThe stocktake provides a mixed picture : There are virtually no binding standards for resource \nefficiency. One reason might be that so far states found it easier to agree on environmental obligations \nand restrict their sovereignty and with regard to traditional environmental impacts. The \nenvironmental impacts of inefficiency are caused less directly than \u201cusual\u201d environmental impacts and \ndifficult to ascertain. Another aspect could be that resource efficiency brings environmental concerns \nto process and product standards and competitiveness, an issue which is addressed by international \ntrade rules. The WTO system, which is not specifically addressed in this study, has rules on process \nand product standards, although these do not require resource efficiency but instead determine to \nwhat extent states may be permitted  to require such standards. States might be reluctant to consider \nbinding rules in this area in order to avoid problems with trade rules. A further impediment could be \nthat resource efficiency standards, unless they remain fairly abstract, would entail technical \nrequirements that are highly specific to individual production processes and would therefore be \ndifficult to negotiate as well as to keep up to date. While at first sight non-binding and other \napproaches are more specific, they are mostly reporting and management tools with varying degrees \nof specificity regarding resource use. Even in this area, few non-state standards specifically address \nresource efficiency in the sense of actually quantifying a permitted amount of material per output. \nOn the other hand, recent non-binding approaches show that resource efficiency has been included on \nthe international political agenda . The SDGs and the G20 are different process but both high-level \nand with political weight and legitimacy. Although in the past, both processes (or, in the case of the \nSDGs, their predecessors) had in some cases problems with sustaining political momentum and \nachieving concrete results, with regard to resource efficiency they are both in relatively early stages \nwith potential political opportunities.  \nThere is no clear link or discernible deliberate division of labour between binding and non-\nbinding or other approaches . So far neither non-binding political initiatives nor other non-state and \napproaches relating to resource efficiency appear to have spurred the development of binding \nobligations. However, this does not exclude from the outset that existing non-binding approaches \ncould be used to either build political will in this regard, show feasibility or serve as a model. \nThese considerations will have to be taken into account when developing policy recommendations in \nthe following section. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 213 \n 3 Further Development of the Current Framework \n3.1 Assessment of governance proposals in academic literature \nThe following section assesses proposals in academic literature for a better governance of resource \nefficiency. It follows the structure of the stocktake in Section 2.The methodology used for this section \nis described in the Section 1.3, but some aspects, particularly concerning scope, are presented in the \nintroductory part of the relevant subsections.  \n3.1.1 Governance proposals related to international law: A new treaty? \nResearch for this sub-section indicated that in the literature on international law, there seem to be \nalmost no concrete proposals for addressing and increasing resource efficiency at the international \nlevel. Therefore this section focuses on an international treaty for sustainable resource \nmanagement .  \nDescription : Apparently, only Bleischwitz (2009)835 presented a comprehensive proposal for an \ninternational treaty related to resource efficiency, to which he also referred in other publications.836 \nSuch a convention would be part of a governance system at the international level that would also \ncomprises institutional elements. The aim of the treaty would be to establish sustainable resource \nmanagement as well as principles of resource conservation. In this concept, resources are generally \naddressed as raw materials or commodities837 and apparently focus on abiotic resources.838 \u201cBasic \nlegal principles\u201d for sustainable resource management would include the principle of common \nheritage of mankind839 and the \u201cprinciple of material stewardship\u201d. By the latter principle Bleischwitz \nmeans the optimal and adequate extraction, production and use of resources for the benefit of society \nwhile respecting the environment, thereby creating an obligation for states, companies and consumers \nto use resources sustainably and to avoid material waste.840 In legal terms, resources would be \ntransformed into a common good.841 Other elements of the proposal include improving the \ninformation basis (especially through an international databank), economic incentives (especially \nfiscal incentives through taxation), promoting bilateral programmes and agreements, institutionalizing \nfurther negotiation processes, and possibly compensation mechanisms for developing countries with \nan environmentally-intensive resource extraction and processing industry. Regarding the timeline, \nBleischwitz emphasises that such a treaty could only be established stepwise, and that it would need \nto include industry.  \nAssessment:  According to Bleischwitz there is sufficient pressure for political action since the \navailability of raw materials is limited in times of increasing global demand, and thus increasing \ncompetition will lead to rising costs in the long run.842 In our view, however, for the time being these \nfactors do not appear to create political momentum towards a legally binding instrument. For \nexample, some of the relevant commodity prices have considerably decreased compared to five years \nago.843  \nBleischwitz\u2019 proposal includes some interesting concepts such as principles of resource conservation, \nimproving the data base, economic incentives, the involvement of the industry, financial and other \n \n835 Bleischwitz (2009), at 147 et seq. \n836 E.g. Bleischwitz (2011), at 408; Bleischwitz et al.

FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 214 \n support for developing countries with an environmentally-intensive resource extraction and \nprocessing industry. However, some of these elements remain fairly general, while for others the \nspecifics provided do not appear convincing. In particular, international legal provisions on a resource \ntax do not seem to be a realistic financial incentive. Moreover, the concept as whole amounts to an \nextraordinary dirigiste governance of resources that are turned into common goods. \nBleischwitz concedes that currently, and in contrast to international climate change law, quantitative \nrequirements for resource conservation or efficiency do not appear to be feasible. This makes it \ndifficult, for the time being, to identify viable elements of an international treaty. Agreeing on mere \nqualitative requirements, e.g. in the form of general principles, would arguably need to be backed up \nby effective economic incentives which, however, are not easy to identify. Moreover, it is questionable \nwhether limiting the content of a resource treaty to elements such as improvement of the data base \nand information exchange would be sufficient to create political buy-in for an international treaty on \nresource efficiency.844 \nGenerally, however, the idea of general, not too prescriptive treaty could make sense. Although \nresource efficiency is a widely accepted objective, there is a difference between being politically \nsupportive and becoming party to a binding instrument. Similar to the concept of a \u201cframework \nconvention\u201d in the climate regime, the framework nature of a treaty could help bringing states on \nboard. Such a treaty could include general duties to increase resource efficiency and refer to the global \nbenefits of resource efficiency, e.g. its indirect effects on climate change mitigation. \nLevers for resource efficiency:  A treaty would address those states who chose to ratifiy it (plus the EU). \nSubject to specific content, it would overarching, cross-cutting.  \n \n \n3.1.2 Governance proposals related to international political processes and non-binding \nmechanisms  \nIn the following, we present a number of proposals and recommendations for international political \nprocesses and non-binding aiming to foster resource efficiency. To identify the proposals, we carried \nout a screening of websites, papers, reports and newsletters and then followed a \u2018snowball systems\u2019.845 \nIn the search, keywords such as \u2018resource efficiency\u2019, \u2018resource productivity\u2019, \u2018material productivity\u2019, \n\u2018material efficiency\u2019, \u2018circular economy\u2019, \u2018decoupling\u2019 and \u20183R\u2019 were taken into account.  \nMany relevant actors make proposals on how to promote efficiency with regard to abiotic resources at \nthe sectoral or national level but they rarely advocate an anchoring of resource efficiency policies at \nthe international level.

This proposal mainly refers to critical materials, \nnamely phosphorus, coltan, rare earth elements, platinum group metals and copper.847 \nAssessment : The political viability of a Multistakeholder Forum depends on the economic and/ or \npolitical weigh of the involved stakeholders, on the practical commitments that the stakeholders \nsubject to and thus on the dynamics that unfold within (and possibly outside) the forum. \nIn 2017, the German G20 presidency was able to start a dialogue on resource efficiency at the political \nlevel. It remains to be seen whether this could serve as a long-term international resource forum as \nproposed by Bleischwitz.  \nThe establishment of an International Multistakeholder Forum could be carried out in the short-term \nfuture. \nFunding a Multistakeholder Forum would require covering the costs of participating public actors and \nof civil society organisations (which could otherwise be underrepresented, due to lacking funds). \nIndustry stakeholders would fund their participation themselves. All paying partners would fund a \nsecretariat structure and a budget for programme activities. Costs would vary in accordance with the \nnumber of (non-industry) participants and the ambitiousness of the programme of work. \nLevers for resource efficiency : An International Multistakeholder Forum would serve to exchange \nopinions and best practice as well as to diffuse innovative solutions (e.g., for \u201cintegrating resource \nefficiency into product development\u201d), thus addressing (at least) the lever of \u201cstrengthening research \nand improving the science basis; transfer of technology and knowledge and creating awareness\u201d. \nDepending on the mandate that the forum would develop for itself, the stakeholders could work \ntogether to \u201cexpand a resource efficient circular economy\u201d, for instance by developing solutions for \n\u201coptimizing the collection and recycling of resource-relevant bulk wastes\u201d across borders or by \n\u201cpromoting recovery structures in developing countries and emerging economies\u201d. In addition, a \nstakeholder forum might help to \u201cboost resource efficiency in production\u201d, when its industry \nstakeholders use the forum to transnationally cooperate on the \u201cdevelopment and diffusion of \nresource- and energy-efficient production and handling processes\u201d.  \n \n \n846 Bleischwitz (et al. 2012) at 60. \n847 Bleischwitz (et al. 2012) at 10.

EU Horizon 2020 project \u201cFORAM: Towards a World \nForum on Raw Materials\u201d \nProposal: The FORAM project is a two-year project that was launched in November 2016, led by the \nWorld Resources Forum Association based in Switzerland and funded by the European Union\u2019s \nHorizon 2020 research and innovation programme. FORAM is claimed to function as a platform for the \nexchange between international experts and stakeholders related to raw materials and resource \nefficiency.  \nWhile the Forum in principle covers all raw materials, its focus is on mining materials. The forum is \nmade up by twelve core partners. Participants of FORAM\u2019s Stakeholder Panel represent a relevant part \nof the entire raw material value chain, however, main part covers mining, processing and recycling \npart.848 Stakeholders range from the mining and transportation sector to consultancies and the \nrecycling industry. To date, however, representatives from the mining sectors predominate. There are \nno civil society actors in the core team, among the \u2018third parties\u2019 of the Forum or on the advisory board \nof the project. The project seeks to engage the participation of G20 Member countries. \nFORAM aims to improve international collaboration on raw material policies and investments, as well \nas international resource transparency and governance, with ultimate goal being stability, \npredictability and resource-efficiency related to raw material management. Moreover, the project aims \nat contributing to policy and governance recommendations on an international scale.849 \nAssessment : According to the project initiators, this project will be the largest cooperation on a global \nscale that is carried out. Moreover, it aims at making the entire resource supply chain more \ntransparent, resource-efficient and less complex. However, as the forum is bound to the project\u00b4s \nduration, it is unclear whether it could continue in the context of another project or otherwise. Finally, \nits political effectiveness may depend on its ability to establish sound links to the beginning G 20 \ndialogue on resource efficiency. \nSince the project was already launched (in November 2016) and is supposed to last two years; \nestablishing a World Forum on Raw Materials will be carried out in the short term future.  \nThe FORAM project is funded by the European Union\u2019s \u201cHorizon 2020\u201d research and innovation \nprogramme under Grant Agreement No 730127.  \nLevers for resource efficiency : Creating a World Forum on Raw Materials will address primarily the \nlever of \u201cstrengthening research and improving the science basis; transfer of knowledge\u201d. \n \n3.1.2.3 International data hub \nProposal: An international data hub on sustainable resource management is suggested by academics to \nprovide information related to the entire supply chain and life span of resources.850 The data hub could \ncontain information about harmonized, open-access geological data; geo-spatial data; data on critical \nmaterials and the resource nexus on the use of resources in economies and across industries; basic \nsocio-economic data; environmental impacts of key materials and agricultural goods; as well as key \ndata for scenario analysis about future use.851 Another group of scientists suggest the data hub focuses \non global material flows and resource productivity.852 \n \n848 FORAM (2017) at 2. \n849 FORAM, Project, available at http://www.foramproject.net/index.php/project/.   \n850 Bleischwitz et al.

(2016) at 19. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 217 \n The data hub could be established in collaboration with already existing agencies and mechanisms and \ntools, such as the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), geological surveys, the IRP and tools \nsuch as the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).853 It might draw on already existing datasets, \nsuch as Eurostat data on trade in raw materials, the Eurostat Data Centre for Waste and the OECD \ndatabase on material flows.  \nThe Enquete-Commission of the German Parliament on \u201cGrowth, welfare and quality of life\u201d \n(Wachstum, Wohlstand, Lebensqualit\u00e4t; 2011-2013) aimed for an improved global governance \nstructure in the trading of resources and supports the idea of establishing an international metal or \nresource forum. In this forum, geological services from various countries could cooperate in order to \nachieve more transparency and geological data related to resource management. According to the \nEnquete-Commission, the International Energy Forum or the International Renewable Energy Agency \n(IRENA) could function as examples for managing resources on an international scale. 854  \nAssessment : An international data hub can help to draw a picture about current resource use and \nallow building scenarios about future resource use. It may thus inform international or national-level \npolicy-making with regard to resource efficiency. However, it does not directly address (regulate, \nincentivize etc.) changes in the behaviour of mining companies, producers, the recycling industries, let \nalone consumers. Its effectiveness will depend on the availability, costs and subsequent usage (for \npolicy-making purposes) of relevant data. \nWhen considering the establishment of a data hub, it needs to be taken into account that in November \n2017 the \u201cInternational Raw Materials Observatory\u201d (IRMO) was launched. The IRMO is an \nindependent entity that functions as a knowledge management infrastructure focused on raw \nmaterials. It provides a database on cooperation opportunities between the EU and international \ncooperation countries and addresses, inter alia, raw material policies and strategies and exploration, \nextraction, processing and recycling practices.855 To date, the IRMO has no focus on resource \nefficiency. \nSince the idea of establishing an international data hub can draw on already existing datasets, an \ninternational data hub can be carried out in the short term future.  \nCosts for an international data hub will correlate with the kind of required data and the desired scope \nthat the data should cover. Some form of secretariat would need to be financed, too. \nLevers for resource efficiency : Creating a World Forum on Raw Materials will address the lever of \n\u201cincreasing transparency in supply chain, strengthening research and improving the science basis; \ntransfer of knowledge\u201d. \n \n3.1.2.4 Intergovernmental Panel on Sustainable Resource Management \nProposal: Based on the observation that a better scientific observation and politics is necessary, the \nGerman Advisory Council on the Environment (SRU) suggests establishing an Intergovernmental Panel \non Sustainable Resource Management (IPSRM). This is also suggested by Bleischwitz (2009, 2015).  \nAccording to the SRU, an intergovernmental platform that brings together international political actors \nwith scientists is needed in order to reduce negative environmental impacts of resource extraction, its \nproduction, usage and disposal on a global scale. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n(IPCC) is claimed both by the SRU and Bleischwitz856 to serve as a good practice example for \nestablishing a Resource Panel: It brings together current knowledge of a large number of scientists \n \n853 Bleischwitz et al. (2012) at 59. \n854 Enquete-Commission (2011) at 513. \n855 Intraw Project, available at http://intraw.eu/.  \n856 Bleischwitz (2009) at 152; Bleischwitz (2015) at 19. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 218 \n about climate change and connects it with international environmental politics via regularly published \nreports and the identification of possible action. The SRU acknowledges that the already existing \nInternational Resource Panel under the aegis of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) \nfulfils some of the suggested functions of an IPSRM. However, according to the SRU it lacks financial \nand human equipment, intergovernmental political connections and institutionalized anchoring.857  \nThe proposal of establishing an IPSRM refers to the management of metallic and mineral resources.  \nAssessment : Platforms like the IPCC or the IPBES already exist and can function as an example. They \nshow that the political viability of establishing a science-policy interface can be high.  \nTaking the IPCC as a leading example, the establishing of an IPSRM will have a high effectiveness. For \ninstance, without the regularly report of the IPCC, an international consensus about the 2degree limit \nfor fighting global warming would not have been reached. However, existing platforms are linked to an \ninternational political process \u2013 the UNFCCC and CBD processes, respectively \u2013, and their political \nviability is rooted in their role within these regimes. An IPSRM would be a stand-alone institution, not \nlinked to any existing international processes. It is hence not obvious that it could unfold a similar \npolitical clout and policy-making support as the existing examples. \nIn addition, the analogy to the IPCC appears to be valid only to a small extent. It is true that the IRP has \nsome potential to provide important impetus similar to the IPCC, e.g. through its report on Global \nAssessment on Natural Resources Use and Management, which is envisaged for 2019 and regularly \nevery two or four years thereafter. On the other hand, the IPCC has much more solid foundations and \nis firmly linked to other institutions. Moreover, its results have a higher legitimacy due to broader \ninvolvement of experts nominated by the states and process standards: the IPCC drafts its reports \nfollowing an elaborated international procedure for the selection of hundreds of researchers who \nanalyse the relevant literature worldwide and review the drafts in extensive public and political \nconsultations. Furthermore, the IPCC is legally rooted in international climate change law and partially \nvested with normative powers. It is up for debate whether the IRP could and should assume a \ncomparable role. The recent example of the IPBES for biodiversity should be taken into account, which \nwas conceived following the role model of the IPCC. \nThe establishment of an IPSRM could be carried out in the medium term future, building on the \nalready existing structure of the IRP.  \nLaunching a science-policy-interface in the dimensions of an IPCC or even IPBES is linked to a \nconsiderable amount of costs. Even when deducting the operational costs of the IRP, which could then \nbe replaced, the higher amount of scientists would involve a more complex mode of writing \nassessments, presumably with more physical meetings and more participants. Also, the support \ninfrastructure would probably need to be increased. \nLooking at existing science-policy interfaces, the IPCC is financed by voluntary contributions of few \nMember Countries to a Trust Fund,858 while scientists that contribute to the work of the IPCC work on \na voluntary basis, sometimes traveling expenses to editorial meetings are reimbursed by the IPCC \nfund.859 The seat of the IPCC is at the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva, while the different \ntechnical support units are located in various member countries and financed by them.860 \nLevers for resource efficiency : An IPSRM would address the lever of \u201cstrengthening research and \nimproving the science basis; transfer of knowledge\u201d.

It is not specified what kind of data the agency would collate and \nhow exactly the data would further increases in resource efficiency.The agency could improve \ndissemination and learning through coordinated programmes of awareness-raising and training \ncourses.862The Agency could also serve as the secretary of the international multistakeholder forum \npresented above (Section 3.1) .863 This proposal mainly refers to the management of critical materials, \nnamely phosphorus, coltan, rare earth elements, platinum group metals and copper.   \nThe German Advisory Council on the Environment (SRU) supports the idea of establishing an \ninternational Resource Management Agency as well. According to the SRU, the agency could function \nas a central node that gathers, stores and processes data and information about extraction sites, \nextraction conditions and environmental impact .864 According to the SRU, the international Resource \nManagement Agency should manage metallic and mineral resources.  \nThe Enquete-Commission of the German Parliament on \u201cGrowth, welfare and quality of life\u201d also \nmentioned the establishment of an International Resource Agency under the aegis of the United \nNations. However, it does not evaluate or detail this idea .865 The Enquete-Comission did not specify \nwhich specific resources the Agency should manage.  \nAssessment : The tasks of an International Resource Management Agency as proposed by Bleischwitz \ninclude in the first place the task of a central information desk similar to IRENA. It is questionable \nwhether such an agency would provide added value compared to other relevant institutions which \nalready exist or are proposed as well: The IRP could provide for the scientific foundations and data, \nand there are also proposals for an international data center for the resource intensity of products and \nservices in order to enable the sustainable management of international substance flows in support \nchains (see above).866 In addition, multiple multilateral institutions already provide support through \nknowledge, capacity building, technology and finance. Finally, a modern international treaty would \nnormally create its own institutions. Launching an International Resource Management Agency would \nrequire achieving consensus on the need for such an agency among a sufficient number of countries \nwilling to finance the organisation. It could probably be carried out only in the medium term future. \nIn order to (roughly) estimate the costs related to establishing an International Resource Management \nAgency, we can look at the IEA as an example: The IEA is funded by its 29 member countries and the \nrevenue it generates from its publications. Its 2016 budget amounted to some 27 mio Euro. IEA \nmember countries pay assessed contributions, calculated with a formula that takes account of the size \nof each member's economy, and additional voluntary contributions Countries. In 2015, 29% of IEA\u2019s \nspending was based on voluntary contributions .867  \n \n861 Bleischwitz (2009) and (2013); Bleischwitz et al. (2012). \n862 Bleischwitz et al.

The search which included the \nscreening of websites, papers, reports and newsletters focused on the different \u201cinstruments\u201d \nidentified in AP 1: reporting requirements for companies, environmental management systems, \nproducts environmental impact assessment, (eco) labels, recycling and waste related initiatives.868  \nThe different actors whose websites and / or publications we screened include the following: \n\u25ba non-financial reporting requirements:  SSE (Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative), \nIntegrated Reporting, Project Delphi, Global Sustainable Investment Alliance. \n\u25ba environmental management systems:  European Commission (Eco-Management and \nAudit Scheme), EMSA (Environmental Management Network) \n\u25ba products environmental impact assessment:  European Commission (Single Market for \nGreen Products Initiative)869, American Center for Life Cycle Assessment (ACLCA), SETAC \n(Life Cycle Assessment Interest Group) plus a number of other industry specific \nassociations. \n\u25ba (eco) labels: GEN (Global Ecolabelling Network),870 OECD 2002  \n\u25ba recycling and waste related initiatives:  Business Europe (Circular Economy)  \n \n3.1.3.1 Mandatory Reporting on R-KPIs (resource efficiency Key Performance Indicators)  \nProposal: Scientists propose the introduction of mandatory reporting requirements on key \nperformance indicators relevant to resource efficiency (R-KPIs).871 They also mention (international) \nframeworks.872 However, this part of the proposals remains unsubstantiated. The more substantial \nideas put forward address national legislation or non-binding frameworks like GRI. The International \nFinancial Reporting Standard \u2013 which is legally binding in the EU \u2013 is mentioned as well. The proposal \nalso points at the issue of enforcement and suggests governmental as well as private controls (audits). \nAssessment : No direct conclusions can be drawn from the proposal. Overall it must be said, that while \nthe question of content and economic rationale is addressed quite in detail. The issue of political \nimplementation, especially at the international level, is only hinted at briefly. \nNo time frame is mentioned in the proposal. \nThe incurring costs for the companies are roughly estimated, although the given data refers to non-\nfinancial reporting in general not specifically to the requirements of resource efficiency related data \ncollection. \n \n868 Since the screening conducted in Section 3 also covered international non-state governance approaches a search using the \nsame keywords and looking at the same institutions was not reproduced here. \n869 On the webpage it is stated that the European Commission \u201csupports international efforts towards more coordination in \nmethodological development and data availability\u201d (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/smgp/index.htm) However, \nthis is not regarded as a sufficiently substantiated proposal to be further analyzed. \n870 Scientific papers such as Bonsi et al. (2008) and Lind (1996) tend to focus on compatibility with international trade law. \n871 Bienge, Berg (2015). \n872 Bienge, Berg (2015) at 9-10. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 221 \n Levers for resource efficiency : The idea is that R-KPIs would show resource related chances and risks, \ninefficiencies and resource consumption for the individual company, giving the opportunity for \nimproved strategic management.873 \n3.1.3.2 International Metal Covenant for the Automotive Industry  \nDescription : Another proposal is an \u201cinternational metal covenant\u201d between key car manufacturers \nand suppliers, the recycling industry and the competent authorities in major export and destination \ncountries. The aim of such a covenant is the establishment of long-term resource efficiency goals \nthrough a high-quality recycling market. This would imply that industrial enterprises and their \nassociations commit themselves to resource protection goals, while the states ensure \u201ca stable and \nsupportive environment for the agreed terms\u201d. In contrast to non-binding commitments, the covernant \nshould provide for effective dispute resolution and sanctions, and be enforceable in court.874  \nAssessment : There are no examples of an international treaty between several states and industry \nsectors, only sectoral agreements at national level, most of them non-binding.875 \nLegally, this proposal would be similar to an investment agreement between states and enterprises as \nnon-state actors. It is likely to pose the same legal, political and substantive problems.876 This is \nparticularly the case for the proposed enforceability in court, especially if several states should be \ninvolved. Politically, the proposal would require huge efforts, since achieving a novel form of contract \nat the international level with so many different players is a particularly ambitious task. \nLevers for resource efficiency : An international metal covenant for the automotive industry would \naddress the levers \u201coptimization of the collection and recycling of relevant wastes\u201d and \u201cprevent illegal \nwaste exports, promote recovery structures in emerging and developing countries\u201d.  \n \n3.2 Policy options and recommendations \n3.2.1 Strengthening resource efficiency in international law \n3.2.1.1 Work towards a treaty on resource efficiency in the medium to long term \nWe do not recommend pursuing a new standalone treaty on RE at this stage, even if it was merely a \ngeneral framework treaty.  \nMid-to long-term: Under these circumstances, one option is to work towards creating more political buy-\nin for a new treaty. The discussion in the context of international fora such as the G7 Alliance for \nResource Efficiency, G20 Dialogue on Resource Efficiency, the OECD etc. should gradually be brought to \nconsider an international RE treaty, for instance in the form of a general framework treaty. Besides a \nstand-alone treaty, there is also the option of a new instrument under an existing treaty (e.g. a \n\u201cProtocol\u201d). \nPotentially Long-term: In order to be prepared in the long run, we provide an outline of potential treaty \nprovisions as food for thought in Annex 2. \nDescription : The political effort that required at this stage to create support for and start negotiations \non a treaty appears substantial in terms of lobbying and building coalitions. There is some political \nmomentum for it in the G7 or G20, but for the short term the political effort required seems out of \nproportion to the potential gain. This would also be the case even if the envisaged treaty would just be \na framework with little detail in its obligations.  \n \n873 Bienge, Berg (2015) at 7-10. \n874 Bleischwitz (2012) at 63; Wilts, Bleischwitz and Sanden (2010) at 80-91; see also Bleischwitz (2010) at 227-244. \n875 Wiltd, Bleischwitz and Sanden (2010) at 49-51. \n876 For details see Vi \u00f1uales (2016). FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 222 \n However, since a treaty on RE is one of Germany\u2019s long-term strategic objective, one option is to work \ntowards creating the political conditions and right moment for a new treaty. Germany could \nstrategically invest political capital in keeping the issue on the agenda and probing the possibility of \ndiscussing a treaty and starting an international negotiating process. It should regularly re-assess the \nprogress of its own agenda-setting efforts and of RE generally. For instance, the G7 and G20 efforts \nmight lead to better understanding of tools and options for RE and prepare political opportunities for \ninternational cooperation in binding form. Creating the opportunity and right moment is not always \npredictable. For instance, based on a French initiative for a new global instrument, a \"Global Pact for \nthe Environment\", the UN General Assembly started a process for identifying gaps in international \nenvironmental law and for a round of negotiations to consider a potential international instrument to \naddress them.877 The French government supported a treaty at the highest level, promoted the treaty \nat the UN and gained the support of the UN Secretary-General.878 However, the negotiations indicated \na significant reluctance of state to work towards a new binding instrument. The recommendations to \nthe General Assembly of May 2019 merely envisage a mandate to the 5th UN Environment Assembly in \n2021 to prepare a draft \"political declaration\".879 Besides concerns about legal form generally, the \nrecommendations are quite vague and initial ideas for addressing resource eficiency were dropped \ncompletely. It remains to be seen whether it will be brought back in in the follow-up process towards a \npolitical declaration.  \nIf and when there is political momentum or the right moment, the German government should also be \nable as well as prepared to use it. Since RE encompasses a broad range resources and diverse \napproaches, it could be useful to consider starting with a framework structure that envisages \nsubsequent amendments for particular resources or issues, e.g. in annexes or protocols. With regard to \npolitical feasbility, it should be noted that a treaty can address different issues differently, more or less \nprescriptively and precisely, and it can leave flexibility for parties in order to facilitate buy-in and \nimplementation over time. It could include mandates for further work and permanent institutions \nsuch as a usual Conference of Parties (COP) which adopts decisions to specify and guide parties' \nimplementation over time. We provide a potential draft of treaty provisions as food for thought in an \nannex below.  \nIn line with its framework nature, the treaty's objective could be broad and be based on existing \npolitical agreements such as the SDGs. A question for future discussion would be to what extent a \ntreaty on RE could include targets and indicators.  \nApart from an overarching treaty on resource efficiency, another option is to support initiatives for \nbinding rules for particular issues that are related to resource efficiency, such as an instrument to \naddress plastics generally or marine plastics litter. Germany would also have to take into account the \nrole of the EU not only politically, but also legally if and when it comes to actual negotiations: Since the \ntreaty would in all likelihood at least partly fall within the EU\u2019s shared competence, Germany would \nnot be free in acting at the international level and would instead have to act through a coordinated EU \nposition. \nLevers for resource efficiency : A treaty would address states (and the EU) who would have to \nimplement its obligations in their respective national jurisdictions. Depending on the treaty\u2019s specific \ncontent, it would be overarching and cross-cutting, with genral obligations that could be elaborated \nover time in annexes for specific sectors, resources etc.  \n \n3.2.1.2 Interpret the polluter pays principle and existing customary law in terms of resource efficiency \nLong-term: Germany could work towards establishing and interpreting existing customary law in a way \nthat includes aspects of RE. For instance, it could develop and support an expanded legal interpretation \n \n877 UN GA resolution 72/A/L.52 of 07.05.2018.

Instead, similar to other principles of international \nenvironmental law, Germany could seek to establish a general notion of RE. \nIn general, customary law requires two elements state practice and corresponding acceptance as law. \nIf Germany wanted to promote and eventually establish a new principle of resource efficiency as \ncustomary law, we would recommend developing and sticking to a specific wording in order to \nfacilitate both elements. The approach we recommend instead is to build on existing principles of \ninternational law. Germany would seek to promote and establish that an existing principle of \ninternational law, e.g. the polluter pays principle, includes aspects of RE. It would have to state its view \nin official statements, negotiating positions etc, and to try to include it in international documents such \nas declarations, resolutions, outcome documents etc. This approach could be less difficult politically \nand legally than establishing a new legal principle, because it could focus on interpreting the content of \nan existing principle, rather than meeting the requirements for establishing legal status and content of \na new principle from scratch. In addition, promoting a certain interpretation provides additional \nflexibility compared to a establishing a new principle.  \nIf successful, this could be a basis on which to build internationally as well as domestically. Once \nestablished or at least recognised as emerging, the impact of a legal principle would be long-term and \ncould justify, support and shape future (national as well as international) policies and actions. \nHowever, even though it could be less difficult than establishing a new principle, establishing a specific \ninterpretation of an existing customary law also requires a long-term, strategic political effort. \nGermany would have to assess the implications of this approach in relation to its overall position on \ninternational environmental law and agree internally on pursuing it. It would then need to sustain its \npolitical will as well its efforts at the international level over a long period of time. It would have to \nstate and gain support and allies for its legal view. It would also have to support its view, at least to \nsome extent, by its own practice, in order to be credible.  \nIn terms of content, Germany would need to decide whether to pursue an interpretation that \naddresses RE generally, or specific aspects or resources, e.g. abiotic resources. One particular aspect \ncould be the notion of saving resources in order to keep development sustainable for future \ngenerations.  \nWith regard to which existing principle to build on, the polluter pays principle  would be the \nrecommended option. One advantage is that the principle is fairly well established internationally, \neven if there is no clear and authoritative statement regarding its status as customary law. The \nGerman government could develop and support an expanded legal interpretation of the polluter pays \nprinciple by which inefficient resource use would qualify as \u201cpolluting\u201d. In other words, actors using \nresources inefficiently should be regarded as \u201cpolluters\u201d and should bear the costs caused by the \ninefficiency. This interpretation could partly build on international practice with regard to waste. \nThere are few established or potential legal principles that have at least some plausible link to RE and \ncould be potentially built upon. Obviously, the principle of sustainable development could include \nnotions of RE, but apart from questions about its legal status, it has been used for so many claims and \nuploaded with so many notions that it does not appear to be useful for giving legal weight to RE. More \nlikely principles include the precautionary principle , the principle of intergenerational equity  and \nthe status principle of common concern . All of these options have drawbacks which would make it \nmore difficult for Germany to build on: Besides the open question of its legal status, the precautionary \nprinciple is aimed at dealing with and acting on the basis of scientific uncertainty. Its wordings give no \nindication that it is directed at using resources efficiently or saving them for future use. If Germany \nwanted to build on the precautionary principle, it would have to add a meaning to it that is quite far FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 224 \n from the current concept. We suggest that this would require much higher political effort than building \non the polluter pays principle. \nSimilar considerations apply to \u201cinter-generational equity\u201d and \u201ccommon concern\u201d. In terms of \nsubstance, the concept of inter-generational equity is close to RE and could plausibly incorporate the \nnotion that it is fair to use resources efficiently in order to leave enough for future generations. On the \nother hand, its legal status is far weaker than the precautionary principle and the polluter pays \nprinciple. While it could be fairly easy for Germany to adopt a position that inter-generational equity \nalso includes RE, it would be more difficult to give legal weight to this view at the international level. \nThe concept could also be used for interpreting other norms or principles that are focused on \nallocation of resources in a way that also includes conservation over time .  \nWith regard to common concern, there is no single concept to build on. One option is to work towards \nestablishing resource efficiency as a \u201ccommon concern\u201d at the international level. This is not \nimplausible, since there is no internationally agreed or common understanding of what being a \n\u201ccommon concern\u201d entails. But we suggest that even if successful, establishing RE as a \u201ccommon \nconcern\u201d would have less impact compared to an interpretation of the polluter pays principle. The few \nexisting examples of \u201ccommon concern\u201d are less widely accepted and less clear in terms of content \nthan the polluter pays principle, and draw potential specific meaning mainly from treaty provisions. \nAnother option is to interpret existing common heritage or common concern in light of RE, for instance \nbased on the concept of intergenerational equity (see above). However, this option would have to \nspecifically address the few items that have the status of \u201ccommon concern\u201d or \u201ccommon heritage\u201d, \nand impact would be limited to them.  \nOf course, Germany could pursue more than one option, although it is likely to require a high internal \ncoordination and positioning effort.  \nLevers for resource efficiency : Cross-cutting general obligation on states.  \n \n3.2.1.3 Paris Agreement: Address resource efficiency  \nMid-term/long-term: Germany could address and promote RE as a topic through the Paris Agreement. \nThe on-going negotiations under the climate offer a range of options for doing so, e.g. from one-off \nevents to regular agenda items, and from a platform for exchanging information to anchoring normative \ntext in COP decisions. In terms of specific issues, options include, inter alia, including RE in NDCs or in \nreporting formats. \nDescription : Germany could promote and address RE in the Paris Agreement. As part of the climate \nregime, the Paris Agreement provides an existing and basically universal multilateral platform.880 It \nprovides a thematic hook for addressing RE, since the preamble expressly recognises the important \nrole of sustainable patterns of consumption and production in addressing climate change. Moreover, \nthe operative part lists sustainable management of natural resources as one possible content of \nadaptation action that parties have to engage in. There is also political recognition of the general \nrelevance of RE for climate goals among a number of governments, as e.g. in the G7\u2019s 2017 statement \nthat a \u201csubstantial increase in resource efficiency is essential to meet [...] climate goals.\u201d881  \nHowever, RE is currently not a topic that is explicitly or separately addressed in the climate regime in \nterms of process or content. This leaves open a whole range of objectives and options that Germany \ncould pursue, from e.g. a one-off space for discussing RE  to anchoring normative text in COP \ndecisions . The disadvantage of not having an already existing formal space for discussing RE is that \nmore political effort is required to establish such a space for a new issue. In addition, Germany does \nnot engage in the climate regime on its own and instead has to negotiate as part of the EU. Germany \n \n880 We note that the US administration notified the UN in August 2017 that it \u201cintends to\u201d withdraw from the Paris \nAgreement, but has not done so as of April 2018. \n881 G7 Bologna Environment Ministers\u2019 Meeting, 11-12 June 2017, Communique, para 34. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 225 \n would have to first embed its own objectives regarding RE in the EU position and negotiating lines and \nthen pursue them through the EU. \nGermany would therefore have to carefully define its objectives in order to focus its political effort. For \ninstance, it would have to decide whether it wants to address RE as part of an existing agenda item, \ne.g. regarding reporting rules, or whether to aim at a new and separate space . The latter would \nprobably require high and long-term political effort.  \nPolitical considerations would include which aspects of RE are relevant for climate change and more \nlikely to be acceptable. Germany could build on work by IRP, which has started paving the ground by \nhighlighting the link between resource use and climate change, and on a side event it co-hosted at \nCOP23 in 2017.882 Another aspect could be whether addressing more and more topics could at some \nstage overburden the UNFCCC process and have little impact. On the other hand, the climate regime \nhas been able to accommodate and address \u201cnew\u201d topics over time.883  \nGermany could start addressing RE through a purely procedural approach such as a workshop  or \nround table . New topics have sometimes started this way in the past.884 In order to get political \nsupport for a procedural approach that is formally part of the negotiations, Germany might be able to \nbuild on the side event on RE it hosted at COP23 in Bonn in 2017. While procedurally this may seem to \nrequire only little political effort, in practice this is not necessarily the case.  \nIt might be simpler to work towards addressing RE in a COP decision under a relevant agenda item , \nstarting with relatively simple and general content e.g. based on SDG language. The thematic basis \ncould be coherence and co-benefits between adaptation SDGs, together with the IRP reports relevant \nto climate change and emissions. It could build on the IRP study on the potential of RE for emission \nreductions as envisaged by the G7 in the Bologna Roadmap.  \nA more ambitious objective could be to include RE in the Nationally Determined Contributions \n(NDCs), i.e. the climate action plans each party has to periodically prepare and update. This does not \nnecessarily have to be prescriptive. RE could also be included  in the various reporting formats  such \nas the Biennial Reports and Biennial Update Reports.885 The reporting guidelines could be amended to \ninclude information on RE. However, we do not recommend pursuing these options at this stage. Since \nthe \u201crulebook\u201d with more detailed rules was adopted at COP 24 in 2018 and scheduled for review in \n2027,886 political opportunity very small until the review. For reporting, it is particularly difficult to \nintroduce new topics for reporting because the Paris Agreement explicitly requires that the new \ntransparency regime avoid placing undue burden on parties. On the other hand, the rules do not \nprevent parties from including RE as part of their NDCs, strategies and as other relevant information in \ntheir reporting about implementation. \nLevers for resource efficiency : Potentially all relating to climate change, depending on Germany\u2019s \npreferences and opportunities pursued in the climate regime.  \n \n \n \n882 For instance, UNEP/IRP, \u201c10 Key Messages on Climate Change\u201d, available at http://www.resourcepanel.org/reports/10-key-\nmessages-climate-change . \n883 For instance, agriculture is undoubtedly highly relevant for climate change and yet it took years of negotiations until the \nfirst substantive COP decision was adopted in 2017. \n884 E.g. the issue of \u201cReducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable \nmanagement of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries\u201d (REDD+), cf.

Since \nGermany successfully invested political capital into setting up this process during its presidency in \n2017, it makes sense to sustain this process and its political dynamic. However, it is not self-evident \nthat there will be a meaningful follow-up on its initiatives. \nHaving and keeping an issue on the G20 agenda is not necessarily a major step towards legal \nprovisions, but it is highly relevant step politically. In the short term, Germany should signal and offer \nits continued support of the RE Dialogue to the current G20 presidency. This should require only small \npolitical effort, in particular in view of the incoming presidency of Japan at the end of 2018. \nIn the medium term, Germany could move the RE Dialogue towards more concrete work and \noutcomes, e.g. goals, definitions, or actions. This would be the next step after the issue has been put on \nthe agenda and the RE Dialogue has established itself as a continuing process. In terms of content, \nGermany could explore to what extent the work under the G7 Alliance could be introduced into and \npicked up by the G20. Besides, the link between RE and climate change could provide a separate or \nadditional basis for obtaining political buy-in from other countries.  \nMoving the RE Dialogue from being an exchange of ideas to potentially developing recommendations \nfor action by G20 member states might require medium political effort. The shift could be sensitive for \nsome members. \nLevers for resource efficiency : Defining political targets, strengthening research and improving the \nknowledge base, promoting resource efficiency in production and consumption. \n \n3.2.2.2 Continue G7 Alliance for Resource Efficiency and coordinate with G20 dialogue  \nMid-term: Germany should review progress on the Bologna Roadmap through the G7 and direct it \ntowards more specific plans and actions regarding RE.  \nMid-term: Germany should pursue opportunities for co-ordinating the G20 dialogue with the G7 Alliance \nfor Resource Efficiency. \nDescription : Besides the G20, the G7 also address RE, inter alia with the Toyama Framework on \nMaterial Cycles and the 5-year Bologna Roadmap of 2017. Similar to the G20, the G7 is a political \nforum with no direct opportunity for strengthening RE in legal terms. But as a regular high-level forum \nit can strengthen and expand acceptance of RE as a shared objective, and its agreed goals and action \nplans can lay the groundwork for potentially embedding RE in international law in the future. \nThe G7 explicitly welcomed the G20 Resource Efficiency Dialogue. There is obvious potential for \nlinkages and co-ordination, even though the political parameters for the two fora remain separate. One \noption could be to maintain a division of labour between the G7 and G20. For instance, the G7 Bologna \nRoadmap could set out concrete actions for G7 members while the G20 provides a platform for \nexchange. Alternatively, the G7 could take the lead while the G20 follows suit later.

But we do not recommend changing the IRP\u2019s institutional setup or mandate.  \nDescription : Although the IRP is not the only or biggest scientific institution working on RE, it has \ngained standing in providing scientific advice for the policy level. Since its establishment in 2007, the \nIRP has gained credibility and political relevance as an expert body, as demonstrated by the G7 \nBologna Roadmap. Germany should continue to support that role at the international level. This \nincludes support for the reforms suggested by the 2016 evaluation of the IRP, which pointed to a more \ngeneral re-thinking of the Panel\u2019s approach to achieve policy impact. The evaluators recommend, \namong others, inclusion of \u201cpolicy and use-seeking sciences\u201d in the Panel and strengthening the role of \nstakeholders. Beyond \u201cpotential user interests\u201d from industry, this should clearly include representa-\ntives from civil society.  \nWe do not recommend changing the IRP\u2019s institutional setup or mandate without a clear strategic \nvision, in particular in in relation to the proposals for an International Resource Agency (see Section \n3.2.2.11 below). In our view, the IRP\u2019s institutional setup or mandate should be maintained in \nprinciple, besides incremental improvements such as financial support. Changing them would risk \njeopardising its impact rather than being an opportunity for increasing it. There is no necessity in \nmoulding the IRP into e.g. an IPCC equivalent, as the scientific and political issues relating to RE are \ndifferent from climate change. The physical science and impacts are not a similar challenge or \npolitically controversial. In addition, the IPPC has an explicit role for providing scientific input into a \nspecific treaty regime - the climate regime with UNFCCC, KP and the Paris Agreement. As yet there is \nno similar demand or role that the IRP could fulfil in respect of RE. Similar considerations would in \nrelation to a potential International Resource Agency. Such an international organisation would be \nquite different in all aspects from the current IRP and it would require careful assessment whether it \ncould make sense to try to shape the IRP in that direction. \nLevers for resource efficiency : Depending on the specific mandate: Strengthening research and improve \nthe knowledge base, promoting resource efficiency in production and consumption; promoting advice \non resource efficiency for companies, the use of environmental management schemes, the integration \nof resource efficiency in standardization. \n3.2.2.4 IRP to explore potential of international-level policies for resource efficiency, including a global taxation \nof resources \nThe IRP should be commissioned (e.g., by the G20 or the OECD) with a study on potential future \ninternational-level policies for resource efficiency, including the potential design and impacts of a global \nsystem to tax resources. This could be a first step towards future economic instruments that provide \nincentives for more RE. \nDescription : To date, the International Resource Panel has provided policy advice focusing on national-\nlevel resource policies. An important new field of advice would be potential international-level \nresource policies, beyond the existing set of policies (objectives, binding and non-binding provisions \netc.). The report at hand already provides a stocktake and a number of suggestions for strengthening \nresource efficiency through international policies. However, the IRP due to its mandate and \ncomposition has greater international legitimacy as well as more communicative capacities than the \nproject team authoring this report. An assessment of options on how to further develop international \nresource efficiency governance from the IRP could hence provide an important impetus to the \ninternational debate. Such an assessment would benefit from involving \u201cpolicy and use-seeking FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 228 \n sciences\u201d, including the legal sciences, as generally recommended by the 2016 evaluation of the IRP for \nits future work.887 \nOne field to explore in such an assessment could be the global taxation of resources. It would provide \nan economic incentive for all actors (companies, the state, consumers) to use resources more \nefficiently.888 If it was introduced as part of ecological tax reforms it could also help shift the tax base \naway from labour towards ecological impacts.889 Currently such taxes exist in some countries for \nspecific resources like building materials or energy.890  \nHowever, several questions remain to be answered before such a scheme should be proposed \ninternationally and for all resources. First, further research is necessary regarding appropriate \ntaxation rates and bases of taxation in order to avoid e.g. environmentally undesirable substitution \neffects. Secondly, legal issues have to be solved like the implementation of border adjustments.  \nGlobally implemented resource taxes could have a significant impact on all aspects of production and \nconsumption. However, before the idea can be brought forward on the international level some basic \nquestions have to be answered, making it a medium- to long-term proposition.  \nAn IRP study on the global taxation of resources could solve knowledge gaps and place a respective tax \non the international agenda. \nLevers for resource efficiency : Improving knowledge base; economic instruments/incentives. \n \n3.2.2.5 Reporting requirements for companies regarding resource efficiency \nThere are opportunities to promote RE reporting requirements for companies at the national level e. g. \nregarding the implementation of the EU directive on non-financial reporting which could be done by \nintroducing resource efficiency into the German \u201cSustainability Code\u201d. Also research on appropriate \n(sector specific) indicators could be commissioned.  \nDescription : Reporting publicly on resource consumption at company level is not in itself an \ninstrument to improve resource efficiency. Nevertheless, transparency can be the basis for further \ndevelopments, because it requires companies to gather respective data which are necessary if \nresource efficiency measures are to be adopted. Additionally, publication of such data can be an \nincentive for companies to increase resource efficiency when performance is benchmarked with other \ncompanies of the same sector and if it influences access to funding. Furthermore, such data could also \nimprove governmental statistics on national resource consumption as a whole and regarding specific \nsectors. \nWhile anchoring reporting requirements for companies regarding resource efficiency in an \ninternational treaty is not very realistic it could be integrated into the national implementation of the \nEU-directive on non-financial reporting891. If a change of the law itself is not currently possible, RE \ncould be integrated into the German \u201cSustainability Code\u201d because the fulfillment of the codes \nrequirements is equivalent to meeting the CSR RUGs specifications.892 International standards like GRI \nor KPIs for ESG (see Section 2.3.1) could be taken as reference points for specific reporting \nrequirements regarding RE.

Alternative opportunities include strengthening the \ndiffusion and implementation of EMAS (the European environmental management system which is \nmore demanding than the ISO Standards) within the EU. Another option would be to make \nenvironmental management systems a requirement for public tenders (see also Section 2.2.7). Taking \nthe national level into focus the implementation of an environmental management system could be \nmade mandatory for public institutions, at least at the federal level. \nIf environmental management systems were mandatory the impact on resource efficiency in \nproduction could be significant. \nLevers for resource efficiency : promoting resource efficiency in production (promoting the use of \nenvironmental management schemes) \n3.2.2.7 UNEP: Strenghtening National Cleaner Production Centres and the global network for Resource Efficient \nand Cleaner Production (RECPnet) \nThe German government could, firstly, provide support for the UNIDO and UNEP programmes on \nNational Cleaner Production Centres and Resource Efficient and Cleaner Production (RECP). Secondly, it \ncould promote expanding the financial basis of the programmes (including the number of donors, e.g. at \nleast all G7 countries). Among others, Germany could provide an own financial contribution. The overall \nobjective of the initiative is that NCPCs can be established in further countries and that existing NCPCs \ncan branch out to the regional levels.  \nDescription : National Cleaner Production Centres (NCPCs) and National Cleaner Production \nProgrammes (NCPPs) have been assessed to have \u201cresulted in substantial benefits at country and \nglobal levels\u201d893.

The initiative would address cities as the locus where most goods and services are \nproduced, consumed and the respective waste is created. The initiative\u2019s core mechanism would be the \ncreation of an annual award with significant price money for cities with a \u201czero waste policy\u201d. The \nprice money could be provided by (members of) the G7 Alliance on Resource Efficiency, including by \nGermany.\nThe initiative could either award cities for having implemented outstanding zero waste policies (ex \npost), or it could co-fund the implementation of ambitious action plans to create zero waste cities (ex \nante). Activities would need to be defined as eligible for funding through the award.898  \nThe award could be anchored within UNEP\u2019s \u201cResource Efficient Cities Programme\u201d or within the \n\u201cGreener Cities Partnership\u201d of UNEP and UN Habitat (which covers, among others, resource flows, \nefficiency and waste management)899. \nInstead of an award, a (sub-)programme or fund could be launched as well. \nThe award would help internationally diffusing the idea of waste reduction at a municipal level, \nprovide best practice examples and thus enable learning.

This includes promoting (in the \nmedium-term) a systematic review of the implementation and effectiveness of the World Bank\u2019s \nsafeguard policies and the IFC\u2019s performance standards with regard to resource efficiency, a broadening \nof the scope of application of the Safeguards from project financing to programmatic loans and increased \nfunding for circular economy business models under the IFC. \nDescription : The initiative could comprise a) a systematic review of the implementation and \neffectiveness of the World Bank\u2019s safeguard policies and the IFC\u2019s performance standards with regard \nto resource efficiency, b) a broadening of the scope of application of the Safeguards from project \nfinancing to programmatic loans and c) increased funding for circular economy business models under \nthe IFC. \na) The World Bank\u2019s900 \u201cEnvironmental and Social Framework\u201d (ESF, also called \u201cSafeguard Policies\u201d; \nadopted in revised form in 2016) as well as the Performance Standards of the World Bank Group\u2019s \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) (since 2012) have a potential to strengthen resource \nefficiency in the projects funded by the Bank, in particular through ESS-3 and PS-3. However, it is \nunclear how effective these standards currently are with regard to resource efficiency \u2013 an issue \nthat is much less \u2018visible\u2019 and less under civil society or public scrutiny than, for instance, pollution, \ndegradation of nature or social impacts.  \nIt would hence be recommendable to conduct an evaluation on how effective these standards are \nwith regard to actually increasing resource efficiency.  \nb) The initiative could also include the suggestion that the standard\u2019s scope of application is extended \nfrom project financing to more programmatic loans (DPL, P4R). These make up a significant share \nof total Bank funding and can have substantial and long-term sustainability impacts. \nc) Finally, the initiative would also aim at the IFC\u2019s private sector investments. In developing \ncountries, investments in a circular economy are hampered by specific challenges. The IFC as the \nprivate sector branch of World Bank could increase its financial support (through loans, equity, \nventure capital etc.) to companies in developing countries that invest in new Circular Economy \nBusiness Models. This would fit with the \u201cSustainability\u201d priority in the IFC\u2019s investments in the \nmanufacturing sector and the \u201cCities\u201d priority related to the infrastructure sector. Along with \nfinance, the IFC\u2019s advisory services901 on such business models would be strengthened. Increased \nemphasis on resource efficiency and circular economy business models within the IFC would also \nneed to be \u2018passed on\u2019 to the financial intermediaries with which the IFC works and which on-lend \nmoney to SMEs.  \nThe initiative would probably require significant political efforts. Forging a coalition with the G7 or \nG20 would therefore be an important precondition for success. Considering that the revised ESF have \nonly been in force since 2016, they will likely be reviewed only in a few years\u2019 time (e.g., 2021). Efforts \nin this respect should therefore focus on putting resource efficiency on the World Bank\u2019s agenda so as \nto increase the likelihood of focusing on the issue in the future review.  \n \n900 i.e., the IBRD and IDA. \n901 http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/CORP_EXT_Content/IFC_External_Corporate_Site/Solutions/ \nProducts+and+Services/Advisory.

It \nwould also improve access to capital for companies investing in the circular economy in developing \ncountries. \nLevers for resource efficiency : The initiative addresses the development and diffusion of resource- and \nenergy-efficient production and treatment processes; promotion of the use of environmental \nmanagement schemes; and innovation though mainstreaming resource efficiency in product design. \n \n3.2.2.10 OECD: Implementation review of OECD Recommendation of the Council on Resource Productivity (2008) \n\u2013 Ten years later \nThe German government could request the pending evaluation of progress with work related to the \nOECD\u2018s Council Recommendation on Resource Productivity.  \nDescription : In 2008, the OECD Council adopted a recommendation on resource productivity.902 It \nencourages the OECD members to improve resource productivity by promoting environmentally \neffective and economically efficient uses of natural resources and materials at the macro, sectoral and \nmicro levels as well as to strengthen capacity for analysing material flows and the associated \nenvironmental impacts. The OECD\u2019s Environment Policy Committee was required to report back to the \nCouncil within five years (i.e., till 2013). However, there are no current documents available indicating \nthat the Environment Policy Committee has indeed assessed member countries\u2019 respective activities.  \nTen years after the Council Recommendation was adopted, a new effort should be made to review its \nimplementation and, based on the evaluation, to develop further avenues for action.  \nThe request for the progress report could be voiced jointly with the other G7 countries. (In 2008, it \nhad been the G8 that had called for an interim report on \u201cResource Productivity in the G8 and the \nOECD\u201d) \nThe request would improve the state of knowledge with regard to policy implementation and could \nstimulate further action within the OECD. \nLevers for resource efficiency : The recommendation addresses the lever \u201cimproving the knowledge \nbase\u201d. \n3.2.2.11 Creation of an International Resource Agency \nGermany could support the creation of an International Resource Agency. \nDescription : An international Resource Agency, as called for by several actors903, could be established \neither under auspices of UNEP, UNEP & UNIDO, or as an independent institution. It could be modeled \non the example of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)904 or the International Energy \n \n902 OECD (2008). \n903 The most elaborate proposal is by Bleischwitz et al. (2012); see also Deutscher Bundestag (2013) and SRU (2012). \n904 IRENA is an intergovernmental organisation that supports countries in their transition to a sustainable energy future, and \nserves as the principal platform for international cooperation, a centre of excellence, and a repository of policy, technology, \nresource and financial knowledge on renewable energy (http://www.irena.org/aboutirena). IRENA\u2019s ultimate decision-\nmaking authority is the Assembly, made up of one representative from each Member. IRENA\u2019s Council is composed of 21 \nMember States which are elected for a two-year term on a rotating basis, representing both developing and developed \ncountries and a fair and equitable geographical distribution. The Council is accountable to the Assembly and responsible for \nfacilitating consultation and cooperation among IRENA members, reviewing the draft work programme, draft budget and \nannual report. The Secretariat (i.e., the Director-General and his staff), provides administrative and technical support to the \nAssembly, the Council and their subsidiary bodies (http://www.irena.org/institutionalstructure). IRENA is funded both by \nvoluntary and mandatory contributions made by members (the latter on the basis of the IRENA scale of contributions which \nin turn are base d on based on the scale of assessments of the United Nations (cf. Article XII, paragraph A (1) of the IRENA \nStatute). IRENA\u2019s products and services include annual reviews of renewable energy employment; renewable energy \ncapacity statistics; renewable energy cost studies; Renewables Readiness Assessments; a \u2018Global Atlas\u2019 which maps resource \npotential by source and by location; renewable energy benefits studies; a roadmap to double renewable energy use \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 233 \n Agency (IEA).905 It could either focus on \u201cresource efficiency\u201d (\u201cInternational Resource Efficiency \nAgency\u201d) or it could be mandated to deal with sustainable resource management in a broader sense \n(\u201cInternational Resource Management Agency\u201d). \nDepending on the concrete scope of its mandate, it could provide services concerning observation, \ndata and sustainability scenarios, information dissemination and learning through awareness-raising \nprogrammes and training courses. The Agency could also serve as the secretariat of an international \nmultistakeholder forum (see below).906  \nLaunching a new agency would require significant political efforts. Its establishment would require an \ninterested circle of founding governments; further states could become members later on. The \nvisibility and clout of the agency might be increased if it was linked to a specific policy process, such as \nan international treaty or a \u201c2% Initiative for Resource Efficiency\u201d (see below). With regard to the \norganizational setup, the model could be IRENA with its global membership and equitable \nrepresentation of developing and developed countries in the Council as the operational decision-\nmaking body, and with contributions being based on the UN scale of assessments.  \nCreating a new institutional actor (agency) with a mandate for resource efficiency can shift the balance \nin the international discourse. This holds particularly when the agency can offer an \u2018exclusive\u2019 service, \nsuch as high quality data. \nLevers for resource efficiency : Depending on its mandate, establishing an International Resource \nAgency could address the lever of \u201cstrengthening research and improving the science basis; transfer of \nknowledge\u201d. \n \n3.2.2.12 Define mid-level goals on resource efficiency (e.g., in OECD, G20 and potential Framework Convention on \nResource Efficiency) \nThe German government could stimulate an international debate (in various fora) on the definition of \nmid-level goals and indicators on resource efficiency. These goals and indicators would be sector and raw \nmaterial specific and could build a bridge to economy-wide goals and indicators on general resource \nefficiency. \nDescription : The debate on resource efficiency is characterized by two main levels. A meta-level aiming \nat increasing resource efficiency on the level of economies, and a level where resource efficiency is \nimplemented in very concrete cases such as the optimization of individual industrial processes. \nAlthough both levels are necessary for increasing resource efficiency, they often appear to exist in \nparallel and with few interlinkages. A major reason for this situation is the fact that many meta-level \ngoals have not been broken down to individual resources and sectors. Vice-versa, sector specific gains \nare difficult to be accounted for on meta-level indicators.  \n \nworldwide by 2030 (\u2018REmap\u2019); renewable energy technology briefs; facilitation of regional renewable energy planning; \nrenewable energy project development tools (cf. http://www.irena.org/aboutirena). IRENA\u2019s statute entered into force in \n2010 and it has 156 members, with 25 countries being in the process of becoming members. The process of launching \nIRENA was strongly supported by the German government. \n905 The IEA is an autonomous body within the OECD framework working on providing clean, reliable and affordable energy \nfor its 30 member countries, focusing on four main areas, namely energy security, economic development, environmental \nawareness and engagement worldwide ( https://www.iea.org/about/ ). The IEA has attracted 30 members since 1974. The \nIEA\u2019s main decision-making body is the Governing Board, composed of energy ministers or their senior representatives \nfrom each member country. Through the IEA Ministerial meeting that takes place every two years, the IEA Secretariat \ndevelops ideas for existing or new work programmes, which are then discussed with member countries in various IEA \ncommittees and ultimately presented to the Governing Board for approval. The IEA also has several Standing Groups, \nCommittees and Working Parties made up of member country government officials, meeting several times a year. The size \nof the IEA budget and the scope of its work are determined biannually by member countries, with assessed contributions \nfor member countries being based on a formula that takes account of the size of each member's economy \n(http://www.iea.org/about/structure/ ).  \n906 Bleischwitz et al. (2012) at 59.  FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 234 \n To overcome this problem, it is recommended to fill this mid-level gap with sector and raw material \nspecific analysis, goals and indicators. An approach on how this could be achieved was developed \nwithin the research project \u201cGermany 2049\u201d by the \u00d6ko-Institut (2017).  \nGenerally, one first step could be to define resources and sectors that should be addressed by specific \nanalysis, sector consultations and subsequently efficiency targets and measures. This could encompass \nconstruction materials, steel, aluminum, non-ferrous metals, industrial minerals, biotic raw materials \nfor manufacturing, as well as oil based raw materials for manufacturing (e.g. polymers, lubricants).A \nconvention would be the most appropriate locus for said goals, and their anchoring in a treaty would \nsupplement analogous goals at the level of the OECD and G20. In the latter case, the goals would be \nbinding. In the former cases, they would be non-binding but still carry political weight, in particular if \nlinked to a monitoring and review mechanism. \nThe definition of mid-level (raw material and sector specific) goals allows taking into account the \nmaterial/ sector specific problem characteristics as well as differing economic, ecologic and social \nimpacts and improvement potentials of resource consumption. Breaking down general resource \nefficiency goals to mid-level goals also allows a targeted involvement of relevant industries. \nLevers for resource efficiency : The proposal provides a \u2018meta\u2019 lever for RE. The goals can stimulate \naction promoting resource efficiency in production and consumption as well as fostering a circular \neconomy. Defining goals can also raise public awareness. \n \n3.2.2.13 Voluntary Country and Company Guiding Principles on Strengthening Resource Efficiency \nVoluntary guidelines could be an alternative to a binding treaty on RE. Such guidelines could address \nboth states and the private sector and be the basis for further legal developments. \nDescription : If resource efficiency cannot be anchored in an international treaty, another option would \nbe the development of voluntary guidelines or guiding principles on resource efficiency for states as \nwell as business.  \nGuiding principles for states and businesses already exist for other issues, for instance in the form of \nthe UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights or the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for \nResponsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. \nThe interesting aspect here is that especially the UN Guiding Principles define state responsibilities as \nwell as the responsibility of companies \u2013 which, at least partially, ended the shifting of responsibilities \nregarding the protection and respect of human rights and spurred legislative action, e.g. the French \nDuty of Vigilance Law, on the national level. The definition of responsibilities would set such Guiding \nPrinciples apart from mere handbooks or \u201chow to\u201d- manuals. \nGuiding Principles on RE could define content, processes and indicators regarding resource efficiency \nfor governments907 as well as economic sectors and individual businesses.908 \nThe political effort and the potential impact would largely depend on the institution or forum the \nguidelines would be linked to. Interesting options could be either the UN (UNEP/UNEA) or the OECD.  \nA more limited alternative to such guiding principles would be resource efficiency guidelines that only \naddress companies and could be initiated by a global industry association like the WBCSD. \nPotential impact : Taking the impact of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as a \nreference point, such voluntary guidelines could stimulate on the ground learning by businesses and \n \n907 First ideas for potential content could be taken from ProgRess and would include the promotion of resource efficiency in \nproduction and consumption, promoting the circular economy and closing material flows. \n908 Relevant aspects might include the elimination of waste throughout the entire lifecycle, optimizing efficiency or moving \nproducts, services and the process that develop or deliver them out of the physical world and into the virtual realm (Heck \nand Rogers (2014)). FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 235 \n governmental institutions as well as constitute the groundwork for further legally binding \ninstruments. Which means the potential impact can be rated as high.  \nLevers for resource efficiency : potentially all levers addressed in ProgRess. \n \n3.2.2.14  \u201c2% Initiative for Resource Efficiency\u201d (e.g., UNEA, incl. GEF funding)  \nThe German government could promote an international initiative where countries would commit \nthemselves voluntarily to increasing economy-wide resource efficiency by a certain percentage. \nDescription : The initiative would be non-legally binding. UN member states would commit to \nincreasing their resource efficiency by a certain share per annum (e.g., 2 %, in analogy to \u201c2 Degree\u201d \nclimate goal). It would need to be made certain that the share is both realistic and ambitious, and \nsurpasses the (medium-term) increases in productivity. If no single figure can be internationally \ndetermined, countries could \u2018pledge\u2019 their own targets, maybe in a predefined range.  \nIt would be necessary to agree on an adequate RE definition909, on indicator(s) for measuring progress \nand a simple review mechanism/ monitoring system. \nThe initiative could be adopted by the UN Environmental Assembly (UNEA). It might be framed as an \ninternational effort to implement SDG 8.4. \nTo provide means of implementation for developing countries, a funding sub-priority could be \nestablished under the Global Environmental Facility (e.g., under the \u2018Chemicals and Waste\u2019 focal area \nor a suitable focal area/ integrated approach under GEF-7).  \nThe initiative would create pressure on national governments to continually work on RE. Regular \nreviews would keep up the pressure. \nLevers for resource efficiency : The (cross-cutting) lever addressed is \u201cgoal / target setting\u201d, which can \nstimulate different types of concrete RE-promoting action. \n \n3.2.2.15 Resolution on Extended Producer Responsibility and Eco-design (e.g., as UNEA Resolution)  \nThe German government could organise an international coalition (e.g., in the context of the G20) to \ninitiate the process for an international (e.g., UNEA) resolution on Extended Producer Responsibility and \nEco-design. Such a resolution should motivate industrialised countries to update and make more \nambitious their EPR schemes and support South-South learning in order to expand (and in some cases \nestablish) EPR schemes in the Global South. \nDescription : The OECD defines Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) as an environmental policy \napproach in which a producer\u2019s responsibility for a product is extended to the post-consumer stage of \na product\u2019s life cycle.910 While in recent years, EPRs systems have been expanded, most of them have \nbeen implemented in the EU and North America, mostly covering electronics, packaging, tires and \nvehicles/auto batteries. Frequently, EPR schemes have focused on recovering material from waste \nproducts while neglecting the re-use and reduction of waste (which have higher priority in the waste \nhierarchy).911 The OECD assesses that existing ERP schemes can be made more effective by, inter alia, \nincreasing their level of ambition; broadening the scope of products covered; better internalising \nenvironmental costs; and strengthening enforcement, particularly to reduce free-riding and leakage. \n \n909 To date, according to UNEP, there is little consensus on a framework definition of resource efficiency. \n910 An EPR policy is characterised by the shifting of responsibility (physically and/or economically; fully or partially) \nupstream toward the producer and away from municipalities; and by the provision of incentives to producers to take into \naccount environmental considerations when designing their products. EPR seeks to integrate signals related to the \nenvironmental characteristics of products and production processes throughout the whole product chain. See \nhttp://www.oecd.org/environment/extended-producer-responsibility.htm.  \n911 OECD (2016a). \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 236 \n EPR schemes also suffer from the conceptual drawback that obligations to take back a product do not \ndetermine the recycling of the materials contained and that even mandatory recycling rates \u2013 which \nusually refer to the total weight of a product \u2013 do not provide incentives for the recovery of specific \nmaterials, such as precious metals.912 Finally, EPR schemes have not succeeded to the expected extent \nto encourage producers in designing their products more environmentally-friendly.913 Hence, ERP \nschemes need to be developed further, adjusted to the specific challenges of emerging economies and \ndeveloping countries914, and should be complemented by efforts to strengthen the incentives for the \neco-design of products. Generally, EPR models should follow clearly defined targets related to \ncollection, recycling and refurbishing volumes. \nAn international resolution on Extended Producer Responsibility and Eco-design should motivate \nindustrialised countries to update and make more ambitious their EPR schemes. It would need to be \nlinked to support for sharing experiences and in particular South-South learning on EPR and eco-\ndesign. The resolution should call for EPR approaches that translate the polluter pays principle in a \nway that companies placing related products onto the market are charged with the tasks and all \nrelated costs to organize environmentally sound collection and recycling. \nThe initiative would help to internationally raise the profile of the concepts of EPR and eco-design and \npromote an update of EPR activities in countries that already implement the concept. \nLevers for resource efficiency : The Resolution would address the lever \u201cstrengthening producer \nresponsibility\u201d in order to promote a circular economy. \n \n3.2.2.16 Creation of an international (public-private) recycling fund \nThe German government could promote the creation of an international recycling fund. It would provide \neconomic incentives (e.g. pre-defined premium payments on pre-defined volumes of soundly recycled \nwaste) in order to stimulate environmentally sound recycling in developing countries. \nDescription : The background of this idea is the fact that recycling is commonly only applied when \neconomically feasible or where a stringent regulatory framework encourages related activities. From a \nglobal perspective, these preconditions are only given for certain waste types (valuable waste types \nsuch as metal scrap) and for countries with mature governance. Thus, in vast parts of the world, low \nand mid value waste is disposed or burned and not fed back into the industrial cycle. At the same time, \nrelated disposal or burning practices often have severe adverse impacts on human health and the \nenvironment. \nThere are various pilot projects where donors (public or private industry donors, mostly from \nindustrialized countries) incentivize the environmentally sound collection and recycling of waste in \ndeveloping countries and emerging economies. The goal is to avoid unsound treatment of waste and to \nincrease recycling rates. In this context, economic incentives (e.g. pre-defined premium payments on \ndefined volumes of soundly recycled waste) can provide a means to stimulate environmentally sound \nrecycling in environments where such recycling could not exist under free market conditions. \nAs many such pilot projects with limited local or bilateral scope are ongoing, experiences from related \ninitiatives could be collected to determine whether a larger initiative such as a global recycling fund \nunder a public-private partnership would be meaningful and feasible.  \nFrom the current perspective, private financing could come from internationally operating producers \nof equipment such as cars, batteries and electronics, starting with a voluntary initiative. Public donors \ncould facilitate the set-up of a related system, including structure, conditions, mechanism and \nmonitoring. The motivation of producers to contribute to such a scheme could be to show compliance \nwith the concept of Extended Producer Responsibility that has a global acceptance, but that can often \n \n912 Wilts et al.

Producers could also \nbe interested in the initiatives in order to avoid that numerous states come up with differing \n(regulatory) solutions. \nA potential mechanism for disbursing the fund\u2019s means would be to require evidence (e.g., a \ncertificate) on the appropriate recycling of a defined amount of waste.  \nThe fund would contribute to creating a business case for recycling, even in (developing) countries \nwith weak governance structures.  \nLevers for resource efficiency : The levers addressed are \u201cstrengthening recycling\u201d as well as \n\u201cOptimising the collection and recycling of bulk wastes\u201d, with a focus on developing countries. \n \n3.2.2.17 Country-driven resource-efficient procurement initiative (e.g., OECD initiative)  \nThe German government could initiate a country-driven sustainable procurement initiative in which \ngovernments commit themselves to increasing the share of publicly sourced products and services \nsourced that are resource efficient. \nDescription : The initiative would be a self-commitment of countries to set national targets for the share \nof sustainable products sourced by governments and public agencies. For instance, this could be an \nescalating target of 30% to 50% of products complying with resource-efficiency standards, drawing on \ncriteria of existing ecolabels. \nThe initiative could be started within the G7 Alliance for Resource Efficiency and / or then be spread to \nthe OECD member states. It could be designed as a \u201cchallenge\u201d, comparable to the \u201cBonn Challenge\u201d on \nrestoring tropical forests, where governments make \u2018pledges\u2019 as to the hectares of forests that they \nwill restore.915 The \u201cBonn Challenge\u201d also provides a forum for regularly discussing progress. \nPublic procurement constitutes some 15% of GDP within OECD countries, so that a greater integration \nof RE in public procurement could significantly strengthen market signals in favour of RE. \nLevers for resource efficiency : The initiative addresses the lever \u201cintegrating resource efficiency in \npublic procurement\u201d. \n \n3.2.2.18 G7 \u201cGolden carrot\u201d initiative to internationally promote ecological product design  \nThe German government could promote the creation of a \u2018Golden Carrot\u2019 initiative to internationally \nstimulate ecological product design in selected product groups.  \nDescription : Golden Carrot programmes are financial rewards (\u2018golden carrots\u2019) offered by the public \nsectors to producers in order to simulate innovation with regard to ecological product design, thus \naccelerating the development and commercialization of super-efficient end-uses. First introduced in \nthe 1990s in the US, golden carrot programmes have focused on energy efficiency and have been \noperated at national levels. 916 \nGermany could suggest that the G7 creates an international fund which finances a Golden Carrot \nProgramme. Under the programme, regular international producer competitions would be organized \nfor designing products in more resource efficient ways. The steering committee of the fund would \nconsider which (internationally traded) products are of specific interest with regard to increasing \nresource efficiency and would develop criteria for the award procedure. Potentially interesting \nproducts are batteries or standardised recycable thermal insulation modules. \n \n915 www.bonnchallenge.org/content/challenge.  \n916 On the history of the idea, cf. https://www.cee1.org/content/golden-carrots-beginning.

In the Forum, different industries and stakeholders would collaborate (in material-specific \nsub-forums) to develop environmentally and socially sustainable processes to close material flows \n(secondary material supply chains). The Forum could be linked to industry and civil society actors \ninvolved in the G20 process and its Resource Efficiency Dialogue.  \nDescription : As material flows in today\u2019s economy can span the globe,918 circular economy solutions \nand other options to increase resource efficiency in production and consumption also have to cross \nborders. \nTherefore, a global multistakeholder forum with several sector/resource specific sub-forums should \nbe initiated. Here, technical solutions as well as agreements between companies etc. can be developed \nand implemented. To improve legitimacy and include further sources of knowledge, the involvement \nof civil society organisations is necessary and should be financially supported. It should help \npreventing circular economy solutions at the cost of environmental standards and decent work \nconditions in recycling countries. \nFirst steps include the identification of critical resources (either regarding environmental and human \nrights impacts or regarding the volume) and the initiation of respective (industry / stakeholder) \u201cpilot \nforums\u201d. \nGetting industry interested in such a forum might require some political effort. Promising avenues \ninclude starting with forerunners and emphasising the industry benefits of closing resource flows in a \nglobal environment of increasing scarcity for a number of raw materials. The Forum could be linked to \nindustry and civil society actors involved in the G20 process and its Resource Efficiency Dialogue. The \nForum would be more targeted in its composition than the existing \u201cBusiness 20\u201d (B20) group (i.e. the \nofficial business dialogue of the G20) and more focussed in terms of its mandate. However, interested \nmembers of the B20 could form the initial core of the Forum, in collaboration with interested members \nof the \u201cCivil 20\u201d (C20) civil society organisations involved in the G20 process. \nIdeally, the Forum would develop environmentally and socially sustainable processes to close material \nflows. If the Forum would be somehow linked to, for instance, a strengthening of producer \nresponsibilities, its impact would likely be higher.  \nLevers for resource efficiency : provision of sustainable raw materials, resource efficiency in production, \nresource efficiency in consumption, circular economy \n \n \n917 Grie\u00dfhammer et al.

The approach and overarching principles would be the same \nfor all resources. The framework treaty structure we propose could lay down these general principles \nand set, or allow for, specific obligations and provisions, such as reporting obligations, in separate \nparts, for instance in annexes. In contrast to e.g. the UNCCD, the annexes should be for specific sectors, \nproducts, materials etc., instead of regional. This treaty would be flexible and could be successively \nexpanded over time.  \nAbiotic resources would be specifically addressed in one annex. Goals and indicators are currently \nplaced in that annex - but it is up for discussion whether they could be placed in the treaty's main part. \nNot all provisions are drafted in legal treaty language. The articles' headings are mainly to assist the \ndrafting and could be deleted in the final treaty text. The following draft includes comments in italics \nand footnotes:  \n \nPreamble \nThe Parties to this Agreement, \nIn pursuit of the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals, \nMindful of the Earth\u2019s long-term boundaries, \nAcknowledging that resource efficiency yields numerous benefits for the environment, climate, health, \njobs and sustainable economic growth, \nRecalling the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns, \nRecalling  the Paris Agreement, which recognises that sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of \nconsumption and production, with developed country Parties taking the lead, play an important role in \naddressing climate change, \nRecognizing  the specific needs and special circumstances of developing country Parties, in particular \nthe special situations of the least developed countries with regard to funding and transfer of \ntechnology, \nAffirming  the importance of education, training, public awareness, public participation, public access \nto information and cooperation at all levels on the matters addressed in this Agreement, \nRecognizing  the importance of the engagements of all levels of government and various actors, in \naccordance with respective national legislations of Parties, in addressing sustainable development, \nHave agreed as follows: \nComment: The preamble could also restate the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources \nand the duty to prevent transboundary environmental harm: \u201cRe-affirming that States have, in \naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, a sovereign \nright to exploit their own resources pursuant to their environmental and developmental policies, and the \nresponsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the \nenvironment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\u201d This might be \nsupplemented by a statement that excessive use of a resource could result in significant harm to another \nstate, and that in this sense the obligation limits the sovereign right of states to exploit their resources. \n FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 242 \n  \nArticle 1 - Objective \nThe objective of this Agreement is to achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural \nresources along the entire life cycle of natural resources, products and infrastructure, and to \ncontribute to progressively improving global resource efficiency in consumption and production, in \nthe context of sustainable development, with a view to decoupling economic growth from \nenvironmental degradation. \nComment: Based on SDG 8.4 and 12.2 in order to stay close to previously agreed language and to avoid \nover-burdening the objective. Potential targets and indicators would be developed and agreed as part of \nthe specific annexes  \n \nArticle 2 - Definitions \nFor the purpose of this Agreement: \n\u201cParty\u201d means a Party to this Agreement, \n\u201dResources\u201d or \u201cnatural resources\u201d means [...], \n [...]  \nComment: Does it seem useful, necessary, and feasible to include an agreeable definition of natural \nresources, resource efficiency or other terms? Definitions may provide clarity on the scope of the \nagreement. On the other hand it could be better to leave it open for parties to either develop a definition \nover time, or to be pragmatic and leave it undefined, because the framework treaty envisages future \nguidance and annexes for specific materials, products or sectors. For instance, for the OECD the term \n\u201cresource\u201d includes natural resources but is limited to metallic and non-metallic industrial minerals, and \nbiomass, while excluding energy resources such as coal, oil and gas. The OECD notes that G7 countries \noperationalise the term differently and not always consistent with how such terms are used \ninternationally.919  \n \nArticle 3 - Guiding Provisions  \nIn taking action towards achieving the objectives of this Convention and implement its provisions, the \nParties shall be guided, inter alia, by the following: \n(a) Parties should utilise natural resources sparingly and economically with a view to conserving \nexisting natural resources for future generations and minimising negative environmental \nimpacts associated with resource extraction and use.  \n(b) Parties should include resource efficiency in promoting the internalisation of environmental \ncosts.  \n \n[Alternative wording: The internalisation of environmental costs should include resource \nefficiency.]  \n(c) Parties should avoid that risks and burdens are shifted between stages in the value chain, \nphases in the life-cycle, sectors, regions, resources and impacts.920  \n(d) [...] \n \n919 OECD (2016) p. 23-25. \n920 OECD (2016) p. 40; UNEP (2017) p. 8. FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 243 \n  \nComment: This article is intended to contain overarching principles and guidance as opposed to specific \nindividual obligations for parties. However, the distinction is not clear-cut and difficult to draw.  \nWith regard to (b), the polluter pay principle could promote resource efficiency basically by better \ninternalising external costs along the value chain and by treating inefficient resource use directly as \npollution. The latter would blur the conceptual distinction between paying for actual damage caused to \nthe environment and paying for using a good, service or resource (see the analysis of the polluter pays \nprinciple in the Research Report, section 2.1.1.10). The text suggested here chooses to avoid resolving \nthese difficult questions in the treaty text and instead to leave it to be addressed by parties through \nsubsequent treaty practice.  \n \nArticle 4 - General Obligations \n1.  Parties shall, in the light of different national circumstances and with developed country \nparties taking the lead,  \n(a) prepare, communicate and regularly update national strategies on resource efficiency,  \n(b) take steps to increase resource efficiency progressively over time with aim of achieving the \nobjective of the Agreement as set out in Article 1, for instance by,  \ni. addressing and improving policy integration and coherence; \nii. promoting resource-efficient production and consumption patterns, in accordance with \nnational policies and priorities, \niii. discouraging or preventing inefficient production and consumption patterns; \niv. promoting and implementing public procurement practices that are sustainable, in \naccordance with national policies and priorities;921 \nv. advancing technologies for obtaining materials from natural resources that eliminate \nwaste and toxics and support long-term ecosystem health; \nvi. promoting and requiring, where feasible and appropriate in accordance with national \npolicies and priorities, the application of environmental management systems; \nvii.  promoting sustainable materials management; \nviii. improving information about, and monitoring of, materials, their flows and \nenvironmental impacts; \nix. [...] \n2.  In addition to paragraph 1, each Party shall take measures with regard to each annex it is listed \nin. \nComment: Paragraph 2 is the legal link between this framework treaty text and specific commitments in \nannexes.  \nPotential targets and indicators would be developed and agreed as part of the specific annexes.  \n \n \nArticle 5 - Transparency on implementation \n \n921 SDG 12.7 FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 244 \n 1. Parties shall regularly provide information to the COP on how it implementsthis Convention \nand any Annexes applicable to it, for consideration by the COP. \n2. The information submitted under paragraph 1 shall contain at least the following information: \n(a) The national strategy referred to in Article 4(1)(a); \n(b) Information on action taken to implement this Agreement, including its annexes as applicable \nand the national strategy; \n(c) [...] \n3. COP to determine further content, modalities such as format and timetable. \n4. Reports to be made public. \n5. Follow-up to the reports, e.g. review, synthesis by Secretariat; discussion by COP.  \n \nArticle 6 - Cooperation and Support  \n1. Parties recognise the importance of international cooperation and support for the effective \nimplementation of this Agreement and the importance of taking into account the needs of developing \ncountry Parties, especially the Least Developed Countries. \n2. All Parties should cooperate to enhance the capacity of developing country Parties to \nimplement this Agreement, including through regional, bilateral and multilateral approaches, and \nthrough appropriate institutional arrangements.  \n3.  Parties should strengthen their cooperation, including with regard to: \n(a) sharing information, good practices, experiences and lessons learned, including, as \nappropriate, as these relate to science, planning, policies and implementation; \n(b) strengthening institutional arrangements to support the synthesis of relevant information and \nknowledge; \n(c) technology development and transfer in order to improve resource efficiency; \n(d) strengthening knowledge on resource efficiency;  \n(e) education, training, public awareness, public participation and public access to information; \n(f) [...] \n \nComment: A regular issue in international environmental treaties is the capacity of developing countries \nto implement their international commitments. In this respect the treaty would need to address support, \nwhich usually comprises capacity building, technology development and transfer, and financial support. \nMain options: \n- no provisions on financial obligations or a financial mechanism \n- provisions on / a mechanism for mobilising voluntary support  \n- general obligation to support developed countries  \n- general obligation to support developed countries plus financial mechanism and operating entity such \nas GEF, other fund etc. \n- platform for scientific and technology transfer; potentially: link to industry;  FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 245 \n - Institutions? Could link to IRP, but might not be useful because IRP is small and might be better as an \nindependent body. \n- provisions on further development of the treaty \n \nArticle 7 - Institutions \n1. Conference of the Parties - supreme body of this Agreement. Standard clause as e.g. in Paris \nAgreement: It shall perform the functions assigned to it by this Agreement and shall: \n(a) Establish such subsidiary bodies as deemed necessary for the implementation of this \nAgreement; and \nComment: This would inter alia allow establishing a body for engaging with non-party stakeholders such \nas industry representatives. In addition, the treaty could explicitly provide a mandate to establish means \nfor such engagement. \n(b) Exercise such other functions as may be required for the implementation of this Agreement. \n2. Secretariat - standard functions.  \n3. Permanent Subsidiary Body - e.g. on Science and Technical Advice.  \nComment: Are there other functions for the COP, Secretariat, or Susidiary Body, that are not standard but \nspecific to RE and for which a mandate would be needed? Example: Data collection; Reviewing reports?  \n4. [To be discussed: Link to specific institutions such as the IRP.] \n \nArticle 8 - Annexes \n1. Annexes are an integral part of this Agreement. \n2. Procedure for parties to join and withdraw from annexes. \n3. Procedure for amending existing and adopting new annexes. \n \nArticle 9 - final clauses: entry into force etc. \n1. Signature, ratification, EU clause. If a global treaty is envisaged, we recommend that 50 \nratifications required for entry into force. In any case no less than 30. \n2. Other standard issues and clauses: Entry into force, reservations, amendments, dispute settlement, \ndepositary, withdrawal, authentic texts. \n \nAnnex 1 - Resource efficiency for abiotic resources \n \nArticle 1 - Scope  \nThis annex applies to [ definition of scope regarding abiotic resources ] \nArticle 2 - Goals, targets and indicators  \n[Sector and raw material specific analysis, goals/targets and indicators.] \nComment: A key challenge will be to consider which, if any, targets and indicators could be useful and \nfeasible specifically in a treaty, i.e. a legally binding instrument at the international  level. For instance, FKZ 3716 33 100 0 - Options under international law to increase resource efficiency \n 246 \n goals targets and indicators can be formulated as quantitative or qualitative. In addition, they can be \nformulated as collective or individual. A treaty can combine all options. \n- In this draft we do not draw a categorical distinction between the terms \"goal\" and \"target\". Both \nspecify and guide how parties are to pursue the overarching objective in Article 1 of the Agreement. The \nterm \"goal\" may seem more general and \"target\" may suggest that is measurable. For instance, the UN's \n17 Sustainable Developments Goals are underpinned by 169 \"targets\". However, some of the SDG \"goals\" \ncould be regarded as measurable (\"end poverty in all its forms everywhere\"), while some of the \"targets\" \nwould not seem so (\"By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural \nresources\"; \"Promote public procurement practices that are sustainable\").  \n- As a means to an end, indicators can provide a common understanding on what goals and targets mean \nand how to measure progress towards achieving them. Specifically for a treaty under international law, it \nshould be taken into account that only states that agree to a treaty are bound by it, and that the \nobligations frequently are of a higher level of abstraction than national or EU laws. Further discussion \nshould inter alia address: Which targets and indicators would be suitable specifically for the \ninternational level and for supporting certain objectives, bearing in mind that the different views and \ncapacities of other states? Which targets or indicators could be mentioned in the treaty in a general \nmanner, and what could be deferred or mandated for parties to elaborate and agree later on? \n \nArticle 3 - Undertakings  \nEach party should require undertakings  which are public-interest entities exceeding on their balance \nsheet dates the criterion of the average number of 500 employees during the financial year922 to make \navailable to the public information regarding resource efficiency. [Further details, see comment] \nComments:  \n- Compared to international legal practice, this would be rather specific obligation. It is important to keep \nin mind that this would remain an obligation on the parties at the international level to then oblige the \ncompanies at their respecitve respective national levels. A softer version could be an obligation to \n\"promote\" reporting by companies, e.g. in Article 4.1 of the Agreement.  \n- In order to define reporting obligations, some degree of clarity might be needed on which companies or \nfacilities should report, as well as on how to report. However, since parties might regard this as unsually \nintrusive, taking into account different national circumstances and capacties would be key.  \nThe treaty could, for instance, merely set broad and unspecified requirements: This would be similar to \nthe EU directive on non-financial reporting which leaves substantial room for specification to national \ngovernments. The potential downside is insufficiently ambitious and incoherent implementation by \nparties. On the other hand, broad leeway for states could increase political buy-in and acceptance. \nThe Agreement could also refer to an existing (sustainability oriented) reporting framework. One \nexample is the EU-Regulation on conflict minerals923, which is links some of its obligations to the OECD \nDue Diligence Guidance. The potential problem with this approach is that the internationally most \nprominent reporting frameworks like GRI are developed by private entities, which raises issues of \nlegitimacy, political buy-in and changes. \nThe treaty could defer all or part of this issue by mandating future discussion by parties on guidance. \n \n922 Definition taken from EU CSR directive, Directive 2014/95/EU of 22.10.2014 amending Directive 2013/34/EU as regards \ndisclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups, OJ L 330, 15.11.2014, p. 1\u20139. \n923 Regulation (EU) 2017/821 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2017 laying down supply chain due \ndiligence obligations for Union importers of tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores, and gold originating from conflict-\naffected and high-risk areas, OJ L 130, 19.5.2017, p. 1\u201320.
